INVOCATION Our Father, who art in Heaven, we thank Thee for Thy grace and mercy. We thank Thee for the things with which Thou art beautifying the earth, for all the good things about us, and for all the smiles and sunshine around about us. We thank Thee for the righteousness and beauty Thou hast put into our lives and for the many and abundant blessings that have been ours. We thank Thee for the associations among men and for the work that is being done to bring forth better things upon this earth. We pray that Thou wouldst bless the work that this Society is engaged in, and we pray that their labors may be successful. Bless the officers in charge of this meeting and bless all the members of this Association, and may their meeting here be pleasant and profitable. All this we ask in Thy Son's name; Amen. President Green: Mr. Kidd was to have delivered the address of welcome, but since he can not be with us the wel - come will be extended by Mr. D. S. Dalby. WELCOME D. S. DALBY Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, and members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society — It is not in my line </seg>
            <seg id="p041">41 of business to make speeches, and whenever I am called upon for one I never know what to say. I am glad, however, to ex - tend a very hearty welcome to you on behalf of the citizens of Beatrice and Gage county, and to say that we will be glad to do whatever we can to make your stay here pleasant and interesting and profitable. I presume that in your discus - sions you will take up the question of crossing the potato and onion and probably that of the strawberry and milk-wtiil. But seriously, I do want to urge upon you not to overlook in your discussions the luscious, big, red Jonathan apple. I have not been a resident of Nebraska more than two or three years, but in that time I have never seen better apples anywhere than those grown right here in Nebraska. And more and better opportunities for horticulturists are not offered anywhere than in this state. And on behalf of the citizens of Beatrice and Gage county and the entire community I want to extend to your Society a most sincere welcome. We are all very glad that you have come here for your meeting, and we hope it will be pleasant and interesting to you as well as profitable to us. And if there is anything that you don't see that you want, let us know and we will get it for you. Thank you. Evident Green: Mr. C. S. Harrison, of York, will re - l on behalf of the Society to the welcome so generously ded to us by Mr. Dalby. RESPONSE C. S. HARRISON, YORK. Mr. Chairman and Friends — In response to these kind words of welcome I want to say that we arc glad to be here, and I want to say also that our calling is the best and noblest on earth. We are aiming to bring out new things and better things, and while we do this we are going to do it in an honorable way. We do not want any grafting or stealing; </seg>

Iesident Qreea : Governor Shallenberger was to have with us this afternoon, but he was unavoidably detained ncoln by matters of state, and has just sent word that in not get here. The next subject on our program is of "Perennials" by Mr. Williams, of Grand Island. PERENNIALS. ED. WILLIAMS, GRAND ISLAND. Mr. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen: Iavinf been put on the program for a paper on Hardy •nnials, I will submit to you as far as my experineee goes varieties best suited for our climate and a few remarks at planting and caring for same. As this is the season of the year for a florist to make re - pairs and replant, and get his house in shape for winter, I have not had the time to prepare you a very complete paper, but I will give you the main facts; and as for varieties I could name hundreds, yes, more, but it is the same with plants as anything else, we have our stand hys. The term perennials stands for plants of herbaceous nature, that are hardy and will live through the winter without kill - big off. There is an increasing demand for this line of plants i -vt tv vear. As more people secure their own homes the • ■ Mr tr * </seg>
            <seg id="p043">43 I thing they set about to do is to beautify the same, and v hardy plants of the perennials will do that. There an - tall growing varieties, dwarf, and the border ones, so it is immaterial what corner or nook you care to plant, can find among the varieties I will mention some that Iie most essential point is in the preparing of soil, for uu - tender plants that are replaced every year, the soil will ■ out; so get your soil good and rich; spade over well deep. Every three or four years, the plants should be q up and divided; that is, of those that are subject lat kind of treatment and others that come from seeds, seed should be sown, so that you can replenish your &gt;ly, and the best time to do that is in the fall. They should receive a mulch of some kind every spring and fall. In the following varieties, I have endeavored to name only a few of the best, those that I know will succeed, with ordin - ary care, and which you can secure from your local florist or nurseryman. The blooming period for perennials is from about the middle of May until frost. Achellia — The Pearl. Aquilegia — Columbine, all colors Asters, all colors. Bellis — The English Daisies, white. Campanulas — The Bellflower, all colors. Centaurea — Corn Flowers, all colors. Chrysanthemums — The pompon varieties, all colors. Dianthus — Sweet William, all colors. Dielytra — Bleeding Heart, pink and white. Digitalis — Fox Glove, all colors. Funkia — Day Lily. Ferns (Flowering fern) (Sensitive fern).

Mr. Williams: No, they are all perennials for outdoor growing, — hardy varieties. C. S. Harrison : It seems to me that there are others well worthy of mention in such a list, such as the poppies; then there are the Hibiscus, — of these I have five different kinds and they are all very satisfactory. I would add also to that list the Iris; on this I am now preparing a work, which will till of some 170 varieties. President Green : I would like to call your attention to the last thing on our program, — the question box. In case there is any question you want to ask on anything pertaining to horticulture we will be glad to take it up and answer it the </seg>
            <seg id="p045">DISTRICT NO. 1U. 45 Ir. Brown : I just want to add a word to what Mr. Uarri - las said about perennials. In the last two or three y&lt; re been experimenting to a certain extent with perennials, lipally for my own pleasure; and I find that there an y things that we can grow successfully in Nebraska that lon't usually think of. I have growing at my place now deciduous cypress trc-es, and I guess that is UK) mil* - 9 north of its habitat. We can make things cover a much t field than we ever dreamed of. Mr. Harrison: I have noticed that many things that arc perfectly hardy in Minnesota are not hardy here. Then same things some of them planted here will kill right down to the ground the first winter.

District Director. QUESTION ItOX Question No. 1. (On raspberries.) Answered by Mr. Friteh : 1 have raised raspberries i i&gt;r less for the past fifteen years, in Iowa and Nebraska. At the present time I am located at Ashland, where I think it is very satisfactory for the growing of raspberries. At Ashland we now have the Cumberland, Cardinal, Kan - sas, etc., for the best ones and a few others. The Cardinal I 1 ll ink is one of the best berries we have. As to the time for planting raspberries, for mo the right time is in the fall. just before it freeaea up. Ft depends, of course, upon the condition of the "ground. As a general thing, the ground i* in good shape just before it snows, and I have sever had any trouble at all about getting a good stand. I never lose any plants at all ; always get 100 per cent of a stand. The ground should be well prepared. This season we have had a good dial of trouble with the weeds, but inside of another week I think we will get rid of the most of thorn. And when I plant I plant only the host plants. I plant them q«He deep and rais. - a little mound right over the plant, — about four inches deep and then in the spring level it off and they come good. As I said before, the Cumberland and Cardinal and Kansas an' the leading ones; tho Cardinal is the only red raspberry I would plant. They all come through the winters in good Question No. 2. (As to soil for perennials. ) Bswered by Mr. Williams: I believe the soil should bo ", it seems to be better than a light soil. And when you reparing to plant hardy outdoor perennials always have C.

Mr. Harrison : In planting perennials it is quite important in r it them pretty deep so they will not dry out. Iesident Green : A good deal of common sense and judg - can be used in regard to the different kinds of soil. In ing carnations I find that we have a soil which is doing well without any fertilizing at all ; in fact the plants to grow too rank at that. Question No. 3. (As to the packing of apples.) Answered by Mr. Pollard: As to packing apples in boxes we have had no experience at all with boxes; we have always uscl barrels for our apples. This practice saves packing ami handling. In a barrel you can put three bushels, and in the ordinary box there is only one bushel, and a man can pack a barrel almost as quickly as a box. Then the barrel is the cheaper, too. We think the barrel is decidedly the best way for marketing apples. President Green : If there are no more questions this after - noon we will adjourn until eight o'clock this evening. .Meeting adjourned till 8:00 P.M. EVENING SESSION. 8 :00 P.M. President Green: The first subject on our program for this evening will be "Parks in Villages and Small Towns," by Mr. McCandless, of Wymore. Mr. McCandless has been interested in this work for several years, and through the experience and results he has accomplished at Wymore he is in position to give us some good information and help. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">49 PARKS IN VILLAGES AND SMALL TOWNS. A. I). M'CANDLESB, YVYMOBE Mr. Chairmau, Ladies, and Gentlemen Em very glad that I am lure tonight. I see that you have unfortunate in that Mae of the people who were to been htnv with you could not conic, but 1 want you to s.s that I am here and also to know that I am intcns.lv ■stcd in the grand work in which your Society is engaged. On this subject of Parks in Villages and Small Towns I have nothing to offer except my experience. My subject does not require exact or scientific knowledge, m many of your more technical subjects do. and as the audience is small and as those who are lure are all interested in this work, I shall give you a little back history tonight and suggest one or two places for the extension of park work among small towns and villages in Nebraska. My park work has all been done in the little city of Wymore, — a place of three thousand people, in the southwest corner of this county, and while it is a place of only about three thousand people, let me tell yi hi that it has more parks — more acreage iu parks — than any other city of its size in the whole country. We can show you more growing trees in park areas than .can be found in any other town or city in the state of Nebraska today. We can show you a town that is thoroughly a railroad town and for twenty-five years was a saloon town, and yet it is a town more interested in park work than can be found where in the state. My own home in Wymore is built on a half block of ground. When I built on that half block of ground it was all covered with cockle burs and sunflowers and surrounded by that kind of vegetation. I graded the streets around my place and ■owed a few handfuls of red clover in the streets outside of the lawn space, and soon after that T noticed that the people would bring their cows half a mile to let them eat in T1YH1 f" ftf* Til V Til *1 OO T 1 sl* (M~\ til Olll W Vl\* tTlOV i 1 1 ll TH~fct" flrt &lt;iq T </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 NEBRASKA STATE HORTKTI.Tl KAI. SOCIETY had done and have feed for their cows near at hone, and thej siiid they didn't know that iln-v could, lint now nearly every street in Wyniore is sownl to clover or blue pill, and they IK mowed and kept dean. too. And at this lime two mow in*; machines have been kept going constantly for over two wet ks in the parks and streets of our town. &lt; Mir park system was started a good many years ago, and at that time 1 contributed flO toward buying a park. One of (tur parks is a beautiful piece of woodland lying just easi of the Blue river. We are trying to ge&lt; that in shape so it will he one of our most beautiful parks and of value to the future generations. The overflow of the river is a serious question there, however. The llarlington railroad has a dam arrow the Blue river bottom there at Wyinore that is three-fourths of a mile long. They say this is all right, for they have ranted the bridge four feet higher. The river bottom is dammed up there by two railroads though, and there are other things I might mention. We are going to keep on with what we have and do the bes; we can. Here al I lea trice you people have the Blue river and at Wymore we have the river and Indian creek, too. and along these streams there are many beautiful and shady groves. There at Wymore we could have many more beautiful spots if we could grt the obst ruci ions removed and let the water go °'&lt; ( ' :lsl - After we had gotten tlie Kiverside Park and had it overflow a couple of times we thought wo would gH a better place This is a very beautiful ■pot, though, and covered with fine timber. When the Lin - coln Land Company laid out the town there was a beautiful piece of timber on Indian creek. There were twenty acres in that piece of timber, and the title of that land was with the Lincoln Land Company. It has been used as a park ever since the town was first started, and it is the one park in Wymore to which the city does not have title now. These parks, though, are both down on the river and creek and are not accessible to the people. We do have other parka thai are more accessible. We have a park called Arbor State- Park, so named because we had a paper by that name, which </seg>
            <seg id="p051">51 was published by one of our citizens. Aud tliis man, while lie had many faults, nevertheless did much good work and helped those of us engaged in park work. This park con - of more than thirty-three acres, and there is not another spot equal to it in the state of Nebraska. The laud belongs to the city, and it will grow more valuable as time passes. The \\&lt;&gt;rk of keeping these parka up, however, will fall upon future generations and they will get much of the l&gt;euetit from them. McKinlev Park is another one of our spots to which the city has acquired the legal title; this consists of two blocks of ground with the street between vacated and added to it. In this little park there are nearly six hundred splendid trees growing. In all the parks of Wymore now there are some two thousand trees being cultivated, and they range from four to eight years of age. .Many yean ago we had a very good man in Wyinore. — a man who was for several years Secretary of this Society, — L. M. Rumell. He was for several years a member of our city council and also a member of the school board. While he was a member of the school board he had the high school grounds planted to shade trees; there were forty - two of them, — ash and elm interspersed alternately. It is only a question of time, however, until the elm will have to come out. Our high school ground i* one of the most beauti - ful sj)otK in the country; those trees have been taken care of and the grounds well looked after. Another thing we do in our parking system, and that is to park all of the little triangular spots here and there. We don't number these in our parka though, but just call it park - ing our street-ends. We have two streets in the residence section of the city that are one hundred feet wide and we are parking each of these with a little park ten feet wide down tho center of them. At the Burlington station the railroad company has a beautiful little park where the people while waiting can enjoy the Haade and plants. While many of our people are interested in this work, it has been the result principally of two or three men. And many of them have </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 made fun of me for being so thoroughly interested in this work. Thy said "McCamlless is crazy on parks." We have regular park officers, and in the city treasury we have a park fund. And the cost of these jiiirks to the city is very small indeed. Arbor State Park did not cost the city more than f 15, and I suppose $500 would cover the entire cost of MH'andless Park. There is not $200 outstanding warrants on our park fund. We don't owe a dollar on our parks, and the title for them is in the city. All this work, too, is a matter of record. I drew the ordinances, without any cost to the city, and I got them as I wanted them. The people are interested and aroused now, and the sentiment is spreading for parks and the care and cultivation of them. There is a proposition up now at Wymore to get twenty acres across the river for park purposes. The sentiment for parks and better streets is con - tinually growing, for the people have come to see that it increases the value of their property. I could go into a sec - tion of this town and buy a piece of property and improve it and inside of five years make it the aristocratic section of the town. The people would want to move around to that part of the town. In Wymore I had this very experience. As a matter of fact it is a good investment. It is important to get this before the people. Now in the little town of Rarnston, seven miles down the river from where I live, they have a little park of two blocks that will make their town beautiful in a very few years. All that is ne&lt; essary is to show the people that they have the power to pel these little parks; convince them that they can have these things. In Wymore we didn't have any money to start with. We just simply took the parks and then got the money after - wards. To get at the right value of the land for park pur - poses just call in a jury of farmers to appraise the land. If this Association should take up this work there would be no limit to what could be accomplished, and I want to say that I will be only too willing to give my time and labor to helping this Society or any town in the state toward getting </seg>
            <seg id="p053">53 a start at a parking system. 1 shall be glad to draw up ordinances or help in any way I can. The first object, of course, is to get the necessary money for the parks. There is no question at all but what a park system is of value to any town ; and no town in the state of Nebraska should be without a park or parking system of some sort. The property values around these parks increase so rapidly that we get our money back in a very few years. Here is a little booklet that 1 haw. - to pass around, and in it you will tind a good deal of valuable information as to how to proceed. Now I am going to ask you to excuse me from going into this subject much further. This park idea is not new to you ; but it is new to the people of these small towns and villages. It has been less than thirty years that the city of Boston asked the legislature of Massachusetts to make an appropria - tion for their parks. Since 1879 Boston has spent more than 13,000,000 on her park system, and it is cleaimed that Boston today has the finest park system of any city in the world. So you see that the idea is not old even in Boston, — in that state of culture and learning. If those states in the East had taken up this question of parks and more beautiful streets years ago it would not have cost them nearly so much as it does now. In nearly every town or city now you find some kind of woman's club or society that is interested in city im - provement, and it is to the ladies that we must look for higher ideals along such lines. The men seem to be too busy for much of this kind of work, but when you do find a man with high ideals and who is interested in this sort of work you might know that his mother was a lady and had high ideals. So I say if we can get the ladies of Nebraska interested in this work of parks and tree planting and city improvement there will be great good accomplished. It is the greatest work and noblest work outside of horticulture; in fact it is horticulture in a sense. And now before I sit down I want to extend to the Nebraska State Horticultural Society a hearty invitation to come to Wymore for your next meeting. </seg>

And we will show you a little town that for beauty is not surpassed by any in the state. I want to say again that I am ready at any time to help you men along the lines that 1 have spoken of and do what I can to assist in any way this worthy cause. Bwant to thank you for the kind invitation to be with and to take part on your program here tonight, and I k you also for your kind attention and the interest you in th"s subject. ( Applause. ) Ir. Yager: Mr. Chairman, in view of the splendid talk McCandless has given us on this subject of parks and also iew of the good work he has done along this line I want uggest that he be made an annual honorary member of Society. f 1 . MeCandless: I wish you would remove that "honor - condition and let me pay my dollar the same as the of you do. By a unanimous vote Mr. McCandless was made an annual honorary member of the Society. B"esident Green: The next subject on our program this ing is that of "Evergreens," by Mr. C. S. Harrison, ork. EVERGREENS. C. 8. HARRISON, YORK. (rich prairie farm is a canvas and the farmer should be an rt, painting on it a beautiful picture. This can easily one if he gives the same attention to horticulture that ht i to grain and stock raising. The one is as important as other and should not be Mglected simply because it is fashion to ignore it. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">55 TIIK MISSION OF EVEUliKKL.N Gu into a northern forest in the stillness of the winter and the scene has its charms. The branches are laden with snow, and you have.' the sunlight glinting on the white and green, and then you are impressed with a sense of security and COM - fort. The mercury runs about three degrees higher than out in the open. Vou have a feeling that you are being sheltered and protected. This same security and comfort can, in a measure, be transferred to the prairie home. It can easily be done and witli very little expense, l'eople have two erroneous ideas. One is evergreens are so hard to handle and another is that they are of such slow growth they will do nothing fur you in a lifetime. I handled right, you can transplant them as easily as you •lm or cottonwood, and on account of their rapid growth are the terror of the nurserymen. Out in our field are lerosa or Hull Pines, only three years old and once trans - ted that are twelve to eighteen inches tall. They are well established and ready to make from one to two growth each year. Scotch and Austrian Pines are about same, so with Douglas Spruce, while Jack Pines are the 'tiest of all. O.ME THINGS TO BKMK.MBEK In planting evergreens, you must get those that naturally grow nearest to you. The Ponderosa Pine is peculiarly adapted to all that region lying between the Missouri river and the Kocky mountains. For the hot plains of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska, they should lie grown from teed secured from the foothills of Colorado. For .Minnesota, the Dakota*, and Manitoba seed should be obtained from the high - est altitudes of the Rockies or the northern ;ind highest ra of the Black Hills or Wyoming;. The Contorta and Aristarta Pines, the Engleinanii Spruce, and Piuigens gTow at high elevations and would therefore succeed well in the North. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 People often make this mistake. A mail in northern NV - ka wishes to plant a lot of red cedar, lie nuds those raised iu southern Illinois quoted at about half the price of the Platte Cedar grown nearer home, lie gets a few thousand. They may do well for a year or two and then a hard winter knocks them ali out. Another wants to plant some White Spruce, lie bean that imported ones can Ik 1 had cheap and he buys some. They prove to be worthless. Then he gets some from seed grown in Maine or New ilamp - shire and they are short-lived, lie has some from northern Minnesota and Wisconsin and they do fairly well. There is a belt of White Spruce which lies along our northern states and swings down into the Black Hills into a climate somewhat analogous to our own. He gets this variety and they hit the spot completely. There are portions of eastern Minnesota, Nebraska, and Kansas where Norway Spruce and White Pine will grow if seed is secured from the nearest northwestern belt, but you try them with Scotch Pine, White and Black Spruce two hundred miles further west and they are a failure. Inexperts recommend Scotch Pine for western Kansas and Nebraska. We who have watched things for thirty-five years, meeting with bitter experience, know bettter. We have seen groves of them in the Republican Valley going down under the sirocco. They can not live. Don't try to make an ever - green with soft foliage live under the 100th Meridian. HERE IS THE SITUATION'. In the West we have the wet and dry cycles which may last for five or six years each. During the wet period, the plains fill up with people and the success of dry burning is heralded far and wide. The people move in with great hope. Trees adapted to conditions farther east are plaute&lt;l and do well for a time. Then comes the dry cycle with the tierce hot winds. White Willow, Soft Maple, Uoxelders, Scotch Pirns, White Pines, and Norway, White, and Black Spruces go down </seg>
            <seg id="p057">57 completely cooked by the siroccos. I heard an instructor s;i\, "Yob give the trie's the forest conditions by planting them close together as they grow iu the Black liills and you can raise evergreens anywhere in Nebraska." Perhaps, if you could elevate the country 4000 feet and spread the Black Hills' climate over it, but you can not with present con - ditions unless you take tm-s adapted to the locality. This ran easily be done. Most of the eleven kinds of Colorado evergreens will do well on the plains. The Ponderosa and Pinon Pines, the Brown and Silver Cedars, grow with the least moisture of any trees. The Ponderosa propagates itself on bald bluffs where nothing else will grow and it would probably have covered all our northern and western plains had it not been for the fires. They have saved themselves by perching like the cliff-dwellers beyond the reach of danger where they wave defiance while they cling to the sides of precipices or from almost inaccessible hilltops away from the reach of the fires. There is probably not a section of land on our western plains that might not be covered with these thrifty and heroic trees. When their character is known and people understand the ease with which they can be grown, our semi-arid regions will be filled with groves and windbreaks which will check the fury of the hot winds and make dry farming a signal success. THEIE PUOPAGATION. Tou can raise them by the thousand as easily as you can peas. I am emphasizing this for this pine is the hope of the plains, and when I am gone people will remember what I say and benefit by my experiments. Nurserymen, and myself among them, have been on the wrong track. We did not un - derstand this pine, and we treated it like other evergreens, planting under screens, and they resented it. They did not want any coddling; when covered they would damp off badly. In making a trip to the Black Hills, I saw a fine patch of </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 tkeK young trees growing on Lard pau where the soil bail all been acmpud oil for the embankment. Near by wen the l&gt;ar«-ut trees. Then 1 reanoned, these seed* fell iu ihe fall. The slush ami siiow covered them, they ranie up before the ground hail time to dry oft', and there they are. The next fall, with thanks to good old mother Nature for the lesson, I planted some seeds, about a pound to eight feet square, and &lt; uvered with a half inch of fine earth or sand, either would do. And lo! the problem was solved. They came up with great rigor early in the spring. Damping off is the great trouble with raising evergreens. Often a man will have a tine stand, and all at once they will be mowed down in a day. The trouble is that the heat comes on before they have put on their second set of leaves while they are yet tender. Now, by sowing in the fall the plants get an early start and put on the second set of leaves and thus are immune before the ex - cessive heat strikes them. Use these precautions and your success is sure. Do not allow birds or squirrels to interfere with the buds. Do not allow them to dry while germinating. In preparing the bed, take some clean ground, spade up the earth a foot deep, rake it down fine, level it, and put in the seed in rows, if you like. Put it in rather thick, cover with half an inch of fine earth or sand. If you can't get seed in the fall, then about the 15th of April soak it till it sprouts in warm water, changed every twelve hours to keep it from sour - ing. Plant as directed as soon as the sprouts begin to show. When they come up they begin to go down, and the first year they will have roots twelve to fifteen inches long. If they are grown in the open, toughened to the heat of summer and the cold of winter, you can plant them out when a year old. If too dry in the spring, yon can wait another year, but I linve had splendid success with yenrlings. When you diir. drift under the bed and get the full length of the root, for you need it all. Nature made no mistakes in furnishing it nt such a length to support these long needles. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">59 The moment your trees are dug they inust be put ill a pail of water. Get dowu ou your knees, take a tree with your left hand, place it against the upright bank of your trench, and with the right hand bring the loose dirt against it, pressing it down. Of course the root is doubled in. Put them three or four inches apart. After you have planted a while take the hoe and till the trench, ■tamping the earth solid on cithef side. One serious trouble in planting erergreoM is tl: • earth is not packed solid enough around them. In a day or two go over the surface with a hoe or rake to loosen the top ami keep it from drying out. You will soon get on to it and can plant two or three thousand in a day, with little trouble. THE COST, The seeds are hard to get. There are not enough saved. They usually run about $2.00 a pound. At the lowest esti - mate, you should have four thousand to the pound. You might get twice that amount. It does not take long to plant them. After transplanting let them stay two years, when they will be a foot or more in height, with splendid roots. Now plant them in a grove or windbreak. Cultivate well the first year. It would pay you to cultivate thoroughly for several years. I have raised these pines for years in this way, in the dryest and hottest seasons, with no irrigation except that given with a diligent hoe, without losing more than five per cent. You can plant eight feet apart each way and put some deciduous trees between them which must be cut out before they begin to crowd, or you can plant potatoes or beans or some sweet corn in alternate rows. Strong field corn might be too rank. In planting beware of spots infested with white grubs unless you see the ground ridged with moles. which are the farmer's best friends. I had $1000 worth of evergreens destroyed in one season by those grubs, as the moles had not found them. These never eat vegetables but always eat grubs and worms, and their presence is a sure </seg>

These pests multiply so rapidly that were it not for our underground friends they would hike the earth. On my place, I count every nude worth #."&gt; at lent The Ponderosa Pine is the best known for the Wesi. 1 (»ine brought a lot of collected trees from the mountains and cultivated them well the (irst year and then, to test them, left them alone to tight their way with drought and weeds. For two years it was very dry, and I do not see how a drop of water could have reached the roots, and yet they made a foot a year, and where cultivated, they grew two feet. There has been a prejudice against this tree because we are told they are so hard to transplant. This is because so many have attempted to grow these trees pulled from the forests. The trouble with the forest tree is, when you go after it, the root is not at home, it is out foraging, you just get the stub. Grow them according to directions and you can raise them as easily as you can potatoes. Perhaps you do not wish to bother with the seeds and prefer to try plants. These at one year old, selected strong ones, are about $1 per hundred ; two year old transplanted, $3 per hundred ; fine three year old, transplant - ed, f 5 per hundred. THE JACK PIXE — PINTS DIVARICATA, While young, is by far the most rapid-growing of all our evergreens. There are two varieties of this tree. The eastern type is a poor, bushy, stunted affair. The Northwestern variety is a tree of great vigor, and in its native forests is packed and crowded like the Pinus Contorta of the Yellow - stone, which is a field of masts crowded thickly together. This tree is now in great demand for railroad ties. In a trip to the North I saw thousands of them beside the track which, having had a treatment of creosote, were made quite durable, and the amount that could be secured from an acre was some - thing wonderful. This tree grows rapidly on any kind of soil. I have known them to make two aud one-half feet a year on a clay bank, without cultivation. </seg>
            <seg id="p061">61 EVERGREENS. Wars ago, the Bruner Brothers, under direction of Dr. IVinow, then V. B. Chief of Forestry, planted several thousand in the sandhills of western Nebraska. They could not plow the land on account of the drifting of the sand, so they were put in and left to themselves, without cultivation or irrigation. Under those unfavorable conditions, they are now making two feet a year and scattering se&lt;&gt;d.s so that young plants are coming up all mud them. Nearly one fourth of our great state is a desolation — a succession of sand banks now worth $1 per acre, but a sand bank is a cordial invitation to a pine tree. These almost worthless lands planted to Jack Pines, which would cost, delivered, about $10 per thousand, would, in a short time have a present ami prospective value of $100 or more per acre. I^and is rising in value, and the wonder is that such an opportunity is so long neglected. The trouble with us as a people is, we never can wait to grow a crop of acorns. We won't do any - thing for the future. We must have immediate results. A man should realize that there is a future, md he is related to it. lie can plant a forest which will oonf'nue his usefulness as a benefactor long after he is dead, lie can create conditions which will surround his memory with a halo. You plant forty acres of pines. You see them growing while you live. Your name and history are in them. You pass away and thousands the work of your hands, and as they walk through those long aisles, overarched with green, they will bless your memory. If you are not immortal then live and die like a dog. If you believe you are to live forever, leave something behind you to let people know you passed this way and left blessings in your path.

In many parts of the Middle West the air is dry and then - is but little rain or damp snow in the winter. Lumber is p-t - tinj,' out of reach, and yet cattle need better shelter than a wire fence. Lay off a quarter of an acre or more, according to the size of your herd. Have the ground in the best of cultivation, around this put two rows of Austrian of Ponde - rosa Pine. If toward the 1110th .Meridian, take the latter. Have the rows eight feet apart and put the trees the same distance apart in the row, breaking joints. Give the trees the best cultivation. They will cost you five to ten sents apiece. In five jean you have quite -\ shelter which is jrrowinir better each year. The lower branches touch and the double row keeps out the wind. In about ten years you can cut otT tlir - limbs as they project into the yard so the cattle can get under them. At this staire the trees arc making a splendid srrowth and irivinir tine protection. Put your stacks in the center, you can use a movable top. The trees will defend your hay from the winds and storms. Tn fifteen or twenty years yon have a splendid shelter. You just plant the trees and Nature puts on the sidinjr and covcrintr. While a timber barn would decrease in value, this is jjettin^ better and hotter. The yard should be cleaned out every spring and sowed to corn or sorphnm. The jrround should be plowed, otherwise too much manure would injure the trees. </seg>

The Ponderosa, witli long and glistening aeedloa is very attractive. The Scotch l'ine is light green. In short, an evergreen grove, with a dozen kinds of trees ghrea a rich harmonious blend of color. The view is an attending delight. You have here a picture of warmth and cheer and this, too. when all else seems dead and gloomy, which is indeed a wide contrast to the somber earth and universal winter desolation. In transplanting evergreen* of larger sizes than we have Mentioned, immediately after digging, they should Im&gt; dipped in a puddle of thick mud, made of the richest soil. Some use i lay on account of its adhering so closely to the roots, but it has been found that if this should dry, it forms an im - pervious coating which the tiny rootlets can not ]&gt;enetr So use rich loam for the mud, and your tree is virtually planted from the start. Trees thus protected, can be handled with safety out in the field. If there is danger of drying out before you can plant all of them, dip them again. Thus you seal the roots air tight. In planting be sure to firm the earth solid about the root. It is not enough to get up a war dance on the surface, you must Bee the earth is packed solid on the roots. Often trees thought to be well planted can be moved up and down like a churn dash, which shows the work has been poorly done.

In that case, you must always dig around the tree, secure a ball of earth with the roots, and bind or sow burlap snug around it, ihcu water it thoroughly. In this way you can move it. In planting evergreens of any size always plant in a depression, and not on a ridge. In planting large tret's, have a good - sized hole; put fine earth next to the roots to nourish them the first year and water thoroughly. You will have to watch trees set in the yard and water often the first year. Have them in a depression which will hold a tub of water and fill it often if dry. Onee established, they will endure most any kind of weather. THE PROTECTED AND TNTUOTECTED HOME. What would you think of a man who would not defend his home, who would not keep out any baneful influence at any cost? A man once came to me with tears in his eyes and amid his sobs said, "There is a man who comes to my house who is supplanting mo in my wife's affections and my home is broken up" and then he broke down in a wail of despair, "What shall I do?" "Do, why just give that fellow a half a mile ride on the toe of your boot." "Oh, I can't do that," and so he allowed his wife to get a divorce and marry a brute who soon killed her with cruelty and his children were scattered and he left desolate because he didn't defend his home. A man would naturally protect his home from robbers and he would not care to have it surounded by troops of noisy hoodlums, and yet he will allow that tyrant of the north, Old Boreas, to fairly bombard his home when he comes with the scourge of the North Winds and all the imps and shrieking demons of the storm. He will allow him to assail his dwelling, year in and year out, and make no resistance, whatever.

K' all our lowen the rose is, without doubt, the queen. It &gt;t only the most popular for home gardens bat is also standard forcing flower, the carnation being its ckM [K'titor in this respect. i'veral factors are responsible for the great importance liis plant, such as the following: the wide adaptation of rose, its various type*, and the many fine qualities of its soms. The rose flourishes in the greenhouse and aim very well as a garden flower. Although it prefers special and weather conditions, yet it will give very satisfactory Its when subjected to a variety of conditions. In the genus Rosa we find flowers that bloom at all seasons of the year. Certain classes are perpetual or continuous bloomers, while others send out their masses of bloom at definite intervals. We also have the dwarf, bush, and climb - ing varieties so that it is possible to use the rose in many ways for landscape work. Not only do its wide adaptation, various types, and habits promote its popularity, but its blossoms proper are equaled by but few, if any, of those of other plants. Their range and delicacy of color and fine odor place them in the lead for cut flowers. However, it is not my intention in this paper to &lt;ro into detail regarding rose culture which the size and ini - rw)?"1\fl nof* of flip siiliif^^f" nvoul i~\ w*i 1*1**1 n f T 11101*0! v wisli to ( *iv&lt;* </seg>
            <seg id="p067">67 Ey a few of the main points about their t -iilture. sad to mention a few tilings respecting some rose rarietiei i I have tested under outdoor conditions. First of all in planting roses iu the garden, be sure to cho ■ good location, for it is impossible to remedy the site after the planting has been made. If possible, choose a well-drained southern exposure. Morning sunshine is better than after - noon, if one is forced to make a choice between them bee of limited room. Most roses prefer a good deep rich loam, the hybrid perpetual class reqniringa somewhat heavier soil than the more render varieties. For this reason, after you have ■elected the location, prepare the bed by removing the soil to a depth of two feet. Put about six inches of manure iu the bottom of the bed, and then replace the mil, mixiug it with manure as you replace it. In selecting plants for the bed, obtain those that have bem grown in the nursery, because they will be more accustomed to outside conditions. If you must take greenhouse plants, they should he gradually subjected to the change of conditions by first setting the pots out into a cold frame or other similar nlace. where it will be possible to cover them during the frosty nights of spring. If they are transplanted directly from the greenhouse to the bed, they will be retarded and some of the more tender kinds may be killed on account of the sudden change. Too shallow and too deep planting are alike injurious. If planted too shallow, the roses an- no* well supported and the roots do not do well. On the con - trary, if planted too deep the stems may rot. "Budded" plants are considered as being somewhat better than "owl rooted" ones by the majority of growers. With '•budded" plants, however, one must be verv careful and keep off all ■suckers" that may sprout from the stork portion of the r If the rose bed is deeply prepared in the beginning, it is not necessary to practice d*&gt;ep summer cultivation. Stir the soil often but only to a depth of a few inches. Tn addition to preventing sprouting or sucKerin^ « men i mentioneo </seg>
            <seg id="p068">68 lx-fore, one should keep all flowers or at least all withered Mowers picked in order that they will not detract from the vitality of the plants. Liberal quantities of manure placed alRHit the plants occasionally is also very good for forcing the roses to bloom more freely. When winter approaches, the roses should be mulched with about eighteen inches of leaves or straw. Even the hardier varieties will come out more vigorous in the spring if given a light protection. Pruning is one of the most important factors in rose grow - ing and it is one thing the average person fails to success - fully perform. In general, light pruning will give many flowers, whereas heavy pruning will allow only a few of very large size to be developed. Very little fall pruning is meet* sary. .Merely remove the bushy tops and cut back the long i -a nes so you can protect them better for winter. In the spring, cut back the hybrid perpetual, hybrid tea and moss ruses about two-thirds of the previous season's growth. Such • as the hardy climbers and rugosas should be pruned as little as possible. Cut off about one-fifth of the previous season's growth from such plants and trim out all old and dead shoots. The ro»e is not subject to very many serious insect or fungous troubles. The rose Ixx'tle is considered by many as iM-ing the worst enemy of roses. About the only good way of preventing its ravages is to carefully examine the rose bed every morning and pick off all the beetles that are to be found and destroy them. Rose slugs also become injurious occasion - ally but may be held in check by frequent sprayings with a iroixl insecticide such as lead arsenate (l 1^ pounds to 50 gal - lons of water). This adheres better on the plants than Paris green, and is not so apt to injure the foliage. Several fungous diseases such as the black spot and the mildew frequently affect the rose. In fact, one can scarcely find a rose bed which does not have one or both of these diseases unless such beds have been unususllv well csred for. SDrflviutr with Bor- </seg>
            <seg id="p069">69 deaux or potassium sulphide will nr irwfnllj bold I diseases in check on most of the varieties. In general, it is best for the amateur to buy hi.s plants from the nurseryman or llorist and not depend upon propagating them himself. The only sure way of starting roses, except those which root when layered, M some of the climbers aud Wichuriana, is from cuttings placed iu saud iu the green - house and given bottom heat. A few of the hardy roses may be started from dormant cuttings which are placed iu the open. In making such cuttiugs for outdoor setting take six - inch lengths of the current season's growth and bury them about eighteen inches deep in sandy soil just before the ground freezes in the fall. Cover the soil above them with a thick coat of leaves or straw for winter protection. When spring comes, remove and pluut them out, leaving a single bud above the surface of the ground. Iie varieties which may be grown here are very largely [•mined by our climatic conditions. Certain kinds of i are perfectly hardy and will withstand any of our try - winters; others are half hardy, and still others ai er that they kill during winter even though given the protection. I the spring of 1907 we set out at the Nebraska Expert - ; Station about sixty different varieties of roses (having •al plants of each). The varieties were of various colors represented the different types or classes. We selected - which were especially recommended and had in the lot t 20 different kinds of hybrid perpetuals, 7 or 8 tea roses, jual number of hardy climbers, and 20 kinds of rugosa, id tea, moss and Wichuriana roses. These plants were greenhouse grown, but we hardened them off in a cold frame for a time before planting them out - doors. They received very good care during the summer fol - lowing planting and were carefully mulched the first winter. However, nearly all of the teas and hybrid teas were dead in the spring and the remainder were killed last winter. At </seg>

We find that nearly all schools horticulture as me of the divisions. In the rural schools, horticulture is taught as a correlated subject under the head of nature study, home geography, and agriculture, the nature study work being given in the primary grades, the home geography work in the intermediate grades, and agriculture as applied to the state of Nebraska, in the eighth grade. What we aim at in the work in the public schools is to interest the child in such phases of plant and animal life as are concerned in his environment, and to lead him to the study of such phases of the subject as will enable him to conduct his study along right lines. For this reason, we begin with the plants and animals with which the child is concerned in his home and in his community, going from thence to more general fields in which the child should l&gt;e con - cerned in order that he may have a better appreciation of those phases of tlie subject which are under his immediate obser - val ion. Agriculture is a comparatively new ■abject with us. Our teachers have been preparing as heat they could to teach the ■abject, but we are not yet in a position where it can be handled as affectively as it should be because of the lack of means of thorough preparation on the part of public school hers. Conditions, however, are growing better each year. Our normal schools have put in special departments for teach - ing agriculture, and our normal training high schools, which turn out hundreds of teachers for the rural schools each year, must maintain a course in elementary agriculture. This will soon supply us with teachers who have had some training for the work and will lead to better preparation of teachers, hence to better teaching of the subject. As it is now, we aim at only very elementary work, and encourage the student to make original investigations, to read as extensively as pos - sible from state and national bulletins and other sources </seg>

Holm's all over the state will be much better provided with home-grown fruits, and lawns and dooryards beautified in a way that will not only bring pleasure to the eye, but a profit - able supply of adaptable fruit, as soon as our public sch are able to put in the necessary equipment and provide the tea i hers who can properly correlate the study of agriculture with that of the other branches taught in the public sell Iie Nebraska boys and girls clubs in their work in home ening are bringing about a change in the idea as to what be done in the way of home products in fruits in W ka.

I think I am getting old because memory occasionally runs back to pioneer times. I remember when I tirst saw the state of Nebraska. Crossing on the old steam - boat — the Vice-president — in the year of "76, we entered upon a land practically treeless, and I constantly found something that impressed my memory. .Most of all was the fruitless country, became at that time the railroad had not incorpo - rated the plan of cold storage, when the plains were almost divested of any fruit. I rememl&gt;er, friends, some pioneers and some agents that took cooked carrots and burnt sorghum and called it fruit, but it was just as palatable as burnt bran. There was only one man that held up his head and looked for - ward to the future with any hope of our ever bettering this condition, that man was a professor who made that good fruit, I allude to my old friend, Mr. E. F. Stephens, of Crete. Now, from the beginning of my acquaintance with this eminent member of your Society my personal relations all these years with horticulturists of the state have been most pleasing, and I remember a number of years later, as a student of the state of Nebraska, we as students welcomed his fruits, not only for the treats they contained, but for the exhibits of fruit; PROCEEDINGS. </seg>

I remember of one eminent member Mending in wmpka of cider, and upon examination of it I reported thai there was a great deal of salicylic acid in it, and immediately the students wanted to know v hat effect that would have on the system. I told them that it disturbed digestion hut was said to he good for rheu - matism, and the next day from ihe Dean down every one had the rheumatism. Speaking in a more serious rein, scientific agriculture first began to develop along horticultural lines. Horticulture blazed the way to see what could lie -lone, and when they first set about it to see what would make the field crop a better crop, of the men making agriculture such a success the first scientific agriculturists were horticulturists. So I think, not to make any disparaging comment! on any other workers, we can My truthfully that the horticulturists have stood in the front rank of those dealing with agricultural subjects and of the phenomena therewith. Now I realize that you have an interesting program pre - pared and I must not take up too much of your time. I will dose by formally expressing the gratification the University authorities feel when such a splendid body of men meet here in our rooms, and I hope you will have during your sessions a most agreeable meeting and that everything will be profit - able and pleasant.

I remember in the early dajl what an in - tense longing we had for fruit. With carrots and beets and everything else, I remember when mother used to chop up meat for minee pies. Bwt when I went to York I planted some fruit; I planted some strawberries, but I found that the children were getting in and eating them, so I put up a warn - ing, "Thou shalt not steal," and when I went out to get some strawberries I found that the children were just a little thicker than the strawberries, taking both the ripe and the green ones, too, and I said help yourselves and pick them as fast as you can, and they did. I have lived to see the time when we have Nebraska grown products of fruits, grains, com, wheat, oats, young forests, and thus began the advance - ment along horticultural and forestry lines. I lived amid the students as they swarmed into our University, and I think the Nebraska-grown students are the best and the richest ac - quaintances we have yet received, "and one we have received is a Nebraska-grown Chancellor. We didn't have to import him, but we got just as good a one as there is going; we arc prond of him, we love him, and we will say Ood bless him. Now then. Mr. Chancellor, our Society is near the dividinc of the ways. Tn the first place we loaned our energies toward the development of fruits. Well, that was all right, bnt there is a higher phase, and we are paying especial attention to that. You will find it so east, west, north, and south that they are doing the same. I attended one of those great meetings in Minnesota, where there were over 3,000 members, with a so - ciety where you would think in that forbidding region there would not be anvhody hardly, and there is great enthusiasm. Going farther east yon will find still greater enthusiasm. You may visit the Wizard of the North, Professor Hansen. He is working problems along the same lines. And we want to push to the front.

President Green : The first paper this afternoon is "Grow - ing Raspberries," by Mr. Nation. GROWING RASPBERRIES .J. \V.

K«re are four distinct species of raspberries in cultivation : lack, red, purple, and yellow. Having never grown the 1 two I know nothing about them. The blackcap, or black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) is an American species. Since its introduction in 1832 it has become one of the most important of bush fruits, and is ex - tensively raised for dessert, canning and evaporating; so far as I can learn it is about the only raspberry extensively grown </seg>
            <seg id="p085">85 §e raspberry, like all small fruit, dot's better in a rich, f loam, but will do fairly well iu a sandy loam, especially be rich in humus. Uur first experience in raspberry culture dates back to the spring of 1904, when we purchased 100 plants, supposedly Kansas and Cumberland, of our friend and neighbor, Bra Yager, and so far as we have been able to learn they were Kansas and Cumberland. These were set in good rich Platte river bottom soil, not especially prepared, yet fairly well pre - pared by plowing, harrowing, and clod-smashing or floating. They were set by a green man (your humble servant) and a small boy. We set them in two rows live feet by about 3&gt; L . feet in the rows, by throwing out a spadeful of dirt and theu placing the plant in and Anting the soil well about the roots. Almost every plant lived. They were cultivated with a tive - toothed one-horse cultivator and hoed enough to keep dowu the weeds. They made an excellent growth, and the next year had quite a crop of fine berries, more than enough for table use The second year we cultivated them about the hub the first year, letting them have their own way as to growth and "tipping." They made a great growth, and iu the spriug of 1906, after two or three cultivations, we mulched them very heavily with common prairie hay, and such a crop, loaded with great big berries, that would make one's mouth water. By this time we had read several articles on "care and culture of raspberries" and were getting raspberry wise, and as each and every article had told us to pinch back the young HH we proceeded to pinch them back, also cut out the old caucs when the season was over. Our patch looked fine and we had the pleasure of admiring them all fall, winter, and early spring, but imagine our surprise when one day we examined them only to discover that about four-fifths of them were dead to the ground. Yes, dead ! Right then and there we be - gan to take notice; to sit up and think. Dead! Why had they died ; what had we done, or not done to make them die? That was the question. </seg>

We have been told by "tree agents'' that raspberries are hard to get to live (dead ones are; but we do not believe it, for the reason that what few we have set of our own growing have almost every one lived. The trouble is they are too often burned in handling, and are dead. K'.

            <seg id="p089">89 GROWING AND MARKETING STRAWBERRIES. H. DAVES, BLAIE. * I the growing of strawberries there are at least three fs very essential : One must have a liking for the buui - and be able to stand disappointment ; the right kind of well prepared and plants of varieties to suit his soil ; marketing conditions. In preparing the soil one should commence the year before. 1 like best land that has grown a crop of potatoes or better still tomatoes. After taking off your crop of early potatoes or tomatoes the land should be sown to rye and then in the winter give a good coat of well rotted manure, and when ready for your planting plow under manure and weeds, which by this time will have quite a start. Disc this thoroughly and drag and cross drag until well pulveriezd, and then if possible roll it well with g^oil heavy roller, and now you are ready to get ready to set plants. 1 mark rows two feet apart over the entire field. Then when ready to set plants I make my rows three feet eight and only make them as I set them. 1 my plants a little different than any one I ever saw set them. I had a shovel made about two and one-half inches wide and about ten inches long which I attach to a wheel hoe with good large wheel and if the land is plowed deep and well prepared a man can easily shove this at a depth of five or more inches. Two men, and a boy to drop or carry plants, can plant quite a patch in a day. The man that pushes the plow can set plants about one-half of the time. You ought to be a good Methodist or a member of the Salvation Army. I get right down on my knees. With one hand I raise the loose dirt and I insert the plant with the other, and pack soil well. I suppose there are easier ways than this bat I never have found one any surer to get a stand. As soon as the plants are all set I commence to cultivate both ways. For the first time I use a twelve tooth cultivator, then I </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 alternate wiih a ive uhovel. I tind il the ground u cleuii from track, by cultivating both ways 1 can mve myself much hand work and keep my lield free from wrrtls. 1 do um try ■ave the nrst nuuten, cultivating both ways uuiil 1 waul to begin to lajer the mill which 1 do mostly with nn &lt; ultivator by narrowing it up a little every time. When I have my rows wide enough 1 begin to put ou runnel cutter. 1 had one made from two rolling timers to tit on the front oi the live-shovel cultivator, leaving only three shovels to dig the plants loose I have cut off. 1 keep the cultivator going nearly as long as the growing season. The varieties to plant depend on the markets to a great extent. You must have good solid berries if you ship to dis - tant markets. For the home market you can use the largi r and softer kinds. I have tried many varieties and have dis - carded most of them. Warlield is still very good if well fertilized. Itissell on the right kind of soil is all right. 1 use the Senator Dunlap for fertilizer as it blossoms early and late. Nearly my whole plantation of six acres is Senator Dunlap. I am looking for a better one but have never found it, so if any of you have a better one you will confer a favor by making it known to the writer. I here attach a card show ing my type of the Dunlap. and showing size of two and one - half inches across and six and one-half inches around, six ten filling this box on postal ; twenty to fill these cans. Four acres in one picking gave 204, (rates selling for .Sii.T." per crate F. O. B. Blair, Neb., a net of fllO per acre. Wt never try to grow strawl&gt;erries without mulching. I mulch with clean wheat straw if I can get it as soon as the ground freeies, just enough to hide plants. I do not remove much of this mulch, only enough in the thick places to lot plants come through freely.

To lad good careful pickers is a hard job. for one careless one. can easy spoil and leave on vines more than his picking amounts to. I believe where there are many growers there should be a good growers' association to market at the best advantage. 1 might add a few words as to spraying. I am intending to use the best spray. Sometimes the Dunlap is bothered by the leaf rollers. I will use Parti green with the lime for this purpose, being careful not to spray after Ix'rries have set. There is much more that could be written about the deli - cious strawberry, which has become M ■tapir as our bread, meat and sugar. I find that the more we think we know about the ■trawberrj the more we find that we do not know. I might answer a few anticipated questions. In growing these h&lt; yields of berries I have never used any commercial fertilizer only plenty of good stable manure and gcxxl cultivation. I Jest results have been obtained by a thin mated row ab&lt;&lt;nt fourteen inches wide. I would like some information .1 beat method of tallying and paying pickers. I have thought of having metal checks so as to give a check for each carrier - ful as they are brought in and have them cashed at the bank the same as a paper check. I use only large well r&lt;» plants from new plantings. I-esident Green : In regard to this method of tallying, if ; are any questions you would like to ask in regard to this ivberry growing proposition, put it into the question box we will have it answered. There are several competent good strawberry growers present, and if there is anything want to ask about, write it on a piece of paper and put in juestion box, and we will have it answered the last thing DISCUSSION </seg>

SHAVEK, COLLEGE VIEW. Mr. President and Gentlemen : In preparing my paper on grapes I left out a great deal i -xpei-ting that you would ask me questions and bring out the points you wanted to know about my manner of growing grapes. There ie one thing I would like to speak of before I commence reading my paper and that is, this location is favorable to grapes. When you go a way north of here, as far ;is they have to be covered in the winter, they fail in their mode of covering becmoM they simply put straw over them, and in that way they shirt sooner than those that are left uncovered, so finally jre had to take first and bury them in the dirt and let the dirt freeze hard and put some straw over the dirt so that the frost wouldn't thaw out. That nirans that you can hold them hack, but if you cover them with straw only they start sooner. They have a similar trouble in the South. My own opinion is that this is one of the besl localities for growing grapes because they can be left on the trellis all winter. They don't start as soon as they do when they are laid down, and we have plenty of sun - shine and moisture. With me, grape growing has been very successful in a small way. Probably there isn't any fruit that is grown that is of any more importance, if as much, as the grape. Going back to the ancient times you will find in the Scriptures in Isaiah a prophesy where the prophet speaks about growing grapes even in the world to come. There he says : "They have built houses and planted vineyards." A little further down when he speaks of the spies they sent out, and the fruit brought back, he says: "They brought back bunches of grapes." I </seg>
            <seg id="p093">93 I believe that Palestine is any better than Nebraska tor in}; (rape*. Again the Saviour aaya: "I will drink no of the fruit of the vine until I drink it anew with you in 'ather's kingdom." And you know again what Pan] said mothy in regard to grape juice for a medicine, be "No longer drink water, but drink a little wine for your stomach's sake." I sometimes think that if we would take as much pains it eating grapes for medicine or medicinal porpoBM um does for coffee we would have surh a demand for M we would hardly have hind enough to produce the «s to supply the demand. |)\v in this paper, as I stated before, I have not written deal, but what I have written I have tried to write ; to the point, and have not tried to write a lot and not t right to the point. If there is anything that is not plain can bring it out by asking questions. El have been asked to write on the subject of "(Trowing Pruning Grapes," the location for the vineyard will In - irst consideration. Eitrary to most authorities on the selection of ground, ild select a high piece sloping to the northwest. Inquiry the air currents, if not already acquainted with them, d be made. After becoming satisfied that tin- ground was free from frost and the soil suitable, preferring day soil and daw award drainage, I would prepare the ground by plowing in the falL If the ground was deficient in fertilizers I would put alniut the same amount of barnyard manure, as to top dressing. hs to grow a fair crop of corn. In the spring when the proi&gt;er time comes for planting, disk and drag the ground until the soil is well pulverized, then take a lister and lay the plot off in rows e;ist and west to the depth of eight to ten inches, ;md twelve feet apart Having the previous fall purchase! the varieties, namely, Yloorc's Eflrl v Oflm obeli's Eflrlv flocl Word^n olflnt t hf*in </seg>

I tie first step in planting is to cover the roots aliout two ea deep with loose soil, and follow with a barrel spray. yiag about a half a pail of water to each root, then giving water time to settle, follow with more dirt, and stamp ly around each vine. Then cultivate as soon as possible. ■i&gt;ing back to the varieties I will five my reason for select- Moore's Early, Campbell's Early, and Worden's. Erst, I select the greatest number of Moore's Early, be - e, on account of their size, even and early ripening, tbej easier picked, easier sold, bring a better price, and if ted properly yield as much as others. I'cond, the Campbell's Early. They are more of an expert t, but from what I have seen I believe they are equal to Moore's Early. Bird, the Wordens, on account of lengthening out the ►n. They do not ripen as evenly as the others or bring uch per basket. Iy reason for planting in rows twelve feet apart is that iint one row of strawberries in the renter of each grape Thus the vines partially shade the strawberries, and for further reason to have room enough to drive a mowing nine, haul fertilizer, and to gather the fruit. I'ter the planting they are kept clean by cultivating with e-tooth cultivator and narrow disk. This is kept up in ■arly part of the summer. Later on I may run the mower it to rat off some few weeds that may have started, but ot approve of late cultivation. Ee next spring I cut the vines bark to about half 1h"ir th, having the summer before let them grow only two Eie trellises are now put in. The first post is slanted in I to save bracing. The rest are set straight with an arm feet long running crossways at the top and are six fret the ground after setting. These posts should be set be- </seg>

After growing a sufficient amount of wood on the grapes. by proper pruning I attempt to grow the right amount of wood to produce a full crop of grapes.

A .Member: Don't you plant any Concord*? Mr. Shaver: No, sir. A Member: Is that due to the market, or have you any other reason for that? Ir. Shaver: It is kecMwe the Concords do not ripen. In ivorable country it is very productive, but here only it one-half of them ripen and the other half are green, they are very bad to drop off the vines. They are not as I as the Moore's Early, which ripen better and come in ier than those shipped in; I have always beea able to ket mine before any others are shipped in. Mr. Harrison: Do you prune in the spring, did you s&amp;y, instead of in the fall ? Mr. Shaver: No, sir, in March. Mr. Harrison : Won't they bleed? Mr. Shaver: No, sir, until the sap starts they won't. I never had any grapes spill back; I don't think I have missed a crop in eleven years, except with some Concords. The Moore's Karly I never have had a failure with. Another Member: Do I understand you to say that yon just left one bad on the spur? Mr. Shaver: I don't leave any spur at all; I keep right up tn the vine so there will be no more growth, I don't intend that there shall be any more growth. Another Memlxr: How do you renew it? Ir. Shaver: That would be the same in growing to the •; when you leave your whole branch it grows off side •, you notice that a big apple on a little stem hangs right ight down; the same is true of the grape, a big bunch is he vine of small growth. You trim just about as close ou can, just as you take a limb off of an apple tree, but quite as close, I take it off, say a quarter of an inch. DISCUSSION. </seg>
            <seg id="p097">97 Another Member I us seventy years old and that is the first time I ever heard of trimming a grape vine. Iiother Member: I dou't won to understand this. Can make a sort of a chart on the blackboard showing how - trim Moore's Early? Kesident Green : I am sorry Mr. Shaver didn't do that be - for it is a fact that he ha.s taken better than $700 worth apes off of an acre and a half each year for the last two ■r. Shaver: I am not very good at drawing but 1 r will show what I mean : There are too many little limbs here (indicating) that will produce. There ; re more than I want to produce the grapes, so when I cut this limb (indicating) there will be no growth of wood and no grapes on that, but this one next to it I will leave the whole length if it don't go beyond the point of space I have. There wasn't so much growth in this stem (indicating) so I cut clear back to here ( indicating) end cut off the old wood when possible so as to stop the growth again. A Member: About how many limbs would you l&lt;-ave &lt;&gt;n the vine? Mr. Shaver: That depends on the age of the vine and its thriftiness; on some vines I might take off half, others I wouldn't take off so much, and on others a little more. In California they put on a certain amount of water to control the growth of wood, but we can't do that here, we have to an* other means.

I haven't very many trees bin her think I have done pretty well for this section of th ■ Member: How have you found the Campbell's Early in uctiveness? K. Shaver: I haven't raised them myself. The bunches to lie a little larger an.l I thought 1 would start live red this spring as an experiment. Mr. Christy: Mr. Shaver's statement in regard to the Concord and Worden, it seems to me that he lias then changi d about, and another tiling the way he trims his Moore's Early. A jrreat many have trouble getting them to set berries at all, and when he trims to one or two buds in the old branch the Moore's Early doesn't set a true bud short of where the second limb comes. Mr. Shaver: I never trim but two buds. Ilteltzer: Mr. Shaver to his Rapport. I hav&lt; i£ all those before they parties want them for is growing old. and I want hi the Concords and I succeed in are ripe, they ripen so uneven jelly hence I tjet them off my IA. Mar-shall: When the Concords ripen uneven it is use they are unhealthy, it is caused by wet weather tlvit es trouble in the stem of the bunch and the same thin-; is Ming the Worden. And there is another trouble with the ■den ; if you trim it as Ion? as the Moore's Early it over - s and can not ripen the fruit. T think it is the best ipial - &gt;f any, but it is more uncertain, it is very perWiable and t po on the market at once. Tt is really at its prime before </seg>
            <seg id="p099">99 it is quite black. There are a good many things that you have to take into consideration, I think in Mr. Shaver's plait- and under those conditions his ideas are all rigkt, Imt generally any man that will slander the Concord will slander his own mother. It is the best grape we have in the United States, take it all over. We eat more pounds in the United Si. than all others put together; we can't afford to turn it down; because we have had so much wet weather that has caused it to ripen uneven; all you have got to do is to spray the Con - cord and it will ripen up even all right. The Moore's Early is a Ix'tter resister to diseases than the others. We noticed this trouble Ant on the Worden, and then it followed up by affecting the Concord, and we sprayed our vineyard. I very easily controlled in our vineyard by spraying. It all the stem of the bunch, and you can always see it on the leaves as well as on the stem. The stem becomes more or less black and the grape starts to get ripe, and some berries will be ripe and some green on the same bunch and it sticks there and stands for days and weeks. President Green: What do you spray with? .Mr. .Marshall: Bordeaux mixture. A Member: 4-4-50? R. Marshall: No, S-S-50. We bad that trouble right , but it did not bother us last year. A Member: What time do you spray? Mr. Marshall: I sat on the fence and interned the other fellows do the spraying, it was done early in th&lt; just after the fruit set, after the blossoms are gone. A Member: How often did you spray? Mr. Marshall : We only gave one thorough spraying. Mr. Shaver: I would like to say a few words about the Concord grape. Generally speaking, everybody calls every - thing a Concord that is black ; when T first commenced to haul grapes to Lincoln everybody thought they were the brightest Concords they ever saw; they won't eat anything but Con - cords, consequently we can't say to them these are not &lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p100">100 rords. Now the real fact of the business is, in niv observation, when von conic right down to the point of ripening, the Con - cord isn't in it only in a few countries. Take Professor Green of Minnesota who has probably had as much experience as anv man in the West. In his work he makes it a point that with Concords you must look out for localities where they ripm or you better not plant them. I know of growers that haul these grapes down to Lincoln to market for 7."&gt; cents a bushel when I am selling at wholesale for 30 cents a basket. This year I got 30 cents a basket for Moore's Early. There are always some green grapes on them. My pickers had to throw them away, especially on the top; I get off about one dose on the market, and they ln'gin to say you have changed your grapes, and 1 say the others arc all gone, the first Con - cords arc all gone. Mr. Marshall : The Worden is ripe before it is fully colored, and the Concord is not for ten days after it is gathered, You want to let the Concords ripen or you will make your custom - ers all mad. I claim that we are in one of the best Concord countries in the West; go around Omaha and it will prove that. Go across into Iowa and they will tell you what they get on the east side of the river. I haven't a thing to say against Moore's Early or Worden: I will admit that the Worden is the best quality when well ripened, but the Con - cord is fully as good as the Moore's Early. The Concord is as reliable as anything we have lint it has that one trouble, but the Worden has the same trouble in our community, we have to watch it the same as the Concord. President Ghfwn: This closes our program this afternoon, but we have the Secretary's and Treasurer's reports, and I want to call attention to the question box. During the read - ing of these reports Mr. Yeager will collect the questions. If therc&gt; is anything you want information on, write it on a slip of paper and Mr. Yeager will collect it and we will have some one answer the questions. We will now listen to the Secretary's report. </seg>
            <seg id="p101">101 The wemmm of 1901) has been one of profit to the horticul - tmists in general. The fruit crop was good iu the greater part of the state. Late frosts injured the blossoms of apples and other fruits in spots throughout the southeastern part of the state, yet many orchards in this section were but slightly injured and bore large crops of fruit. Is apple crop in practically all of the territory west of and Lancaster counties, and in all of the territory of the Platte river was large and of good quality. A er of the larger orchards of the state were thoroughly ed the past season and for the fruit from these orchards prices were received. The fruit from unsprayed rds, while infested quite badly with worms, was com - ively free of scab and other fungous diseases and sold well, owing to the brisk demand for apples during the ?r part of the season. Ivere weather injured the peach buds, and peaches were n only in limited quantities in southeastern Nebraska, yield of strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries was good and the prices received for same held up well, net - those engaged in the growing of these crops snug in - «. Cherries yielded well in some sections and sold for prices. Plums and other fruits not mentioned were up andard both in quantity and quality. The florists report riving business for the year, having had a ready sale for lants and flowers grown at good prices. I tie showing made at the State Fair by the horticulturists le state was encouraging. The space usually devoted to ts was well filled with fruit of good quality. It was re - ked by many who viewed the exhibits that seldom does fruit shown at the Fair have as clean appearance as that bited last season. Worms and fungous diseases were not &gt;e seen except by very close inspection. This was un - btedly due to the fact that our fruit growers are giving SE( liETARY'H KEl'OKT </seg>
            <seg id="p102">102 their fruit better cure and t ulture aud are spraying bmk thoroughly than iu the past. The space devoted to floral displays was crowd**] on account of more florists exhibit ing than for a number of years. However, the plants and flowers were all ■taged in a creditable manner and the showing was very good. The executive board at its July meeting arranged to exhibit raaka fruit at the National Horticultural Congress at « ouucil Blutfs, Iowa, November 15 to 20, 1909. C. H. Barn - ard was secured by the committee to gather the fruit and make the exhibit. Tomorrow morning Mr. Barnard will make a report to the Society on Nebraska's showing at this con- More extensive advertising of the 8ociety and itg work has been attempted recently through the Secretary's office. The newspaper mailing list has been enlarged, and to these papers a digest of each bulletin issued by the Society, consisting of from 200 to 500 words with attractive headings is being mailed. It is thought that more publications will publish this horticultural information when it is "boiled" down in this form than would if they are compelled to publish the whole of the bulletin or take the time to extract certain parts of it. A short letter in the form of a notice telling of the organization, its work, etc., is also being distributed. Many of our annual reports are distributed at farmers' institutes, and one of these notices is inserted in each report. §ing the past year we have added to our membership members ; 36 annual and 8 life. We have lost by death Nebraska's pioneer horticulturists and a charter mem - this Society, J. H. Masters of Otoe county.

Mr. President and Gentlemen: I have watched with a great deal of interest the develop - ment of the Minnesota Society. I used to live in MIbbh and thev ust^d to think thev &lt;*nuldn*t niise anttles in Arinne~ 90 </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 not* any more thau oraagn, but 1 found that they were ship - ping trainloads down to Omaha. There are 3,023 members in their society, probably the largest society in the world. Their collection of fruit was magnificent, fully as good as von have. One reason for the success of that society lies here, that instead of antagonizing any organized societies they are all in harmony, they all gather under the wing of the parent society; every ■caber of a subordinate society must be a member of the parent society. In the first place they spend four days in their sessions of the Horticultural Society. A part of the day the Plant Hreeders" Society have their session for j&gt;erhaps two or three hours, the president of that society steps right in and takes charge; then there will be another meeting of the Horticultural Society, and then give away to the Ladies' Auxiliary, and they have about as bright women then' as anywhere unless you come down to Nebraska and that beats them all a little. So things go off pretty lively: the ladies will spend two or three hours, and then it reverts l»a&lt; k to the Horticultural Society. Then comes the Forestry S(k iety, they come under the wing of the Horticultural So - ciety, too. There is this benefit about these auxiliary socie - ties, or affiliated societies, their reports are all published in the annual report of the Horticultural Society, so that no - body is left out. In this state it has been a pretty hard matter to have our forestry reports published, as we have to dig down in our pockets and dig up $75 to publish them. There is a trans - formation going on in this state of Nebraska, instead of con - fining yourselves to fruit entirely you have to give some at - tention to tree planting and home adornment, and here comes in the Florists Society. And right here I want to suggest that this Nebraska Horticultural Society amalgamate these other societies under their incorporation, and the reports given by these various societies be given in the annual report of this Society. Don't you s«&gt;e that you are getting their sup - port in gathering all those kindred interests, and you are not </seg>

IO^ BOA.. only binding them together in organized enthusiasm and in - stead of having only scores or hundreds 3011 may run up into thousands and BO you will awakcu enthusiasm in the whole state? Every member of a subordinate society must be a member of the Horticultural Society, then these other s&lt;&gt; ties, like the Florists, and others will arrange to have their members pay twenty-five cents apiece. If possible, I wish this matter could be brought up before this Society, and per - haps it is just as well to discuss it. I offer a resolution that this matter be left with this Society and that the other socie - ties cooperate with them in their annual meeting. Perhaps it would be well to fill up the three full days; the Florists want half a day and the other societies want some time. You are getting forestry by piecemeal. Tou are getting the flor - ists' work, but of course the Florists is one society. The Forestry Society is doing good work, and a great deal of bard work. One-quarter of our state Is a desolation, and we want to transform the dollar land up in the sandhills Into better lands, and it can be done, I could show you reports that would astonish you. There are the Kinkaiders up there, we want to help to push them along. Pmove you, Mr. President, that this Society arrange to these other societies cooperate with us in their annual ing, and that the reports of those societies be published ie report of this Society.

President Green : We will now have our question box, and I will ask Mr, Davidson, of Aurora, to tell ua about bis grape crop and the way he harvested it. Mr. Davidson : Mr. President and Gentlemen : I do not claim to be an authority on this line of work at all, I suppose I raised the largest crop of {Trapes this year in Hamilton county, over three tons. I have a little less 1 an acre, and I gave it thorough cultivation. We Ijad a </seg>

They ripened a little later, but were a little larger, and 1 think there is no doubt but that my crop would have been very nearly a failure if I had not used the dust mulch process; and if 1 had depended on the mower to cut down the weeds I would have had very few grapes on ac - count of the extreme drouth. The drouth hit my grapes and dried them up and they fell oil badly. I believe I lost a quar - ter of my crop by drying up and falling off, and I did the very best I could with dust mulch, but it was too extremely hut and dry, I believe, to make a success of it. To make u suc - cess of grapes in this country you must give them thorough cultivation, and a person should hoe out the rows at least twice during the season and should not allow the weeds to grow. I believe when we have excessively wet weather it would be a good idea to furrow through the middle between the rows to give it a good drainage, because I have noticed that if the Tine gets too much water the foliage looks bad and black spots begin to appear on the grapes and the leaves don't look right. This year I intend to have the ground lower in the center so that when the heavy rains come on a part of that water will run off. The grape stands dry weather better than excessively wet weather. A Member: How old are your grapes? Mr. Davidson : They have been out about seven or ei^ht </seg>

You must have the top of the soil thoroughly pulver - ized as hard ground or soil will crack open and dry out in Nebraska. My grapes got ripe when the ground was wet, I had a lot of pickers go in and pick when the ground was wet and the ground became hard and packed, and I did not want it to go into winter quarter* that way. I had this ground thoroughly cultivated after they were through picking, and then I sowed in oats, which I thought would grow and make a covering, but the first hard freeze we had bit them off on the ground and they came up again when this snow came on. A Member: What kind of grapes have you? f Davidson : Mostly Concords, some Clintons, some i'» Early and two or three white kinds. Moore's Early me makes a very small growth. A Member: What do you get for your Concords? Mr. Davidson : I sold them for three cents a pound on the Mr. Harrison: Did they ripen even? Mr. Davidson : Reasonably even. My rows extend north and south and by keeping them well cultivated they ripen quite well. In former years I made a failure by not having them cultivated. When there were weeds among them they didn't ripen nearly as well as they did when under thorough cultivation. Mr. Harrison : How late in the season do you cultivate? Mr. Davidson : I cultivated after I picked this year. A Member : Is there any sand in the soil on those you irrl - gated? Mr. Davidson : No, there is no sand in our soil. t Member: When do you trim your grape vines, In the or in the spring? Mr. Davidson: I am trimming now f January), I am not quite done; last year T didn't trim at all. Member: Are von trimminir now while they are frozen? r. Davidson : Yes, this snowstorm stopped our trimmins. </seg>

E: Davidson : I leave 3 or 4 buds on the new growth, and ve quite a lot of old ones. Two years ago my grapes off and I bad over half a crop in the dormant bud, com - ut the second time. A Member: Do they ever kill down in the winter? I. Davidson : One year they all killed to the ground, ; four years ago. I noticed one thing the year my crop illed to the ground. There happened to be a few vines on the ground that got covered with dirt two or three s deep and those vines were living where the ends were ed. That convinced me that the killing of the grape is l question of drying out. I don't care how much cold is if there is four or five inches of snow I don't see how can dry out. That first heavy freeze we had some of the I grapes killed back two feet. A Member: Do you do much trimming in the summer •eaaon? Br.

A Member: Did they ripen even? Mr. Davidson : Fine, I followed Mr. Shaver's style. 1 Member: Has summer manuring of plants after the had been harvested prevented a succeeding crop of berries? Mr. Davidson : I don't think it would affect it any ; in my opinion it would not prevent a succeeding crop. IP. Atkinson : I have tried both ways; a part of the patch manured in the summer and a part was not manured, I wondered if other people had had that same experience? have gotten to be afraid to summer manure; we found e at least a wonderful crop on that the next year. A Member : Why is it necessary to shade strawberries? f\ Shaver: My experience in growing strawberries has that some years we have an excessive amount of rain, [ can grow more strawberries to let even the weeds grow lan to keep them clean the forepart of the season, until the picking. This is one of the reasons ; if you have no - , the largest strawberries are generally found where it taded. I have seen experiments where they have arti - lly shaded and increased the yield largely. As far as g authorities I do not give much preference; Green ia as far north as Minnesota. I would have had a good y failures unless I had shaded some. Mr. Harrison : You don't mean to say that the grapes keep the wind off? Er. Shaver : I plant my patch and I expect them to pro - the strawberries from the south winds. The berries r larger, but are a little longer in ripening. A Member: If a strawberry plantation is right out on a knoll do you think it needs shelter? Mr. Shaver: Yes, sir. </seg>

We will also have an address by Mr. Dalby of Heatrice on "Horticultural Opportunities for the Tenant Farmer." I don't think there is a man in Nebraska who has more tenant farmers than Mr. Dalby, and he certainly is in a position to take care of this subject. Then we will have an address by Professor Whitten of Columbia, Missouri, on "Recent Advancement in Horticulture." He is about as well posted on horticultural subjects as any man in the West.

Mr. Pence: I move we adjourn. Seconded by Mr. Yeager, and carried. Wednesday, January 19, 1910, 9:00 A.M. The Society reassembled and proceeded with its business as follows: President Green : We will now listen to Mr. D. S. Dalby, of Beatrice, on the subject of "Horticultural Opportunities for the Tenant Farmer." HORTICULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE TENANT FARMER U. S. DAJBY, BEATRICE Mr. President and Members : I feel a little bit out of place in coming before the Horticultural Society and trying to tell them anything that I know that they don't know, and I am very sure that when I am through you will discover that I don't know anything that you don't already know. I come before you as a green farmer and not as a Horticulturist, al - though I am especially interested in horticulture and more especially in the products of horticulture. What I have to say will be more from the standpoint of horticultural oppor - tunities of the green farmer. I think there is nothing so deso - late as a farm without fruit around it. I can not think of any place that is more lonely and forlorn and desolate than a farm without frnit around it. Among our tenant farmers there is not one out of ten that does have fruit, and when Sec - retary Marshall asked me to take up this question I told him that I would start it and let the discussion take care of itself. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">125 Kt presume to make an address so I want von to fed free lime to stop me ami ask any question or to make any stions that come to your mind. The reason win there are not more orchards and fruit rown on the average farms is just as much the landlord's fault as the tenants'. I think in this question of landlord ami tenant that the landlord seed* ju*t as much education as the tenant. In many cases the landlord is no) up on farm ing himself, and in his ignorance he drives ihe tenant to lie a land or soil robber who sometimes skims the land for all then - is in it. When that exists there is no chance for horticulture on that farm. I'nless there is a feeling of thorough under - standing between the landlord and tenant— the landlord tin del-standing the conditions of agriculture thoroughly himself — and the tenant being a capable, honest man that yon want to keep on your land for an indefinite length of time, a man who will make that farm a home for himself, with the idea of treating that land just aa he would if it were his own, there is no chance for horticulture. Bui where that condition doea exist there is no reason why the tenant fanner should not have just as good fruit on that farm as if he owned it himself. I take a pride in makinir the tenant farmers we have, to a man, take as much pride in the farm as if lie owned it himself. 1 don't want any one to drive past one of our farms and say there is a tenant farmer. There is too mm h of that. In the county in which I live — Gage county — it d&lt;x-s not take a prac - ticed eve at all to pick out the tenant fanners, or farms, and that is true with the whole of the United States as a rule. There are unsuccessful landlords as well as unsuccessful ten ants; if a landlord doi'sn't understand the phase of agrirnl - ture himself and isn't liberal minded towards the tenant be can't expert the tenant to he so towards him, and if he isn't that way he won't make that farm look lik&lt; a farm, lint will make it look like the average tenant farm, and th&gt;it is pope - cially true in regard to the horticultural opportimities. The avera**e tenant we will sav after he takes a niece (if </seg>
            <seg id="p126">126 land that has nothing on it but the house-, burn ami buildings necessary to run it, moves on the land and if there is no fruit around him he will say, "Well, I just guess I won't plant any trees on this man's land, I will be doing something for him or for some one else that may follow me.'" I'nless there is some suggestion on the part of the landlord to him, that if hi' makes any outlay lie will not have to lose it. he never will plant any tries or set out any fruit, but then U just the chance for thrm to get together on that question. There are lots of men fann - ing who have Canned the same place for ten or twenty years; I know of a number who have farmed the same farm for ten jean, and I know some of thoae men who haven't as much as a peach tree or a blackberry bush or a strawberry plant on that farm, and just think what they might have had in that length of time. I am going to illustrate what some men have done in our own ease. In the spring of l!&gt;04 we had a nnm that went into a cornfield and built a house and barn in May while I was in Illinois. And when I came back that man, without any suggestion on my part whatever, had set out a complete fruit farm. That is from the giv: i; ten - ant's standpoint. He had planted peaches, strawlxsiies, and blackberries. Different kinds and as much as the avei farmer can care for. That was in the spring of l!)04, and now he has all kinds of fruits, except apples. He has had peach s, cherries, grapes, blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries. He has made a home out of that place, and it is a pleasure in him. He is a farmer who has a family of children, and they fcel towards that farm as though it were a home. There at - other men that could have been on that same place and they would simply have had a big cornfield there yet. From the landlord's standpoint you couldn't hire that man away from us. and we do something, too, to try to balance what he has done. We say to him that we will give him a little more im - provements than we do to the other man, lnn-anse he shows a willingness to do his part, and we are going to help him on our part. Another illustration: Two years ago this man's </seg>
            <seg id="p127">127 brother, ii seems to ran iu the family, wanted to have a place mil went to another place in another part of the county, and went on a farm where thciv wasn't any fruit or anything ex ee]»i ili,- old buiklingg, such as are on the ordinary tenant farm. He baa around him now young trees that will soon be in bearing. lie is going to have a home, and aside from the lollars and ivntu J li.it man w ill save in fruit hills and doctors bills liv having an abundance of fruit on that farm. And bj having fruit on tin* place that is growing he can have the sat- isfaction of having a place that is a home instead of just merely a place to live. And the expense is very trifliiif; in "ctting ruough fruit trees to set oui a small orchard. There is also a chance for the fruit farmer on a large scale, although I think the average man that wants to go into the fruit husiin ss on a large scale would prefer to own his own land. One man 1 know, at least, would not hesitate to use any number of acres of land to get into the commercial fruit business, ami let him put his experience up against the land- ■s land. I don't see why a very profitable arrangement I not be made along that line. Xow in order to aid him to do that comes up the question of the lease, and the more 1 handle farms the less 1 think of a lease. If you hare a good man you don't need a leaise, and if you have a poor man the onlv thing von need a lease for is to get rid of him. I have heard some men say you want to have a copper riveted I or contract, hut as I s;ii«l, if you do have a man and he is honest and industrious and a good farmer you don't need or want a lease with that man; and if you have got a poor man all you need it for is to have it strong enough to tin' him. There is no chance for horticultural opportunities for the tenant farmer who is an annual mover. If a man is jroin the trouble to set out fruit on any man's land he will not do it unless he is assured that he can stay there enough jean Biy for his labor. We have an understanding with our that they are there for life or on srood behavior, find such nderstandins enables us to get a better quality of men. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 As 1 said before, there is as much Mad for education ou the laudlord'K side as there is on the tenant's side. »\- I have intruded on the next man's time with this brief ie and if there are any questions or any discussion to up 1 will be glad to do what I can to help the thing along. I,. ( &gt;. Williams : For how long a term do you make a lease? Mr. Dalby : For five years. Mr. Williams: Do you have a written contract? .Mr. Dalby : We have a written contract, but we do not put that into the lease, that is understood. 1 wouldn't have a man that didn't fed that he would do anything in the world for me. I want them to feel that way towards me. We ask the least of any man. We seed the best tenant*; in our com - munity. If there is a feeling of friendliness between the landlord and tenant the tenant will do a lot of things he wouldn't otherwise do. Mr. Williams: What do you consider an equitable adjust - ment between landlord and tenant? I. Dalby: I figure that if I buy a fruit tree, and we have place* that have nice orchards on them, I encourage And if they thought we wouldn't charge any rent for ind they will take a little better care of the trees and the ts won't eat them so bad. A Member: Don't you find that those who are inclined to plant trees are better tenants and more willing to stay? Mr. Dalby: Yes, that is true. We have one man on our land for ten years, and we haven't planted a thing, not even .i strawberry. They know they can stay there ten years longer if they want 1o because they are good fanners and they fulfil the requirements we ask. We suggest to our men that it would be a nice thing to have fruit there, but outside &lt;&gt;f suggesting we don't go any further. A Member: What do you mean when you say you exempt them from the rent? DISCUSSION. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">129 .Mr. Dalby: We don't charge them for ihe land. The or - chard laud we put that up against their trees. The only c;ish rent is the pasture land. There isn't anything in the lease •boat that and I don't know whether we would get any better results if there was. It is just an understanding we ha\«* with the tenants. The tenants themselves started it. We saw what one or two men could do and we saw what a good thing it was. If they put in an acre or two of small fruit ami returns the next year that land costs them nothing. Hut we haven't hardly got into that yet, as the average corn farmer don't figure that way. If he put in an acre of small fruit it cuts down his acreage for corn. I don't think a fruit farmer could be a very heavy grain farmer. Secretary Marshall: How much do you think a family orchard and windbreak or grove will add to the value of a farm in case it is on the market? Mr. Dalby: If you are selling it to a man to make a home out of it it will make a big difference. Of course, land in Ne - braska is valued according to its productiveness. Land sills in our neighborhood with orchards and good sets of improve - ments for better prices than lands without these impi ments. The good farmers are beginning to figure on that more now than they did before; they begin to talk about whether there is anything started on the farm, and fruit is one of the things that takes time to grow. In addition to the fruit we are growing quite a lot of catalpa trees for fence I Mists on the north side of the house. We have had good - thus far in having them cared for by the man that runs the farm, and he uses them for a windbreak. A Member: Do you plant your trees pretty thick? Ir. Dalby: I planted them 8 feet by 4, 8 feet between the i. I did that so we could drive between the rows to cut the posts. A Member: It seems that if the trees are scattered they don't make posts as well. Mr. Dalby : That is true, I haven't had much experience </seg>

Of course if he plants to peachea it takes a longer time, but these I have mentioned are the kinds of fruits the average farmer would want on his land, and re - sult in getting his boys to help on the place. If I was a hired man I would want to work on a farm that had fruit on it and not on a place where they had only a few scarecrows on the place. If that is all. I thank you for your kind attention. |"esident Green: Are there any further questions that want to ask Mr. Dalby? If there is anything you think ter you can put your questions in the question box and will be taken care of. We have with us Professor J. C. tten, of Columbia, Missouri, who will speak to us on the pet of "Recent Advancement in Horticulture." RECENT ADVANCEMENT IN HORTICULTURE PROF. J. C. WHITTKN, UNIVERSITY OK MISSOVRI Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen : I don't know whether the Nebraska State Horticultural ety has a picture in their minds of hearing something morning that will be particularly new or startling in iculture. I shall not expect to give you anything that is fially new with regard to horticulture. T want to quote Dalby, who has just addressed you, in that respect. Our incement in horticulture did not come by leaps and ids; it is a thing which has had a general progress or rth. It has been said that "There is nothing new under sun." If I could tell you something about the oldest les of horticulture that is the best I can expect to do. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">131 Knie the old, old story," is a good statement. If we ran the old, old story and tell it in terms up to date w ips understand it better. We are dealing essentially in horticulture, with the same subjects and with the same methods as our forefathers did. We tan measure the advancement only as we can add to the growth of the subject in the same way as they added to the generations that preceded them. Horticulture is advancing nevertheless, and rapidly, but it is a fact that it is by gradual accretions, a growth upon those which went before means all the more to my mind and should make us feel all the more respectful for that growth if we could feel that it was some - thing striking, because the strikingly new would necessarily be new enough ; we would not have the long decades which experience has had. Horticulture is advancing in every lie - partment. Take for instance one subject that comes promi - nently to my mind as having been marked by very recent progress — that of spraying. Spraying has now come to he recognized by leading orchardists as a necessary part of the orchard management. Leading fruit growers are coming to realize that it has just as much n necessary part of successful orcharding as is pruning, handling of the soil, or even gath - ering, grading, and properly handling the fruit crop itself. There is probably no other factor connected with orchard management which has had its rise and development in so short a period of time as has spraying. Ee art of grafting and budding has been known and prac - for centuries, yet leading nurserymen and fruit growers till working out new details as to better methods. tuning, likewise, has for centuries been practiced, and yet today we still find the active horticulturist still further nlating and systematizing his methods of prnning, and iapts this work to various varieties, soils, and climatic itions. While methods of destroying noxions insects by means which might be called spraying have for decades been known </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 NKBBASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. in a general way, still spraying orchards on the present scale for insects and fungus diseases may be said to have had it* practically within the last two decades. I compared witli other phases of orchard management, spraying is a new art. While in its primitive form this ;iee is approximately a quarter of a century old, it is so lly being improved and perfected that spraying mixtures methods of five years ago are, for the most part, now uated. tobably never in the history of agriculture have so many been engaged in research and practical experimentation any single agricultural problem, as have been working r experiment stations, in the Department of Agriculture ashington during the last two decades upon subjects re - ; to spraying. A host of workers are now giving attention, for at least a part of their time, to some kind of scientific work which has to do with spraying. Trained botanists are working out the life histories of parasitic fungi in order that we may better know how to combat them, and are also studying the effeets of spray mixtures upon the physiological functions of the plants. Equally skilled entomologists are studying the life histories and feeding habits of insects in order that we may better know when and how to spray for them. They are like - wise engaged in a vigorous consideration of parasites and other enemies of these insects which are sometimes success - fully introduced to hold the insects in control. Chemists are finding out more about the active agents in our spray mix - tures, and are investigating means of neutralizing the caustic effects of spraying compounds not already perfected. The field working horticulturists of almost every experiment sta - tion, and many in the U. S. Department of Agriculture, are carrying on field experiments in order to reduce to commer - cial working practice the application of spraying. The up - to-date orchardist is working vigorously hand in hand with these scientific workers to apply in his own orchard princi- </seg>

Kthis activity in behalf of securing better fruit repre - great progress for the better. As compared with other ractices, it may be said that the progress which has been during the last two decades along the line of spraying een almost phenomenal. Iq the other hand, with the example right within our view le number of leading horticulturists who profit by spray - it is perhaps remarkable to find how many orchardists neglect to spray. I do not know whether it is true in Me - ka, but it is true in Missouri that a large proportion of orchardists either do not spray at all, or else fail to use rijjht mixtures at the right time, and do the work at l»«st imperfectly. Some do not even believe yet that it pays [&gt;ray. It is my purpose not to censure the opinion or position of those who do not spray, but to try, if possible, to encourage them to adopt the practice. It is my belief that one of the irieatest reasons why many orchardists do not spray is be - muse they look to the fruit alone in judging the effects of spraying. Most of them look at a sprayed apple, and per - haps another one not sprayed, but almost as good, and do not stop to consider the effects of spraying upon the growth, rigor, and productiveness of the tree itself. We should re - member, in considering spraying, that the comparative ap - pearance of a sprayed apple and one which is not sprayed can tell, at most, only one-half of the story in favor of spray - ing. It is quite as important that we consider the effect of spraying upon the growth, vigor, and vitality of the tree Itself throughout its life history. Many of the noxious In - sects do not affect the fruit, but feed upon the leaves of the tree. Some of those which mar the fruit, injuring its appear- </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 a nee and salability, also injure the leaves of the tree. Many of our fungous diseases like "apple scab'" or "skin blotch," which attack the fruit and injure its market qualities, also attack the leaves of the trees or their twigs. At times certain fungi may do more damage to the tree direct than to the fruit which is being produced by it. Perhaps a few specific ex - amples may emphasize this point better than can be done in any other way. In my own state during the past three springs, for example, we have had prolonged cold, more or less frosty weal her during the blossoming period of our apple trees. In sections of the state more or less blasting of the flowers at this season has taken place, so that buds here and there fail to set well. The almost unanimous verdict of the onhanlists has 1m-cii that iu sections where apples failed to set, even though there was a full bloom, that the failure has l&gt;een due to the fart that the blossoms were killed by cold, frosty weather. It is my (tpinion that the failure of apple blossoms to set fruit, and the dropping of these small apples shortly after they set lias been due more largely to the presence of ''apple seal&gt;" in the orchard than to cold weather. In one large or - chard adjacent tit the experiment station, which is not sprayed, the blossoms of the trees were found to be quite gen - erally affected with "apple scab." The stem of the flower or i&gt;eduncle in many cases turned black, wilted, then with - ered, and the ttower fell because the parasitic fungi, "apple scab." had a foothold in the Bower cluster, and not directly became the weather was cold enough to kill the blooms through frost. Similar observation has been made in many orchards in various sections of the state. This withering and destruction of the blossoms after a cold night is now usually thought by the orchardists to be due to the cold, when, how - ever, the flower clusters are seen to be generally affected with scab fungus; the leaves of the trees shrivel and are injured greatly by this same fungus. The indication is that the fun - gus disease has much to do with the killing of the flowers. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">135 I;ain, when sprayed trees are compared with unsprayed right in the same orchard, where all experienced the ! cold weather, lower clusters are mainly killed on trees are not sprayed, and apples that are sprayed escape the and subsequently mature, and because the "apple scab" is kept out of the trees. This is still better evidence that not the cold weather, but the "apple scab"' that killed the n where spraying was not done. In our experiment station orchard during the present season, a full crop of .Jonathan, Bca Davis, Gano, Ingram, Wiuesap, and other leading commercial varieties was secured on trees which went through the same cold weather as was experienced by adjacent uusprayed tree* whose bloosoms or young fruit was mostly killed before the warm weather of spring came on. Some of the orchardists said that it was not worth while to Wfnj, because the cold weather had killed all of the blos - soms; and he had nothing to spray for. An outlaying experi - ment was performed on an adjacent orchard. This on-hard embraces sonic UUO acres of .Jonathan, l!en Davis, Gano, and other commercial sorts. Relieving from the previous year'-; observations that the loss of the flowers was due to "scab" rather than to cold weather, a single acre in this orchard was sprayed carefully l&gt;y the experiment station. This one acre had more good marketable fruit on it during this autumn than has all of the rest of the 2M acres combined. While the cold weather was apparently killing the blossoms on nnaprayed trees (which blossoms, however, were actually being killed by "apple scab"), fruit was setting nicely on sprayed trees where "apple scab" was kept down, and a good crop was the result. It should be further emphasized that very much of the alleged killing of apple blossoms in cold weather, rainy springs, and frosty weather is more largely due to "apple scab" in most localities than to cold wet weather. In order to impress this point better upon the mind, it </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 Ed be remembered that "apple scab" is known by the list to make its best development oil the trees during wet, inclement weather. These are the conditions when ives best. &lt; &gt;n the other hand, during such weather the tree is not mak - ing rapid or vigorous growth. It is at a standstill on account of cold weftther preventing its normal functions of growth. It has about all it can do, if kept in perfect health, to hold its owu during seven- inclement weather. The "apple scab" then is favored in its development; it is enabled to get a strong foothold on the leaves and flower clusters to -devitalize the uee, by injuring the tree and almost entirely destroying the (lowers and young fruit by attacking them and preventing their development. observations in our experiment station orchard, during several past cold springs, indicate that *prin&lt;; frosts somewhat rarely kill the flowers if they are kept in good health. Apple blossoms in our experiment station orchard, when fully opened, have passed safely through a temperature of L'T degrees I\. or ."&gt; degrees below the actual freezing point of water, during a frosty night and still set enough fruit for a full crop, where kept free from "scab" by spraying. In the spring of 190S. some of our trees actually passed through ;i temperature which for a period of about one hour toward morning went as low as 20 degrees F., in the orchard, or 6 degrees below the freezing point of water, and still had a fair crop of fruit set. Blossoms which are not fully open may probably pass through even a lower temperature than this, if not too prolonged, and still set fruit, if the trees are in healthy condition. In our section, I would regard, ordin - arily, a temperature of 26 degrees as being the critical point below which it is not safe for apple flowers in full blossom to pass, but under ordinary conditions I would regard any temperature above 26 degrees as not being necessarily fatal to apple flowers in full blossom. In fact, they will usually endure a temperature not lower than 26 degrees without anything like the full crop of flowers being killed. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 Another point which needs emphasis in view of spraying for the good of the tree itself, is the fact that we may keep the leaves in good health and enable the tree to carry the leaves through autumn up to cold weather in early winter. Again, 1 do not kiiow whether your apple trees in unsprayed orchards customarily shed their leaves, or have the leaves lose their green in late summer or early autumn. With us it peaenllj happens, however, that unsprayed orchards fail to hold their leaves late enough. Even before the crop of fruit is gathered, if there is a crop of fruit, the leaves on the trees begin to fall, or prematurely lose their green color, look - ing dull and sickly. In some unsprayed orchards, some years, 1 have seen the trees almost bare before time to gather the fruit iu the fall, and have seen at least fair crops of fruit harvested from trees whose leaves were all shed at the time the apples were picked. This is a condition of affairs which very seriously hinders the setting of a crop of fruit buds for I he subsequent season. I should be borne in mind that the blossom buds on an e tree form during the summer and autumn previous le spring when they blossom and set fruit. At least as f as June in our state, and I presume also in yours, the its for next year may be found to be forming down in the t buds of the apple tree. Thousands of sections of fruit i by microscopic exauiination made by us during the last years show that these fruit buds continue to grow and •lop throughout most of the summer and the autumn. &gt;rder to protect them, it is necessary that the trees have n, healthy, vigorous foliage in order that these buds for following spring may be developed and matured. It is also important that the apple trees retain vigorous, green foliage throughout the season in order that plant food, largely in the form of starch, may be abundantly stored up in the buds and twigs and crowns of the tree to start it into growth the following spring and get it rigorous enough that its blossoms can set fruit. Where the leaves are shed prema- </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 NEBRASKA STATE IIOUTlcri/Tl'KAL SOCIETY. uirely early in late summer or early autumn, the plant food fails properly to develop for the following spring. If they come out into blossom al all the blOMOOM will be weak so lliat they may fall without setting fruit, and if the tree has Called during the previous summer ami autumn to store up the proper plant fond supply, it is not apt to give the blossoms Hit food material which is necessary to stand low temperature or wet weather, and set fruit during llie spring. In such - we may have a weak blossom and yet fail to set fruit. It is a notable fact that property sprayed orchards carry the leaves vigorous and green up to early autumn and winter, while unsprayed trees have shed their leaves too early for the proper food supply in the tree. In our own state the past uar l&gt;en Davis applet in sprayed orchards generally set a good crop ami matured a good crop of fruit. In unsprayed orchards it was the complaint of the fruit growers that they had no blossoms or that they had very little blossoms in the spring, and what few came out looked small, weak, and un - developed. As a result, they had no fruit crop to spray for, and it did not pay to ■pray, while as a matter of fact this was the hest evidence possible that spraying should have been peiformed in order that the trees might have had the necessary energy to make flowers and set fruit. Another example comes to my mind which tends to indicate why some orchardists do not spray. In my own state a leading orchardist who sprays has a very productive and profitable orchard, -lust across the road from him, on similar land, another orchardist has an apple orchard of similar size and age. The latter does not spray. During the World's Fair at St. Louis, the writer had occasion to visit these orchards when the apple crops were maturing. He drove along the road between the two orchards in company with the two owners. The gentleman who does not spray re - marked : "Well I do not spray, the other man does, now look at my orchard and see if it does not look just about as well as the one that is sprayed." Strange to say, it did appear </seg>
            <seg id="p139">139 from t lie road to have about as good a crop of apples as the adjacent orchard. Closer examination, however, showed that from the road the fruit showed up better than it actually was in the unsprayed orchard. Most of the leaves had dropepd from the trees and those that remained were dying and wilt - ing, and this gave opportunity for what fruit there was to shine out more vividly than did the apples on the rich green, foliage trees of the sprayed orchard. A search for show fruit, however, showed that on the trees in the sprayed orchard splendid show specimens could be secured. Search for show sjMiiiiicns in the unsprayed orchard revealed the fact that upon close examination almost every apple was more or lea affected with ".scab" or "curculio'' or by "codling moth" or other insects and diseases. Hardly a show specimen could be found in an orchard, that from the road looked to be carrying a good crop of fruit. The gentleman who owned the sprayed orchard took the first prize in his own state for the best Yolk Imperial and Gano apples. His neighbor who did not spray did not take a single premium of any kind for a single variety. The fruit was judged side by side by men who knew nothing of the orchards and nothing of the care that was given the orchards, or why the fruil in one case was superior to the When buyers examined the fruit of these two orchards, tht - orchardist who sprayed had fruit which nearly all went into bands, and a very small per cent of culls left. The orchardist who did not spray found one-half of his fruit sorted out as culls, and the other half could not compare in quality to the crop of his neighbor who sprayed. II is impossible, then, by casual observation from a distance ass by an orchard and form a correct opinion as to whether fruit in it has profited by spraying or whether it has not. iwas not my purpose to go into the details of when and to spray apples. Tonr own state experiment station baa out excellent bulletins giving instructions along this The Department of Agriculture at Washington, D. C, been equally active in sending out similar publications. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 Iiy man wlict contemplates spraying should get the bulle - of this station and of the Department of Agriculture at tiington, ami should read them very carefully for instruc - s that are adapted to conditions in his particular state. There is another phase, that of horticultural organization. We have had for a long time organizations that gather 1 1 1 • statistics-. For instance, there is the American Po«O - al Society, and societies like your own that gather up statistics and put them on record, so that we bfCOBM posted on much of the work that is being done, and shows the pro - ■ of the science and what ought to be done. In recent years there have been formed organizations for packing, Marketing, shipping, and handling the product, and protecting the market. In our own state when the strawberry interests ■tatted, two decades ago, they were without organization and the producer did not make enough; another man would he lucky, he would strike an honest commission man and get something out of his fruit; another man knew when he waked up tomorrow morning that be had not only lost his fruit but had got nothing back to pay for the freight. In recent yean they have organized, they have oversight over the methods of packing. A man has a place for his strawberries so they can be crated and they will not be shipped until they are crated. Again they are organized so they can have oversight over who the buyers are. They can sell them on track so they may know who the men are that they deal with. They • an employ a man in charge of their organization who knows the markets, and knows where strawberries are plentiful and where they are needed and where they were marketed. Again in the far Northwest you see the results of organiza - tion. Apples from the Hood River District are sold in other sections for much higher prices than growers nearer the big markets receive, because the Northwestern growers have done something that growers nearer the market have not done: they have organized and created a demand, and it gives them a definite brand of goods and when they sell them on the </seg>
            <seg id="p141">141 market the- buyer knows what the goods art' going to be, and it enables them to market the fruit much easier. 1 under - stand that in some of these districts not more than 20 per cent or l'."&gt; per cent of the fruit will reach the grade that will pan the supervisors of that orgaMiatioB, but they will make more out of the I'O per cent or 2."&gt; per cent packed and graded aud given a standard brand than they could make out of their whole crop if it were in barrels and sold on the market without being graded. There is another tiling I wish to sj&gt;eak of, that of the citrous industry of ( alifornia, because it is so remote from the market. They have an organisation for the packing, marking, shipping, and handling their fruits. Florida grows a better orange than can lie grown on the Pacific coast, — that is well recognized. — yet the Florida growers have been almost driven out of the market trying to compete with the California fruit, simply because they haven't had an organization, while in California their organization has long been perfected. There is room for both, yet Florida with its better fruit never has been able to get as much money for its fruit as the California people with their organization. There is another factor, that of cooling and refrigeration, and shipping in refrigerator cars. And the storing of fruit during the winter is another thing that we must not lose sight of. And the fruit that ripens in the fall is held so that it can be sold throughout the whole year. Tn my judgment we are going to see a means perfected, whereby that portion of our crop of apples capable of being held in storage until needed and then taken out from time to time so that \\&lt;* will not have to be without fruit the large part of the year but can market it during nny season of the year. Bethods of certifying fruit products and making it more ing is another factor that should be mentioned. T can not thinking, from the waking up that is occurring, that we &gt;n the eve of greater developments in fruit growing. We </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 have not in this country reached anything like the limit of our possibilities of the high price for first class fruit. 1 tan not help but be interested in the German aud French people and the markets of Europe. If we think that $1."&gt; ■ box which they have gotten for their fruit is high, for some of the northwestern grown apples $6 to $8 a basket is still higher in proportion. Let us see what can be done in London. Some sell for such prices that they get M cents and 73 cents apiece for a single apple of a fancy grade. And to show you the diffewee between the money that can be made out of the beat grade of fruit properly packed and the jworer grade im - properly packed, I give you the igVCi from one German grower of fancy apples. His beat grade from his orchard of Bl trees averaged in weight something like ■"■', of a pound, and his fourth grade averaged just about one-half as large as his highest grade apples. His highest grade netted him for a jK-riod of years 72 cents apiece in our money in the markets of Paris, Berlin, and London, while his fourth grade apples averaging in weight less than half a pound brought him a fraction below 5 cents apiece. The apples weighing one-half as much brought bin one- fourteenth as much in price. Two of the fourth (trade contained the same weight as the highest grade and those two apples brought 10 cents or a fraction less, while one of the highest grade weighing as much as the two of the fourth grade brought 72 cents. Those people have worked up the sale of the highest grade apples to a price we never dreamed of getting in this country. Who are the buyers of these apples? Most of them go to the American tourists, the most particular people on the lace of the earth. They will pav 75 cents for an apple and thoK same people will come back home and expect to pay 75 cents a box for them. Why? Because these people have learned that if they can get a perfectly beautiful luxury they want it, and they want it in this country too. I was down in West Virginia about a month ago in one of the leading fruit districts. In a section where oil, and coal </seg>
            <seg id="p143">143 ■lining interests abound and when- their advantages are rather nixed. 1 found men there whom I had visited some irs jiijo and who tlien were marketing their apples in barrels. They are now shipping from 1*0 per cent to 25 per cent of their best fruit through an organisation. Thej are selling this fruit in 10 poond boxes and thi* Tear this fruit in 1" run from ?7 to fti a liox. They are shipix-d to the larfB markets. In the last S years they have worked up a demand for that fine class of fruit, so that this year about 26 per &lt; &lt;nt of their fruit went into thai class of packages. They had the other 75 per cent of their fruit to pat in barrels anil just about as much for it after they had taken out tftj per cent of the highest grade as for the whole of it before. They said they had no trouble to market the highest gradr and could have sol-! it all ar the highest price if they had had the fruit of that grade, and that they made more money out of one-(]narter of their crop marketed in that way than if they had marketed the whole prop in barrels. Another thing that was new to me; they said that when they took out that best grade of fruit they could get about the same price for it as they could have if the best fruit was in bands, because the uniformity in size is more essential than the rise. Apples to sell well should be uniform in size and in a box of apples unless they are graded the big ones spoil the uniformity. In other words if a barrel has one big apple and the others smaller the} don't look bo well, — it is the uniformity in that makes them sell. I side from the methods of organization and shipping I t to mention another thing; any recent advancement in ieulture is due to the fruit grower himself. He has nod what to do for the first tine, and he has learned that tree is a thing of life, a living thing. I don't think we emphasize that point too much. If you take the fruit :s and journals yon will find that the further back you go more the fruit grower had a definite plan and skel&gt; the shape of his tree, to secure uniformity of the lii </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 His conception was to make it just a mechanical struct ur&lt; : In- wanted it to be just that shape regardless of its habits and life history; he had to shape it just to that idea, just . carpeater would put iu Hi inch studding just that far apart in a house, and he would have to work to that scheme just as much as the carpenter, instead of considering it a tiring organism. You will find that idea is being departed from in the conception of the practical fruit grower, llis idea is now to look at that tree as a living tree which has a shape of its dwi; and the idea I wish to convey to you is that that tre&lt;- ta a living plastic organism, that is capable of being made different, and whenever you do anything to it the tree itself does something back in response. It is a living thing that is teaching you how it should Ik- shaped. For example, I went through an orchard, and in going into his orchard, — he was a practical fruit grower and he studied the individuality of ea&lt; h tree, — each had a certain individual expression just as one horse has from another. You know their eccentricities in their character. This man &lt;onld go into his orchard and look at a tret 1 and tell just how old it was; he could look on the limbs and tell what the year's growth had been and just how it had been behaving from year to year; he could look over the buds and see whether the tree was likely to produce the next spring, — whether the bud would develop or not ; he could tell whether it was improving in nourishment; he could tell about the condition the tree is in or had been for the last 10 years, by the characteristics of its twigs; he could read its life history and consequently reach the right conclusion as to what effect each year's treatment had upon its develop - ment and fruitfulness. Instead of regarding the tree dead structure he is giving attention to the records of a liv - ing thing whose life history he is reading by the character - istics on its twigs. nisrrssiON. President Green : If there are any questions you would like to ask Professor Whitten I am sure he will answer them. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">145 I. Williams: Iu the matter of spraying to prevent in - from very late frosts, I don't understand whether that it WM occasioned by the spraying that spring or mm, es the tree become hardier, or does the spraying of it season cause it to resist the freezing weather? Prof. Whitten : Both are true. I think more directly, the first spring spraying you give it just before the blossoms open is more beneficial than when they are in bloom because it keeps the fungns from growing iu the flowers at that time; on the other hand, spraying on through the season makes the foliage better and it stays on the trees later iu the autumn and makes them hardier. You will find that a tree has more nourishment held in solution when it holds its leaves well on into the winter. I thinl: you can see that if a tree sheds it&lt; leaves earlier it can not store up plant food. You get, so to speak, a thicker cell sap. f'lear water freezes quickly, but a little salt will check it. The more a tree takes on of the (ell sap the greater cold it can withstand. That freezing effect injures these cells in the early spring and the earlier the tree sheds its leaves the less will he its capacity to with - stand the cold. If you go to making laboratory experiments to show the difference between spraying and not spraying trees you will find it is related to the time just preceding the opening of the blossoms. And by holding the leaves on the trees late in the season, stronger buds arc developed. Last winter the Alberta peaches had been pruned back enough to make them grow more luxuriously and in giving them better care through the season to keep them in growth up to autumn they stood 13 degrees more cold than those that shed their leaves earlier. In some degree that is true of the apples. They will also stand more cold if they are in a vigorous grow - ing condition late and still ripen for winter. Professor Anderson has made some experiments to enable him to - how late he could keep the leaves on the trees, and he found that by keeping the leaves healthy during the summer that </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 Mr. Harrison: I think the Professor lias emphasized the fa«t that the (armem want cleaner orchards, Imt I think the fanners should learn that the very best tree* are oftener the homeliest. The strongest tree and the best tree is the one that holds its leaves the longest. We know if the orchard is al - lowed to grow up to jrrass and we have a late dry fall th«&gt; trees will he liable to shed their leaves earlier. If they ha\e late cultivation they will hold their leaves longer. 1'rofessor Whitten: I would not like to recommend late cultivation of jn-aches for this far North. You had better talk with Professor Kmerson aliont that. Yon have to know the trees and he knows your own varieties up here better than 1 do. From our experience where we have milder winters our peaches can stand a lower winter temperature when they have &lt;jrowu well up towards winter. They want to have just as late a dormant period as they can. They reach a sta^e when they are ready to waken up and we should then apply the heat, the earlier they shed their leaves in the summer the quicker they will become dormant and the quicker they will start in the spring. That is another reason why we say it is advisable to ROW them late in the season. A Member : Row would it do to cut off the tops? Prof. Whitten : We do that on the peaches I Member: What have been your observations of spray - to enable apple trees to withstand the drouth? In see - s that Buffered from drouth like last August, what ad - ape is there in spravinj; the orchards? |*of. Whitten: Let me take one instance; just outside station there is a 200 acre orchard; the owner did not y his trees and the late frost killed the blossoms. We into that 200 a&lt;re orchard and sprayed one acre, that sriven otherwise identically the same treatment as the r 190 acres. That ninn has one of the best orchards n&lt;i there, but he did not believe in spraying. The 199 I shed their leaves very early and they were burnt and ad; the one acre was rich in foliage and went into the er in good condition. That one acre had more marketable </seg>
            <seg id="p147">147 Kon it than all of the other 199 acres combined, and that is going to come to Lincoln to get sonic of your Cnsh- Spraying outfits and commence spraying. That one stood the drouth better than the other 10!) acres did. Mr. Christy: Is there anything new on spraying for the eurcnlio in the apple? Prof. Whitten : The first spraying helps if you use arsci of lead. In poach tree spraying for the curculio you are al - most sure to get rid of it. and the brown rot can be controlled almost to the same degree as ctircnlio; the entrance of the fungus into the fruit is effected through punctures, ami we find that if we can spray well enough to prevent punctures we can control the brown rot very largely when we are con - trol ing the curculio. tident Green: I am sure we have listened to a very ting and instructive talk from Professor Whitten for we thank him.

Mr. Bdtaer: 1 have here a little two leafed pamphlet that is recommended iu this country, on the development of fruit trees. Last summer L was out iu the country ami a Swede man took me out in his orchard to look at some trees that had this paint on that is here advertised and is manufactured iu Mr. Yager's city. 1 looked at those trees. A few he had painted, and they were absolutely beauties. About two months ago I was out at the same man's place writing some in - surance for him and the agent came and wanted me to buy three or four bo\es to use lie claims it does away largely with spraying. Now if it is a good thing 1 say it ought to In - pushed and I am going to get some myself and try tht periment. I want some information as to whether auy one has an idea that you can use this prepared paint. Mr. Yager: I haven't anything to do with this paint business and I am not agent for it. Some time ago 1 was called in by these people that they might consult with me They tried to get me to recommend ii, but I could not do that without knowing something about it. They are making some sort of a dope up there that they t -laim will take the place of spraying, but when they told me that, I knew it was pretty much of the nature of a fake. In-cause up to date from the literature I have read on that subject I know that if there was anything of that kind discovered in this country we would all know about it. I don't believe there is anything manufac - tured in our town or any place else, that will take the plan* of scientific spraying. Kesident Green .

Williams: 1 want to ask whether the minutes of the annual meeting, provided for in our Constitution, have read and approved by this or any other meeting? 1'resident Green : Sure, any business that was transacted at the last winter meeting should have been read and ap - proved at that meeting. The same members and the same officers do not get back into open meeting again, and if it had been necessary for them to have been approved they should have been at that time and during that session. Mr. BelUer: We have an organization like this in our county and the minutes of each meeting are read and approved or disapproved at the meeting the next year. Rr. Williams: What minutes were made of this meeting year and when we met this year should have been read , when we opened our meeting. ir. Brown: 1 can tell you what the former practice of Society was.

Mr. Harrison : Wouldn't it be a good idea to have the minutes read at the morning session the next day and then we will know what occurred yesterday and if there is any thing neglected we can rectify it then? Mr. Christy: There are a few of us that can tell what was done. Mr. IJeltzer: In case committee's were appointed at last year's meeting when the report is read it shows what the eoauaittee was appointed for and what their duties were and that rej&gt;ort brings out a report of the doings of that committee. The way it is going on here now it is as Mr. Christy says, we might hate some important committees ap - pointed and wouldn't get their report; it takes but a little while to read that portion of the record that pertains to the business transacted at the opening of the meeting. L. O. Williams : I had in mind, and the reason I called up the matter, there was a committee appointed last year referring to a certain matter, for instance, our legislation committee.

CHAIRMAN Mr. President, and Gentlemen: The Society decided tit last summer's meeting that we ronld tint afford to l&lt; [ tint Congress pass over without having U exhibit there. \\ e felt tliiit we would have to spend a good de;il of money there and on the other hand we did not want to s]»-nd so much. So Anally sl'OO was set aside and it was left to the Board of Directors to use its judgment how to proceed with the exhibit, and whether we should set aside more money at the September meeting. We finally decided to set aride |300 for that purpose ami appointed a committee of thnv to look after this exhibit. This committee was Mr. P.rown Mr. Christy and myself and we engaged Mr. 1 laniard to gather up this exhibit and take care of it. He gathered up the exhibit and installed it, with the help of our Secretary in the latter part of the work. The largest entry was for the best State Horticultural Society exhibit. We won that prize, which is this cup here (indicating). By the way, the base of it is down at the University. The next prize won was this gold medal (indicating) for the most artistic display. The next prize was this cup (indicating). We got that for the best ORES8 AT COUNCIL BLUFFS, IA. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 home orchard collection. We feel pretty good over what Mr. Barnard did for us, or rather what he and our Secretary did for us. We were iu competition with North Carolina, Mary - land, Virginia, Texas and Iowa, and we came home with this cup (indicating). On state exhibits Iowa won the first prize and Nebraska the second, and Washington, Maryland, Idaho followed along. And I will say of Mr. Barnard and our £ retary, — we ought to be very proud of them. We will have to give them the credit for this gold medal, beeMM an.v one could have won that prize if they had laid out the design and put up the fruit. Our boys simply took Jonathan applet, and wrote the word Nebraska on one of those large tables ami then surrounded the Jonathans with Grimes Golden and Northwestern Greenings, and they may well fed proud of their work. We got a great big red feather in our cap over Idaho, Washington, and California. The committee told the boys to gather a good many Grimes Golden and Jonathan apples and kept up the Nebraska record by letting no one go away hungry. We kept giving them out and that had the right effect. At the end when we came to gather up the apples and sell them our apples went at $2 a box just as readily as any in the hall ; wo sold all we could spare and could have sold a good many more, I think we had the advantage over the Western states. Mr. Williams : I heard that the Towa men were asking $3 a box for their apples? Mr. Marshall : I think we could have gotten |3 for ours if we had asked it. We didn't ask it. Apples that stood in that hot room 7 or 8 days were not in first class condition any 5'. ; the room that the fruit was in was warm and we felt $2 a box was not too much.

XKMAIIA, PAWNEE, AND RICHARD- SON COUNTIES. I.eginning with the strawberry, the first fruit to ilpea, the crap was very short but the high price helped considerable on receipts. The short crop was caused by the dry weather in 1908, causing a very poor stand of plants. Late frosts also added to the shortage. Raspberries were seriously dUMged by anthracnose and winter killing and the crop was light. Blackberries did better, but a light cane growth in 1908 pre - vented the possibility of a good crop. Cherries were abun - dant, and very fine. The cherry crop was better than it has Ixvn for several years. The ravages of the shothole fungus I few years ago killing a great part of the cherry trees is the only thing that prevented an over production of cherries this year. Pears were badly hit by a late frost and a very light crop resulted. Prices were $2 per bushel. There were only a few seedling peaches of very poor quality, selling at 50 cents to fl per bushel.

We had an aver - age crop of grapes and more than an average crop of apples. We didn't have an average crop of patches as it was too cold in the winter and anyway we haven't a very good peach country up there. Our quality of fruit was above the average. The apple orchards that were cared for produced very good fruit. I think there was something like 200 carloads of apples sent out of the county I live in. I don't know how much there was sent out of the other counties. The little town of Arlington sent out about 50 cars and we have only 2 or 3 commercial orchards.

Most of our farmers till drifting in the old way, expecting that because in an day they were immune from insect enemies and fungons ses, they will continue immune. The month of June and the very earlv days of July were </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 Eally wet. Weather of this character leads to prevalence igus diseases. These diseases affected all orchards that not thoroughly sprayed and coupled with the severe ht lasting from July 7 until into September, caused uit in many orchard* to he small and caused quite a itage to drop from lack of needed moisture. Cherries were fairly good crop, peaches about one- fourth. grapes where properly sprayed were best crop in years, hut where not sprayed were subject to some fungus diseases and in some vineyards as much as half. The E. T. Hartley or - chard north of Lincoln has been leased for a term of years to &lt; 'has. Dickinson and very favorable crop is reported. Mr. Dickinson did a great amount of pruning in the orchard in the winter of 1908-09, orchard was sprayed 3 times with following result: expense of lease, pruning, spraying, pick - ing, cost of barrels in which to pack and deliver the 5,500 barrels in town was little over $6,000. His fruit, therefore, cost him a little over $1.20 per barrel, 70 per cent of the fruit sold for $2.50 to $3.50 per barrel and a portion of the crop yet on hand is doubtless worth $4 a barrel, returning to Mr. Dickinson a very handsome and substantial profit of about $100 per acre, over and above all expenses of lease and management.

I can speak more especially for Hamilton county, although I know Reward county crop was quite good. There were a great many apples and some were shipped to New York, some - thing that hasn't happened for a number of years. Taken as a whole we had the best we ever raised. I think the apple belt is moving West. I believe the center of the commercial orchards will be found in Hamilton county at the present time. The dry hot weather in August hurt our apple orchards, especially where they were not cultivated, but where they were cultivated they stood the dry hot spell very well. Our peach crop was another failure, outside of the seodli Some of those were of a good grade. I think there is no doubt but we had the best grape crop we ever had. They were of a good grade and we got good prices. In regard to the straw - berries there are some grown but there are very few specializ - ing in strawberries. The crop does not cut much of a figure with us. Now for myself, I had about half a crop of currants ; I have about a quarter of an acre of currants and I think I had a good half crop.

Last fall a gentleman from one of the eastern counties of Iowa said to me that he saw more apples in one orchard in Holt county than there was in his whole county in Iowa. I received a letter recently from a geatlc man who is now in York this state, who has a farm in this county, which is his home. He writes in regard to his orchard here, " I much wish you could have seen my fruit trees and small fruit last summer; I think I could have shown you something worthy of your notice; I am well pleased with my efforts so far with almost all kinds of fruits; T have tried both large and small." This man's farm is right in the sandhill region. I visited his place a few years ago and was surprised at the wonderful growth his trees had made; they had not come into bearing yet not being old enough, but the prospect was good for a very productive orchard. I have in some of my reports referred to Mr. Peter Greelv whose orchard of fif- teen acres has brought him from a thousand to fifteen hun - dred dollars annually for a number of years. A farmer near Chambers sold four hundred dollars worth of apples in one year from four acres. I might multiply instances of sue fnl fruit growing in this district, but this is sufficient to show what can be done by proj&gt;er management. Some years ago an honored member of our society and a leader in horticul - tural instruction in the state visited the Chambers Experi ment Station and was looking over a young orchard, heinsr asked what he thought of the prospect as compared with an orchard in a certain other locality, casting up his eyes and looking over the orchard, said : "I see some brush." Last </seg>
            <seg id="p163">163 ■ that brush produced twelve and one-half bushels to a of very tine fruit. One of the trees produced an apple uring thirteen and one-half inches in circumference. Save spoken of the successes in fruit production in this ct. I might mention many failures; these failures have mainly because of a lack of care and proper manage - which will result in failure anywhere. SU.MK METHODS RESULTING SUCCESSFULLY IN THIS DISTRICT. While in some cases fruit of various kinds have been pro - duced within the bounds of this district in spite of bad treat - ment, yet not in such quantity and quality that it could be called successful fruit raising. There are some things which can not be omitted if we expect full crops of good fruit. Iliile most of the land in north central Nebraska will \ fruit trees to l&gt;earing age with but little or no fertiliz - yet when the age of fruit bearing arrives they require ■ plant food than is found in the soil of most localities in region. SPRAYING Ie tind that the insect enemies of fruit trees and of fruit ifest their presence very soon after the trees come into ing so that spraying is indispensable. Our method has to spray once soon after the petals fall with pyrox, using ther coarse spray with all the force we can give it and rating twice in July and once in August, being careful ove all the earth clear up to the body of the trees. In way we virtually protect all our fruit from worms. Our en folks have only found five wormy apples in all that families have used (about 24 bushels'). CULTIVATION. The best results seem to be obtained in this part of the state, especially on level and sandy land, by plowing under FKKTIMZING. </seg>

And the disk with the common drag continuing the clean cultivation until about the first of August. Then sow a cover crop, or let the wceda grow. Boom* have seeded their orchard! to clover, but the clean cultivation seems to produce the best results. VAIUKTIF.S There were exhibited at the Chambers fair last fall about forty-five kinds of apples besides pears, plums, and peaches. If a list of the varieties which will do well in this district were made it would be much longer than has been generally supposed. I would advise orchard planters, however, not to plant too many kinds and but few summer apple*. The Yel - low Transparent and Duchess for summer, the Wealthy and Maiden's Blush for autumn, the Genet, Hen Davis, N. \V. Greening, Winesap, and Roman Stem for winter. This lat - ter kind in this district keeps well until after the holidays and it yields a crop annually. I have confined my report to the apple this year because it is the most important of all the fruits. Perhaps another year I will report on other fruits. All of which is respectfully submitted. J. L. Coppoo. Director. REPORT FROM DISTRICT NO. 11. COMPRISING M'KK.YI.O AND HAM. COUNTIES. Our district is not considered as a very good fruit district. Nevertheless, last year was a very favorable year for different kinds of fruit. It would have been a little better if the frost had held off a little longer. We had a short crop of apples, but I l&gt;elieve in the general results we have done a little bet - ter than the average for our district.

COMPRISING FRONTIER, (iOSl'KK, KKI&gt; WILLOW. AND FURNAS COUNTIES. Our fruit crop in this district was very light this year ow - ing to frost in the spring. It caught most all of the peaches except a few of the Russell and Crosby. The cherry crop wa» just fair, not a full crop. Apples, owing to dry weather through July and August, were pretty small. The best vari - eties were litter's Bed, Yellow Transparent, Whitney, and Genet. On account of spring frosts and dry weather in the summer the crop was shortened considerably. The plum crop was injured more by drouth than from any other cause, making the fruit very small. 8. C. Kino, Director. REPORT FROM DISTRICT NO. 17. COMPRISING CHERRY COUNTY. Apples were a fair crop where on low land and ground water near. Plums were also a good crop. Cherries and plums were good on high dry land where cultivated and also a few apples in such places. The growing season was a dry one and hail storms were numerous. The recommended list of fruits for this district is good from my observation. However, I would take from it the Virginia Crab. It is a good grower but too shy a bearer. C. M. VanMetrk, Director. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 KKPOliT FROM SAXDOZ EXPERIMENT STATION. HAYS SPRINGS. Gentlemen : 1 am pleased to report that the year l'JOU •M a favorable one with the trees in western Nebraska. The ones at this station were loaded with fruit, a few kinds of whirh I have brought to the show. Khavc now about (j,000 trees doing well and have tried Y variety of fruit usually sold by nurserymen, and will, : now on, only have to try the newer varieties as fast as ►duced. I recommend for planting in the west part of the state for home or sale: Cherries — Dyehouse, Early Morello, Wragg. Plums — Sandoz, Larsen, Klondike, Wyant. Apples — Florence, Duchess, Yellow Transparent, Longneld. Pears — Flemish Beauty, Warner, Birkett, and claim that west Nebraska is even better adapted to cherries, plums, and pears than the eastern part, while only the earliest kinds of apples ought to be planted in the west, on account of the heavy Sep - tember frosts. A great industry could be built up in the west in raising Wragg cherries which ripen here August 15 to be sold at fancy prices at Omaha and Chicago after theirs are gone. I wish the Society would go on record in favor of the proposed parcel post, as no other convenience would so help to develop the west, and enable farmers off the railroad to get their mail. I need it every day. iiere is room in western Nebraska on unoccupied lands one million farmers and fruit raisers and I think the •rnment ought to discontinue giving away 640 acres of I to persons who will never use one acre, and ought to give land to our new emigrants, Italians, Greeks, and Aus - is who are now coming, and they would help build up the :, like the Germans did 30 years ago for the east.

Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska State Horticul- tural Society ■&gt; decorate from a florist's standpoint to arrange plants flowers suitable for various occasions may be easier done to explain. To be a successful decorator you must cultivate a love for Nature in its luxurious form, whereby you may be able to express or impress a pleasing effect suitable for the various occasions, whether it be a reception, a brilliant wedding, or some other floral decoration. My first recollection of decorating was some forty years ago in a sod house on one of these western prairies. The occasion being my birthday, tropical house plants then not being plentiful, but my mother a lover of Nature's beautiful flowers gathered native prairie flowers and cottonwood branches and with these decorated the sod walls of our humble home, making it look to me as a palace of beauty. Ewever this simple decoration has impressed me many a in the years since gone by, that it is not always the est or swellest of Mowers that make the longest or best ?ssion. Use what available flowers and ureen that are in s&lt; arrange them to the lx\st of your ability, establish a confi - dence in vourself that vou are a master of the art. DECORATING </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 I arranging avoid stillness, place things in the most ral position in the way most pleasing to the eye. Always rate for effect having in mind the object of your decora - whether it be a home decoration in honor of some friends, urih affair or a ballroom, a wedding or some national t. The first impression in entering a decorated place makts the most lasting effect and as you advance further it ought to be followed up with various vines, bowers, groups of plants, and tropical foliage and clusters of flowers as if to within these walls no cold winds shall ever strike our Kw for a parlor decoration, will say for a wedding, first le rooms if possible and arrange for the style and tone e decoration as well as the price. In decorating you must govern yourself some according to the price and style of the decoration. For an ordinary wedding place a group of tall palms at each side where the bridal party is to stand, with a light background of plants, arrange them in such a way that all pots are covered, making a natural display of foliage. You can also if wanted place a canopy made of asparagus plumosus or smilax over where the bridal party is to stand, making it a complete bower between the two groups of plants which makes a very fine effect. Ir if desired you can make a floral bell, a love knot or a ie-8hoe suspended draped from the ceiling with festoon - of asparagus or smilax fastened back to the walls in the &gt;e of a canopy. t there is a mantel you can bank the same with ferns ing tipped or laid down, making a complete bower of , place a bank of cut flowers in front of the mirror and the shelf with greens of asparagus or smilax. In front of the mantal place a few palms on each side with a few ferns and some blooming plants in front of the fireplace. What plants you now have left you can place in various </seg>

Bu are now through with the plant decoration, see that handeliers are festooned with asparagus or sinilax.

If a large table, you can place a mound of roses or carna - tions in the center in somewhat the same manner as the smaller table with additional smaller vase of flowers placed at the various corners of the table where it makes the most pleasing effect, if plates are laid for the serving of the guests a small bouquet or boutonniere at each plate is very appro- This form of table decoration can be applied as well to a reception or any other banquet and also the parlor decora - tion by leaving out the bridal stand. In decorating you should always place the main decoration around or about the center attraction of the function. If in a hall, around the speaker's platform, as well as in a room of ;i debutante or a party receiving callers, a pulpit or altar of a church. Always place the flowers and plants in the most natural position in &amp; way to avoid obstruct ins any of the views of </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 thi* renter attraction to the public; at the same time phut- all plants in such ways that all pots are covered, leaving nothing but a pleasing effect and an inspiring tone of these silent messengers of Nature's most beautiful growing emblems of life and health. And later on in life when we have finished our toil and our spirits have gone to the realms beyond and our bodies to 1m- placed in the last resting place it is very appropriate to decorate the same witli these beautiful lowen that we have so cherished, loved and toiled among during our life by placing a wreath or bum h of flowers on the last resting place, but until then let us always remember that it is far more pleasant and pleasing to scatter the flowers while our friends are living than to wait until death has parted us. K little decoration now and then here and there brightens ye, cheers the heart, and gives us more courage and in - tion for the advancement of the beautiful. DISCUSSION. t Williams : Mr. Henderson left out one article, one of st things we have for home decoration, the wild smilax. that exception I believe I will agree with him. E Henderson : I agree with you but we do not have much wild smilax around here. However, it is very priate. President Green : We will now have a paper by Mr. Irwin Frey on the subject of Commercial Carnations. COMMERCIAL CARNATIONS. IRWIN FBEY, LINCOLN. Some growers here will perhaps take exception to the list of strictly commercial carnations which it is my pleasure to present to you here this afternoon, but I wish to say that my endeavor will be to select leaders only in their respective colors, omitting many so-called "just as good" varieties. For I believe most of us are growing too many varieties, while if </seg>
            <seg id="p171">171 we would occupy our bench space only with the best, our cus - tomers would know, when ordering a certain color, just what they were going to receive. Suppose one of us were to order a thousand white carna - tious in Chicago today, not knowing the condition of the market. What would he get? If the supply is large, he will likely receive fine White Enchantress or White Perfec - tion. If the market is short, he will get a mixture of perhaps live or six varieties, from White Enchantress down to short - stemmed White Lawson. Why grow all these varieties when they find a market only when the best are out, and then are not satisfactory to the buyer? I think practically all of you will agree with me that the Enchantress family, consisting of Enchantress, White Enchantress and Rose Pink, stand preeminently at the head of commercial carnations in commerce at the present time. White and Rose Pink Enchantress show considerably more vigor of growth with us than does the original variety. I'hite Enchantress also has the advantage of being the keeper of the three, — a cardinal point to be considered a choosing a commercial carnation. Rose Pink, while having the best of keeping qualities, is invaluable for re - trade on account of its size and pleasing color, but from holesale point of view this is a drawback which cannot verlooked. I red carnations we have Beacon and Victory, either of h could not have attained the commercial success it has out the other, for this reason: Beacon is very prolific og December and January, and the bulk of the crop « at the holiday season when red is in greatest demand brings the largest financial returns. As to Victory, you depend upon the first flowers cut being of saleable ity, and while the bulk of the crop is over by Christ - they pay well for their room until the latter part of uary, when they are in crop again to stay until thrown to make room for young stock, the quality remaining </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 good. Thus the two varieties give tirst-class bloom through the entire growing season, while either one without the other would scarcely be considered a raccei. We are still waiting for a commercial dark pink carnation, and for lack of a better one will continue to grow Aristocrat, which realh belongs to the fancies, not being prolific- enough to grow in commercial quantities. .May Day, one of the introductions of 1909, I believe will be grown quite largely when it becomes better known. It is a beautiful shell pink, very prolific, and blossoms placed in a mixed vase of carnations were in fair shape three days after the others had gone to sleep. Methods of growing carnations vary greatly in different sections of the country, and I do not presume to tell you that our method would be successful under different climatic conditions or in different soil, etc., but will endeavor to tell you in as plain words as possible our methods, beginning with the propagation of young stock. There is a wide di - versity of opinion as to the use of bottom heat in propagating carnation cuttings. Some growers claim the bottom heat has a weakening effect upon the cuttings, and I believe this Is true if carried to extremes, but the only difference I can see between cuttings rooted in a temperature of 50 degrees overhead and a sand temperature of 58 degrees, and cuttings rooted in a temperature of 52 degrees, both in the sand and overhead, is that the space is occupied from ten days to two weeks longer without the bottom heat, in which time another batch would be well on the way to rooting. After the cut - tings are well rooted, which usually takes about twenty-one days, they are potted rather firmly in two-inch pots, using ordinary black prairie soil with a little sand added, but no manure. \\V commence propagating about the first of December, starting with those varieties which we wish to greatly In - crease in stock, and in this way our plants are not robbed of any great amount of strength at any one time. The earlier potted plants, after they become well rooted and </seg>
            <seg id="p173">173 before growth stops, arc turned out of their pots and heeled in on the bench, using only clean soil. Care must be taken to select a bench free from any drip, for should fungus get any start while they are in these crowded quarters it would sihiu cause gnat ruin. In handling plants in this way, growth never stops. Cuttings potted after the tenth of February in planted direct to the tield from the pots, being careful to see that all have been topped back before removing them. We plant in the field as early as the season will permit; usually about the 15th to 20th of April. Last year we handled six thousand plants in this way, and during the present year the number will greatly exceed this. {ter the plants are in the field they should be gone over a week, topping bark any which have ■ tendency to pro - buds. If this is not neglerti-d from the start there will o danger of cropping later — something which we try oid. The soil is cultivated just as often as its condition will permit. We have had our grated success with early planted stock, therefore about the first of July we commence to gtfl the houses in condition to bring the plants inside. Kvrry vestige of the previous season is removed. The l&gt;enches are washed off thoroughly with the hose and given a coat of hot line wash. Over this we put a covering of rotted manurt - about one inch thick, which settles to about half an inch after the soil is in : then the benches are filled level full of soil. We have used with equal success both top soil and what we term "second plowing." Upon this we add. half an inch of well rotted cattle manure, then this is worked ovr, using spading forks, being careful to break all lumps while doing so, and not turning deep enough to remove any manure from below, as this is for the plants later in the season. This gives us about four inches of soil and one inch of manure— - from only one-half of which, however, the plants derive im - mediate benefit. By planting thus early no extra shade is required on the glass to prevent wilting. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 The distance apart in planting varies according to growth of different varieties. Victory and varieties which do not make large plants are planted 9x11 inches, while for such varieties as Enchantress or Beacon, 10x14 inches is about The plants are kept well sprinkled until the bench is full, when it is given a thorough watering, and this is usually all the soil will require for five or six days, but the plants are sprinkled two or three times daily if the weather is bright, for the first two weeks. After this once a day will prevent wilting, except on very hot or windy days. Before the plants make much headway in " their new quarters they should receive their first tying up. We use the wire and twine system, running No. 18 galvanized wire lengthwise between the rows, and cross-tying with twine. Two to three tiers are put on in this way, according to th? height to which the variety grows. Ieeping the soil clear of weeds, maintaining an even tem - iture, watering and ventilating carefully, and disbudding, the main requirements until early in the new year, when beds are given a top dressing of Cattle manure, preferably too well rotted. In about two weeks this is worked into soil. As the days lengthen the plants grow much more dly and require large quantities of water. Emt the first of March a coat of rather coarse manure en, which runs the plants through the balance of the Ir. Henderson : If any one present can tell about out s variety called Her Majesty I wish they would do so; then there is a red one about half the size of Her Majesty blooms the first year: what T want to get at is the pinks will grow out of doors and will yield a good crop of prs, something that people can raise without being de - lent upon the greenhouses, as a great many farmers want DISCUSSION. </seg>

Certainly some are nwre highly prized than others. — for a difference it may be of foliage, flowers or fruit, or it may be a combination of all three, yet each has a beauty of its own, and an appropriate place in the grand scheme of making this world more habit - able and certainly more beautiful. We have here in Nebraska qnite a number of deciduous trees, many of which are decidedly capable of beautifying the landscape.

To the foregoing list of deciduous trees, we have intro - duced the following list of evergreens, which are highly or - namental, especially in winter, adding, oh, so much to the apparent warmth of the landscape: Austrian pine, Scotch pine, White pine, Red pine, Mugho pine, Bull pine, Norway spruce, white spruce, blue spruce, Douglas fir, balsam fir, Rocky Mountain green spruce, Engleman's spruce, Aides, (Oucolor or silver spruce, hemlock and arborvita. All of these do well when once established, making a wonderful growth in a few years, and on poor soil. We have trees of white pine, Austrian and Scotch pine twelve years trans - planted, 20 and 2."&gt; feet tall, and spruce the same age 15 feet The soft elm is conceded to be one of our finest and most desirable avenue or boulevard tr&lt;-es. The Sycamore is a tree of quick growth and adaptable to low and high land. It is of pyramidal form, with good foliage. The Ash, a tree of dense green foliage and compact growth, is desirable on the lower grounds. The Hackberry, a tree of good form and dense shade is a quick grower in good soil. The Linden, a desirable tree, both for its shade and bloom Eie Pin Oak, a symmetrical tree, and highly prized for its rht habit and clean cut appearance, and also for the tiful coloring of its leaves in Autumn. ES Red, and other Oaks, such as the White and Black and V cup, all make excellent trees for park or homestead ing. The Sugar Maple is a most desirable tree of dense and com - pact growth, although not a very fast grower. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">177 The Soft or Silver Maple is a quick grower, but requires lots of room for its proper development. K Sweet Chestnut, a good tree of rather commanding ance, and will make a very desirable addition to our ka aboriculture. Iie Cucumber Tree (magnolia aecuininata) makes a good, also a reliable tree in Nebraska, although not generally ted. §e Catalpa we all know, with its semi-tropical appear - has its advocates, and for a short period each year, is beautiful. The European Larch, a deciduous conifer, is a distinguishiil looking ornamental tree. It is also useful as a forest tree, — its wood having more tenstile strength than pine, and should be more generally grown. Ke Ginko, or Maidenhair, a Chinese tree, with peculiar s and of columnar growth, is sometimes grown as a t tree. Its branches often are curiously contorted, giv - t a weird appearance.

The Russian Olive, with its grey-green foliage standing ■gainst a dark background, makes a very effective tree. The Evergreens should not be overlooked, and this snowy weather makes them stand out even more prominently. As ornamentals in winter, believing that nothing we can plant, adds more to the material romfort and appearance of the homestead, than a shelter of pines, even a few choice ever - greens add so much to the looks of a place that I am convinced that each should endeavor (o have some.

Lemoine is of dwarf habit, and Pride of Rochester are the hardiest varieties to plant. For late summer blooming nothing can equal the hydrangeas. For massing against a background of shrubs they are very effective, more so than if planted in isolated positions on the front lawn. The most popular variety is Paniculata grandiflora. I. great favorite on account of its holding its foliage well the winter, and the ideal hedge plant, is the Ligustmm or »t. Of the six or seven varieties grown, the Californian d be my choice, were it not for its tendency to winter- Ibota is a good strong-growing variety, but the best hardiest for all purposes is the Polish. The Ligustrnni i regelianum is best adapted for single specimens on the with its drooping habits. Ee Rush Honeysuckles are valuable for screens. The s and berries are very showy. Lonicera tartarica iflora is a robust, upright grower. Lonicera morrowi broad spreading habit and is a very prolific bloomer. Althea rosea sometimes winter-kills, but it flowers so pro - fusely and comes in early fall when there is a lack of flowering shrubs.

            <seg id="p181">181 is another variety of shrubs that is tender till it gets estab - lished. The variety, Eva Kathke, for its profuse bloom aiul long blooming period, should be planted. The viburnums are a remarkable gnmp of ornamental shrubs and should be more widely grown. Hardy in growth, excellent in foliage which in fall changes to purple and later to red. The white flowers are borne in clusters, followed by panicles of fruit which cling to the bush during most of the winter. Viburnum sterile is an old garden favorite and very ornamental with its globes of white flowers which appear about Decoration Day, making it valuable commercially for decorating. Viburnum opulis (high bush cranberry), with its scarlet fruit, makes it one of the best for general planting. Puxnifolium (black haw), a tall native shrub with black fruit, and Dentatum with its dark green foliage, are very good. Khodotypus kerrioides, a shrub from Japan with its beautiful foliage, white flowers, and black berries, is quite hardy and satisfactory. Euonymus atropurpureus, or Wahoo, a native, is good for planting in the background. Euonymus alatus, Euro - poeus, and Badicans variegata are barely holding their own. There is nothing to equal Berberis thumbergii for a low orna - mental hedge,with its crimson leaves and bright red fruit in autumn. The purple leaved barberry or Vulgaris atropur - purea is a stronger grower and very useful for foliate effects. Caragana arborescens (Siberian pea tree) is distinct from other shrubs with its yellow blossoms and acacia-like foliage. Chionauthus Virginia (white fringe) is very attractive all summer with its fringe-like blossoms. When planted aa a screen for out-buildings or unsightly places no better shrub can be found than Tamarisk amurensis with its feathery foliage and pink flowers lasting from July to September. It is not harmed by freezing back since the young shoots are better than the old ones. The syringas or lilacs should not be overlooked. Vul - garis, the purple, and Alba, the white, varieties are old- </seg>

Villosa, a Japanese variety, is valuable because it blooms two weeks later than vulgaris, thus escaping late spring frosts. There are many hybrids; a few of the best we noted were Marie Legnje, a dwarf variety, White Madam Lenioine with im - mense leaves, La Tour dAvergne violet, Charles theTenth deep purple, Kertha Damuian-^-this form bears longer clusters than any other variety in cultivation — and Alphonse Lavalle blue. This year among these hybrids the borers did consid - erable damage. The Japanese quince is a fairly hardy shrub and can be used as a hedge plant. For cheering up the winter landscape Cornus sibirica with its brilliant red bark is very attractive. Native shrubs, such as Symphoricarpos occidentals, race - inosus, and vulgaris with their red and white berries, the sumacs with their bright autumn colors, and the wild row* are not to be despised for ornamental effects. Cultivated roses are rarely good for ornamental effect*. However, there are some exceptions, as in the case of some of the hybrid teas, the rugosas, and climbers. The hybrid perpetuals are best planted in straight rows and on one aide of the grounds to get the best results. For bedding, Qruss An Teplitz is very ellective where red can be used. Baby Rambler fades a little in the open when exposed to the hot sun. Killarney, Kaiserin, and white and pink Maman Chrochet are very good. For climbers we are all acquainted with Baltimore Belle, Prairie Queen, and Crimson Rambler. The objection to the last named is its susceptibility to mildew. A much better variety and not susceptible to this disease is the Dorothy Perkins, a pleasing shade of pink. tarn sorry that I cannot recommend very highly any of •vergreen shrubs.

            <seg id="p188">188 &lt; '. H. Green, temporary chairman. Ed Williams, tem - porary secretary. The purpose of this society shall be to promote the florieul - tural interests of Nebraska. The name of this society shall l&gt;e the Nebraska State Florists Society. This society shall lie an auxiliary to, and be composed of florists who are mem- Irts of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society. The presi - dent of this society shall be an ex-omcio member of the official board of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society. The officers of this society shall be a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and three dirctors and the term of office shall be for one year. The election of officers shall be held at the time of annual meeting of the Nebraska State Horticul - tural Society. The duties of the officers shall be the same as like officers in similar societies. Itiese by-laws shall be subject to the approval of the Ne - ka State Horticultural Society and may be amended at annual meeting of this society by a vote of two-thirds arity, of the members present. The annual dues shall be 50 cents per member. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year : President — Irwin Frey, Lincoln. Vice-President — Louis Henderson, Omaha. Treasurer^ — J. E.

Williams: The florists as a rule have not taken an interest in the Horticultural Society, and in this instance a few of us got together and thought the thing over and thought in this manner: We could draw them together more and work more harmoniously, still they could be members of the State Horticultural Society, and the two societies could work together. They have to be members of the State Horticul - tural Society before they can become mefnbers of the Auxil - iary Society. I think they ought to be allowed to come into the Auxiliary Society first and then into the Horticultural Kjsident Green : This Florists Society is a part of the [cultural Society and is not a distinct body in any way. proposition of membership is first, to belong to the icultnral Society and then the Florists Society.

HOW WE GREW AND MARKETED 12,000 BUSHELS OF APPLES. fi. A. MARSHALL. ARLINGTON. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen : I have the same old excuse, I did not get my paper .vrittm. Hut I made a few notes and 1 will try to follow them along. The care of our orchard, as it is compared with the care ■ good farmer gives his corn, I expect would cause us to l&gt;lush and say that it was not very good. All we did was cut the weeds down in the orchard and prune the trees just a little; we didn't give them the pruning they should have. There is a good deal of care our orchard might have had that it did not have. It is true we kept it free from weeds and prosed it gome but we can easily ne where we could improve it luit we have never spent much money on the care of our orchard. Ob the tth«r hand 1 don't think it takes a great deal &lt;&gt;f money to care for an orchard. I believe we have made some people believe it takes a good big bank account to care for it. It simply needs willingness and good horse sense. It does not require the attention some other crops do. There is a Ion;: season that you can do the pruning and removing the brush and if you don't hap|&gt;en to be able to cultivate the orchard this week you can wait until the next week, — it won't ruin the crop like it would a crop of corn. If you will attend to it when you get a chance I will guarantee that you will grow a" big an apple orchard in this section of the country as easily as anywhere in the United States. After we have considered that we must remember that we can not expect returns with - out care. Do not misunderstand me that I recommend we should not give the orchard proper care. I am speaking a&lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p191">191 to how easily it is. After cutting out the weeds and pruning, spraying 3 times constituted the care this year. We sprayed the first time just before I he blossoms opened with a 4-4-50 mixture of Bordeaux and in spraying that time we aimed to use the power sprayer, but we broke one of the engines and lost a day or two; therefore we had to take two small Moreley l&gt;uin]is and spray with hand power, so almost a third of onr orchard was sprayed the first time with a hand sprayer. The ■ ud spraying was begun a little after the blossoms fell. A part of this spraying was done with a hand pump, but it was not satisfactory at all. We got our results where we used our power sprayer. We kept the pressure up pretty well. - from 160 to 200 pounds. The University boys looked after that, we didn't spray any with less than 160 pounds pressure. The 3rd spraying was applied about 3 weeks after the second. We intended to spray again the latter part of July, but could not find any worms or any indications of them so we dis - pensed with that spraying, going on the cheap plan like the Nebraska people nearly always do. I suppose we would have had a little better fruit if we had sprayed again, yet when it came gathering time we found less than 2 per cent of worms and not enough scabs to mention. We had some defective apples because we had a hail storm, of fine hail. They were not damaged badly, but were pecked just enough to keep them off the fancv market. What we noticed in spraying led us to believe that we had better watch the varieties for scab. We noticed that the Winesap needed more Bordeaux and fortunately it was harder to injure them with Bordeaux than the Ben Davis. We noticed that the Grimes Golden was more easily injured with Bordeaux and did not need so much. Tt seems that we could not hurt the Winesap but could easily hurt the Grimes Golden with the mixture and the Grimes did not need as much. For the second spraying we used Bordeaux on the Winesaps only, using a 3-3-50 formula with 2 pounds of arsenate of lead. On the balance of the orchard we used 2 pounds of </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 arsc-nate of lead to 50 gallons of water, omitting the Bor - deaux. For the third spraying we used a 3-3-50 formula of Hordeaux and 2 pounds of lead arsenate. This was in cloudy, wet weather, and the boys who tried this almost died with fright a week later because the orchard looked like a field of yellow roses and it knocked off half of the leaves, but it came out all right and the balance of the leaves stayed on the real of the season and the trees seemed to ripen up splendidly. As an experiment one of the best rows in the orchard was sprayed but once. We got between 400 and 500 barrels from that row and it was sprayed just once with arsenate of lead 2 pounds, to 50 gallons immediately after the blossoms fell. That row looked about the best of anj - in the orchard until rather late in the fall when it weakened down a bit and some of the trees were almost destitute of foliage. Wkca we came to gather the apples we found the apples on those trees were pretty badly hurt by the early frc-eze up in that country, but we got results there that have been worth something. We do not think we will try leaving any of the trees in the future without at least one spraying of Bordeaux. In selling the apples we sold Xo. 1 and No. 2 to a firm in Chicago, agreeing to pick and hauled the apples to town. The culls were thrown in baskets by the graders and we loaded them in bulk and sold them to a Kansas firm. Our picking force consisted of 7 or 8 nursery boys that stay with us the year through and a bunch of pickers that were hired by the bushel. We picked up mostly prospective corn huskers and would have hail no trouble in getting 25 or more just as easily. A good corn husker makes a good apple picker. He can make about as much picking apples as husking and is therefore slow to leave. They averaged between 65 and 70 bushels per man, some averaging 80 and 90 bushels. A Member : How much did you pay a bushel ? Mr. Marshall : We paid 4 cents a bushel, or 3 cents and hoard. We had a boarding house there and most of them </seg>
            <seg id="p193">193 A Meaber: How did you measure them? Mr. .Marshall: In bushel baskets. The graders followed the pickers through the orchard and the baskets were dumped on the grading tables. The Chicago firm furnished the graders. We told them how many bushels we would pick per day and 'hev said they had plenty of graders to take care of them. The graders could not take care of them and they gave us the privi - lege to take the rest and store them in a storehouse where they would be out of the way and protected. We got 400 soft stave baskets and wo turned them into the baskets and the foreman of the graders checked them up before they were hauled to the storage or to the grading table. We gen - erally had one sot stacked in tho orchard and the balance were hauled to the shod. They didn't grade near as fast as wo picked them and we had 5,000 bushels in the shed at one time. Our expense was between 29 cents and 30 cents a barrel for gathering and getting them to tho cars. We added some expense on that that should have boon added the bulk apples and wo can cut that down probably 10 per cent an - other vear. T discovered that when tho apples wore scattered on the trees the pickers would want more money. Last year we had a groat many scattering apples, tho trees didn't bear at all or only just bear on one side and the pickers would object to that very much, but generally those apples were large and A Member: What kind of ladders do yon nse? I. Marshall : Tho ladder we liked best was the Niagara, broad at tho bottom and slopes in from the bottom and s in to a point with a stick in the top so that you can t push it through the trees. Yon want a ladder tall rh to roach to tho top of tho tree. Yon would think a ■r 24 or 26 foot high would bo tall, but wo have trees a« s that and yon must have that high a ladder. Yon want der for every picker. The picker does not get so tired as ies when yon have one man pick on the ground or in the </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 tree all the time. That would tire both of them, they like to pick on the ground a little while and ihen climb on the ladder part of the time. A good picker will start at the bottom of the ladder and pick up as lie goes, la organising your lone it is best if you can arrange for checking them up at night so i hat each one knows how many bushels ho had picked. Von &lt; an do that where you don't want to scatter them all o\ ■ r and let each boy have a rope to fasten to the half brake! basket and snap the oilier end on the rod of the ladder. Eadi man's name is on the ladder, you want that too and when lie has his basket full he calls the overseer and he drops the basket down and the overseer unsnaps it and snaps on an - other and he takes one of these little punches and punches out the ticket and then each boy knows how much he has picked. We raised our average 10 bushels a day the first day we adopted that plan. All the overseer has to do is to see that the apples are not bruised and the trees an 1 picked clean. II'' don't have to spur them up; he has to hold them down ami see that they don't bruise- the apples. I would recommend having a cushion in every basket. It eeta the apples and encourages the boys to be careful. causes them to realize it is meant for them to be careful icy have everything protected. A Member: Do you pick in sacks that way? IT. Marshall: I believe we picked a little in sacks. The ing jackets we never tried. The hanging baskets that 9 a hook on that he hooks to the limbs are the beat, ami overseer must see that the hoy does not toss the apples. &gt;nt like the jacket, for one reason you can't swing off to side. I believe the picking jackets have some merit. t people use them and T would like to hear what they have ay. A Mem her : How do von cushion the baskets? Kr.

            <seg id="p195">195 Burden hose aud split it and pot it right over the top &gt;f the basket and put a gannj sack in the bottom. Did usliion your baskets, Mr. .Mincer? Mr. Mincer: Yes, I lined them all. Mr. Marshall: What was your plan? K Mincer: We lined our baskets with a double thickness rlap. We took about 3 thicknesses and tacked on the lge of the basket. A Member: Did vou try it with rubber? E. Mincer: I didn't try it but I know a grower who did. lid he had very good luck with it. It seemed like as nice &lt;hion as you could get, of course anything sofr on. Mr. Dickinson: What kind of a basket did you use? K. Marshall: We used just a common round bottom t. A little half bushel basket witli a bail. Mr. Dickinson: Then you didn't use the regular ci shaped basket made for pit-King. Yours was not crescent shaped, just a little half bushel basket? Mr. Marshall : Y&lt; ■•. Dickinson: There is a picking basket crescent shaped that is the kind we thought you used. Mr. Marshall : This one we used is the same kind of a one Kthey use at Hamburg that section. It is a r&lt; and Chillicothe. We got them L r ular apple picking basket. a eresrent shaped basket wli shoulder and the basket stands Kr. Davidson : It is not hitch a strap over your : in front of the man? Mr. Marshall: Xo, our boys put a wire hook on them. I believe a fellow could pick a little faster in one of t' baskets. A fellow micrht pick a little faster in one of t' jackets. Bat our men had no trouble at all, some pickiru bushels a day. A good many didn't run over fiO bushels a day. ami some went down as low as 40 bushels, but those fel - lows, of course can't pick apples. We had some old men there that were afraid to climb on the ladders and we had some </seg>
            <seg id="p196">196 fellows there that couldn't do anything only draw their pay, they looked for the other fellows to do the work. We worked l he average up because the good pickers we would keep aud would let the others go. 1 don't believe we could have gotten our apples picked in time with the amount of men we had if we hadn't organized them that way. I was in some orchards where they didn't know how many bushels a man had picked, and they seemed to have about as much trouble in keeping them from getting bruised as we did. Our men were somc - what careless but as our apples were sold, on account of beiag hail injured, as a kind of a commercial grade they were not graded up as close against bruising as they would have been if they had bees sold for real fancy apples. We had to watch them right along. 1 don't care how you have them picked, if yon never say a word about bruising the pickers will jret to bruising them. If you don't say anything about picking the tre&lt;&gt;s clean the pickers won't pick them clean. I don't believe you have to pay any more attention to this in hiring them this way than any other way. A Member: How do you get them to market? Br. Marshall : We hauled them in a spring wagon. It about |(! or $8 to buy a pair of springs and we got some M)t planks and put them on the springs. Mr. Williams : How long a season does it take to pick your winter apples? Ir. Marshall: I don't know.

Marshall : Ordinarily I would not be afraid to leave til the 1st of November, but this year the freezing was so it froze the small Winesaps clear to the core and in- </seg>
            <seg id="p197">197 I and it reduced the yield some. They were pretty heavily ed. The University boys, Mr. Howard and Prof. Einer left Si trees that thi*y did not spray at all and they lust f leaves, putting it in a rough way I would say th.: s didn't have any more leaves on them than should be on trees, and those apples were pretty badly hurt. I looked hem on the ground and I know our graders would not ■ taken very many of them. The shells were badly col - ed and 1 think they would have been classed as bad apples I) days. A Member: When was that freeze? Mr. Marshall: The 12th or 13th of October; it was the worst freeze I ever saw on apples in this country. 1 dont think we would expect such a freeze very often. The small winesaps were frozen clear through. I examined them and a good many never did come out just right; 150 miles north - west of us they said their apples were nearly all ruined l&gt;y that freeze. 1 saw some apples down below Hamburg, la., that were hurt by that same freeze. Mr. Davidson: What was the experience with the apples going through the freeze? Mr. Marshall: That didn't show. Mr. A. A. Lash : I would not want to chance them in cold storage very long, not over 60 days. A Member: What time do you aim to get vour apples picked? B. Marshall: If you want good apples you must let them pe. This season they wen late, they started late. They fully two weeks late in the spring in getting started. A Member: Did you pick your Jonathans before the rest? I". Marshall : Oh, yes, we picked the Grimes first and we followed on the heels of the Grimes with the Jona - !, and then there was a little intermission between thorn the Ben Davis. There ought to be, hadn't there, Mr. ? </seg>

Marshall: That didn't take very many, the graders he e«lla in the baskets and the wind-falls were picked placed in piles. Another tiling in orchard work jam d have is some tarpaulins. They will save you hustling id to protect applet left in the orchard. Mr. Atkinson: Did you haul the bulk apples in baskets? I-. Marshall : Yes, sir, the picking and hauling to town illy all there is to it. If you put them on the ground it something to pick them up and you don't have to do that hi have baskets enough. I will tell you another thing, couldn't expect to dispose of. every year, cull apples so y. It worked this year all right, but we wouldn't count next year. We would put those cull apples in a car and them out West and sell them with apples that had not sprayed. They are just about like them, and we get i out where they have always been buying such apples. Prof. Emerson : I want to say that the apples that were railed out would eoinpare with the apples shipped from south - eastern Nebraska, where the whole crop was taken and sold from the orchard. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">199 ■Member: What price did you get compared with the r apples? Mr. -Marshall : We got from 50 to 75 cents per 100 pounds for the culls. Mr. Williams: What did you get for your best apples? I Marshall : 1 never measured the orchard, but I expect is about 40 acres. In the items of expense there ap - l one power sprayer, and 1 think our net return was a more than $3,500. V Member: How many acres are there Mr. Marshall : Well, between 40 and 50 acres, but part of the orchard is only 11 years old. The bulk of it is over 11 yean old, — from eleven to sixteen years. We didn't have a half a crop of apples this year, we got 1:2,000 bushels; we got 6,000 bushels off of 8 acres that was sixteen years planted, they were planted in 18D3. There was about 575 or 600 trees on that S acres, while there were acres of ground that did not have over 50 bushels to the whole acre. Mr. Howard has been in the orchard and be knows that tree after tree did not have au apple on it at all. The youngest orchard only yielded l.Kiio bushels and there is eleven acres in that, and the fruit was all on certain trees. Mr. Atkinson: Did you spray the third time, whether they had apples on or not? Mr. Marshall : No, we sprayed all of them the second time. ■ Member: What was it Professor Whitten told us about curculio? I)fessor Whitten : Most of our orchardists did not spray. did not give much care to their orchards. We have some who do, and those men who take care of their orchards that they can kill the curculio by spraying very well, see you will get some of the curculio on the first spray - I think you ought to use the arsenate of lead for the spraying, two pounds to 50 gallons of bordeaux. A Member: Is that after the petals fall? Professor Whitten : No, before, and with the next spray- </seg>
            <seg id="p200">200 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. iiig about two or three weeks later, if I was going to poison the curculio with only one spraying 1 think 1 would put the poison on with the second spraying. We handle the curculio very well that way, and you dont have much trouble with it. Professor Emerson : 1 want to say a word about the frosts injuring the apples. At Tecuiuseh we noticed injury lirst on trees that were not sprayed, and we noticed there also that the leaves were hurt worse on the unsprayed trees. The work at Tecuniseh was done with Mr. Scott of the United States Department of Agriculture aiid he noticed that particularly, lie noticed that the leaves hanging on the unsprayed I were killed and thai the trees that were sprayed came through all right from the frost. Another thing, a question was asked when apples ought to be picked. In our experience where there were sprayed and unsprayed tree* we found it was difficult to gauge the pick - ing time and get the best results. If we picked all at once, the unsprayed apples were ripe and the ones that had been sprayed had not finished coloring up yet. And while we were waiting until they were all ripe the apples from the unsprayed trees would be on the ground. At lilair we had that experi - ence and they were practically worthless except for culls. I remember Mr. Marshall's apples when they were picked, when those from the unsprayed trees were ready to be picked, if we picked from the sprayed trees the men complained that they were hard to pull off. Mr. President: Our next topic is "Guarding Against Frosts and Freezes with Smudges and Heaters," by Mr. C. E. Mincer, of Hamburg, Iowa. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">201 GUARDING AGAINST FROSTS AND FREEZES WITH SMUDGES AND HEATERS. C. E. MINCER, HAMBURG, IOWA. Air. President and Ladies and Gentlemen : When 1 was assigned by your Secretary to say a few words in regard to this subject 1 prepared a few remarks based upon some little experience 1 had had myself and upon the experi - ence of a number of people 1 have had the opportunity to meet duriug the past year. The things 1 shall be able to tell you will come more from people 1 have come in contact with than from my own experience. Since preparing that paper I had the pleasure of seeing Professor L. \V. Powers, who read a paper at the Missouri meeting on the same subject and which was very exhaustive. 1 shall turn this paper over to the So - ciety here to use in your report, as I consider it very valuable, but 1 wish to give him full credit for anything I may copy from him, right at this time. Although this subject was lim - ited to the protection from frosts and freezes by the use of smudges and heaters, the remarks the gentleman just made about apples being frozen in the fall differing from those that were not frozen on account of the care that was given them, there was nothing said about coming through the bloom - ing time. In our section we have proved successfully that the trees that are sprayed will stand the frosts of the spring better than those not sprayed. This is not an experiment. So it is really very wise to guard against frosts and freezes outside of using smudges and heaters. The experiments in protect - ing orchards against frosts and freezes extends back quite a while. In France they used to build screens and vines and then they tried to stretch wires on poles and cover them with cloth. There have been methods tried in irrigated countries of turning water in the ditches, which produces moisture 1b the air In othpr ninrpa thov 1«1H ntrwM thrnn»h th» niv»ka&gt;vt </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 to produce spraying of water, something like the spraying «« haw beea hearing about today, with a spraying pole be - iwccn every tree: This lias been successful, but it proved too j io cany out and too dillk-ult to manage. A few jean afjB in California they coouncatced to experiment with oil, with coal oil heaters. There is a distinction between the pro - icftion by Mundgf and the protection afforded by heaters. We all know that on a &lt; loudy night there is not much dauber of anything being injured by frosts because the clouds hold what heat there is in the atmosphere close to the ground. This same recall is produced by smudging, which forms a ili-nse smoke over the orchard and holds the air to the ground, which is about the only benericial effect to be gained by smudging. In the use of heaters of the various types for coal oil the results are derived from the amount of heat they will produce. It has been said that by the use of heaters the teni - peratwe can be raised from l' degrees to 12 degrees. In many place* where they have crops destroyed by frosts the raising of the temperature 3 or -1 dagrm would have saved those i Tops. In California and Colorado they have saved a good many crops. One of the principal heaters now used and go - ing to be used, especially in this section of the country, is the oil heater. They will hold from 3 to 10 gallons of oil, there is gallon one burning outside the building now, and they will burn about tea hours. It is necessary, in many parts of the country, only to burn them a few hours to protect the fruit. An oil heater is built so you can govern the heat. This smudge oil can l&gt;e furnished for about 3 cents a gallon. If necessary to burn the pot all night it would take about 15 cents to run one pot all night, 100 pots to the acre would be about $15 per acre per night, and the pots themselves cost 20 cents — from 20 to 50 cents, depending on their size. If you had a frost that only occurred one night it would only cost you $30 to $50 an acre for that protection. If you were in any other business you could not afford to lose f 1,000 for the sake of refusing an outlay of $50. Another thing that you </seg>
            <seg id="p203">203 tto do — as soon as you get them they want to be dipped ide oil and they will last for years without rusting. You t no loss outside of the original investment, even if you use them. In many pails of the country smudging has been tried by burning manure. We tried smudging one year and saved a crop of peaches. We didn't have the only peaches, but had about the only peaches on the same level and many oth - ers on that same level were killed. It was conclusive to us and we were satisfied to invest in enough oil heaters to equip our orchard. Une should be placed between every four i tilled with oil and a cover or shield iaid over it, so that when the time comes when you need it you will be ready. If you wait for the time to come you are not going to do it. The lighting of the pots is accomplished by a man taking a burn - ing gasoline torch, like those used for burning off paint, or a blow torch. Three or four men can light 1,000 pots in a very short time. A little instrument which the fruit gro\ of Colorado are using i.s an automatic thermometer which cm lie placed at various parts of the orchard connected with a telephone in your own house which will ring a bell; the cost is nut very great, about $10, for the apparatus. This will give you absolute warning of any local conditions; oftentimes von can not get the weather reports soon enough. A Member: Have you the address where this can be gotten? Mr. Mincer: Peter Henderson Company, Courtland Sti New York City. The more detailed apparatus is imported, but if you will correspond with them you can get all the in - formation you require; these people are well known. Tlitv are advertised by different firms in the florists' papers. I don't believe in planting things in certain phases of the n, but I have noticed that there is not much danger from k to the trees in the late of the moon, and we have had » severe frosts. We have used manure in smudging by putting a pile be- </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 tweea every four trees aud wet it and then it produced a dense smoke so that the manure has a beneficial effect In - forming a cloud of smoke above the orchard retaining the heat that might be there, but there is very little heat that Its from the manure pile. It is far better to burn the oil than the manure because the manure it too valuable for the of the land. Another thing, a couple of years ago we tried to save something by burning the manure and we had a ( ontinual frost ami we rim out of the stuff wheu we Beaded it the most. If a person is equipped with oil it is easy to place it iu the pots procured especially for that purpose. A .Member: How do you store the oil? I'. .Mincer: We are preparing at this time to put in a holding about 6,000 gallons, and we will haul it from torage and put it in these tanks until it is used. Now 11 have any question* or if there is any phase I haven't ted on if you will ask the questions I will try and answer questions. Prof. Emerson : What weight or type of crude oil do you Mr. .Mincer: It is a type designated by the Standard Oil Company as smudge. It is a grade with the gasniinr and lighter oil removed which the jjas companies use. .Mr. Dickinson: Do you use any waste to start the lire? B. Mincer: Our orchard has never been equipped with caters, we only had just a few, our only practical ex - nce has been with manure. We have had a few potR id a few trees. A Member : About how extensive were your experiments? Mr. Mincer: We protected about 12 acres of apples and a good many acres of peaches, probably 20 acres. A Member: With oil heaters? Mr. Mincer: No, only about 20 trees with oil. Part coal and part oil. We raised the temperature 6 degrees. A Member: How many did you have to the acre? Mr. Mincer: On 20 trees we h«ul n heater for everv treo. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">205 IB that time I have been in an orchard near Chicago where icres were equipped with heaters and they allowed 120 to the acre and they raised the temperature 10 decrees this result was accomplished in about 30 minutes from time of lighting the pots. K. Dickinson: How many beaten could a man light in ur? Ir. Mincer: I should say a thousand, easily. It is simply itter of getting to the heaters. If there is a danger of : and you are in a hurry. — the orchard that I saw pped I helped the man light tliem up, there was a heater een every 4 trees we wrrv • ■ ' I with a gasoline torch we didn't have to stop. A Member: Are these heaters equipped with a little w: Mr. Mincer: No sir, nothing. A Member: Just provided with pure oil? Mr. Mincer : Yes sir. Br. Dickinson : T did not think the heat was intense igh to light the pure oil. Another Member: Were the heaters on the ground? Br. Mincer: Yes sir, we filled the heaters and placed the over them to prevent the rain from getting in before the of using them. Kr. Yonnirers: Tn reference to storinir oil. in California it stored in cisterns, in some plnees tbev would rnn it ricrht i the car into the cistern with a hose. Ir. Mincer: My reason for storing it in a tank is that we 1 a bank risrht near onr orchard and T am going to put tank on that bank. T can run it ritrht from my wagon z into the tank and T wont have to lift it then. ■ Member: Has it been successful running water thronch orchard to keep the frost off?

A Member: About how far apart would those heaters I. placed iu your orchard? ■r. Mincer: Hetween every 4 trees we placed the nianur brush that we smudged with. A Member: Thai would be in every row? Mr. Mincer: Every other row, in the neighborhood of 60 feit apart. I 'resident Green: Practically a heater for everv tree? Mr. Mincer: We expect to have more than that, one for evi tv tree each way in a row. Between the trees each way Eidcnt Green: A man would have to go pretty lively to .000 wouldn't he? lie would have to travel between VI miles in an hour. Ir. Mincer: lie wouldn't have as much difficulty as you d suppose for if you were going down a row, here would trees that you could light the heater, there would be three there together. In the little orchard where I saw the tical demonstration of raising the temperature there 1.000 heaters on 10 acres. 100 to the acre and we were idemlily less than an hour in lighting them. President Green: Flow do yon control your smudge in a high wind? B. Mincer: You have to arrange your brush or heaters the orchard. At Grand Junction they raise the tem - ure by lighting ftren on th^ windward side of the orchard. \ Member: Tsn't it feasible to pile brush there to be u«-d for that purpose? B. Mincer: If a freeze wonld come along for a few one night only your brush piles would save you, but if uulil be a heater. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">207 you are depending on that and it lasted all night and the next night and the next night too you would be out of fuel. A Member: While you are lighting one side of your or - chard and they are burned out on the other side you are only partially protected at a time? Mr. Mincer: That is what occurred with me when I tried it. We couldn't get them all lighted in time, and after we did get them all lighted the ones on the Hat burned out and we couldn't keep the fire going. Mr. Dickinson : How do you manage the oil pots in windy weather? Mr. Mincer: There is no difficulty, the wind probably wouldn't be strong enough to blow them out. If you desire to put them out lay a flat piece of tin on the pot and that will A Member: How do you protect them? Mr. Mincer: There is a shield that fits right over the top. There is a blow pipe of iron bent in the form of a V. Down at the University of Missouri Dr. Howard told me that he had conducted a number of experiments on peach trees there. We experimented with brush, but the greatest difficulty wo had was to maintain a fire long enough. We did get some absolutely certain results when we used oil heaters, they could be depended upon. Professor Emerson : There is one of these heaters burn - ing now at the South end of this building and you can put it out in the wind and see how much it would stand, how much it would take to blow it out. Mr. Howard: I want to ask Mr. Mincer if he isn't a little high in his estimate of the cost of heat. I understood him to say f!5 an acre per night with 3 cent oil? Mr. Mincer: Yes sir. Mr. Howard : We have a burner here burning the kind of oil of your standard burner, and we find that one of t! hpntprft will hnrn (\ finnps \vithrmt inv ti*onhlp irnl fnr fi hours </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 you can do it with at least $3 an acre with this kind of oil with 100 pots per acre. A Member: What price do you have to pay for oil? I It. Howard : They quoted oil to me yesterday at fB.66 hundred f. o. b. cars Jackson County, Missouri, and I ;d what the freight would be on a car this far, and he f 76 a car in tanks. It don't matter about the size of the i, from that place to Lincoln it is f 76 a tank plus $ 2.65 hundred for that kind of oil. In answer to a question as ow readily it would ignite, — we used a little excelsior on it used the blow torch and the fire from that will produce ; enough to start it all right. They claim they are not ing anything on the oil ; that everything has been taken i it and they are simply disposing of it this way at just it cost. Mr. Williams: There was a man in Colorado at Grand Junction, that heated for 6 or 7 nights, and it cost him be - tween $11 and fl2 per acre for those 6 nights and that in - cluded wear and tear on his machinery. That is he took the first cost, — what he paid for his tanks and heaters, — and divided that by 10 and included in that his oil that he used and that flO or fll included the wear and tear on his machinery too. Mr. Mincer: The type I expect to use is larger and has several apertures so you can control the use of the oil, the chances are that you would not need that much. Mr. Howard : With that kind of a heater you can regulate the amount of your burning surface. Mr. Mincer : The type I refer to are regulated by a cap on top of the heater. If it is very cold you can take the cap clear off and burn the heater the whole size of the top. That is a Troutman heater. Mr. Howard : Have you ever used the Hamilton heater? Mr. Mincer: No sir. I don't think it makes much differ - ence what kind von use. Mr. Yager: What has been your observation of the effect </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 of these heaters ou small fruits like strawberries and fruits &lt;&gt;f that kind? .Mr. Mincer: I have made no observations of that kind at Professor Emerson : I saw au account of an experiment in Colorado and this indicated that they were of very little value for small fruit, its value depending upon the thickness of the stand of trees, in young orchards there was less pro - tection than in older orchards where there is more top to hold the heat. This statement came from some one around Grand Junction. I. Davis : I guess there never has been found anything would help. The only benefit ever received from the e is that the smoke will scatter over the fields and make ud, but as far as the heat is concerned I can not learn they ever invented anything that will help that any. Mr. Mincer: No matter what kind of fuel you burn it forms a cloud above the trees and what heat there is is hpld to the ground and the temperature would be a great deal higher than it would be up from the ground.

A price per barrel w;is decided on at the State Fair our Member* who had a fruit crop this year responded generously, althoagh the money paid for the fruit, con - ing the necessary selection, care, and packing, was less the regular market price for Che same quality of fruit. To the following members of the Society we are indebted for prompt and generous exhibits: .M;irshall Bros., of Arlington. Isaac Pollard &amp; Son, of Xehawka. E. P. Stephens, of Crete. B. II. Davev, of Blair. T. I'. Brown, of Florence. &lt;!. S. Christy, of Johnson. Arnold Martin, of Pul'.ois. I members packed and shipped the fruit to the Bloom - ■e and Cold Storage Company of Council Bluffs, where it cared for until the opening of the congress free of charge, worthy of note that in all cases where fruit was put in xxl condition it came out and stood the week of the con - 's and part of the exhibit was repacked and shipped to oln Cold Storage for this meeting. In selecting fruit for this meeting we were handicapped hx not Baring the permanent premium list, as they sent out an early prospectus of the meeting, and the one we showed under was not issued until all fruit for exhibition purposes w;is gathered and in cold storage. For instance, one of the trophies was given for the best 25 boxes of five varieties, five boxes of each. Had we known this we might have added some to the premiums we were able to take and given a little more advertisement to the Nebraska fruit growers. As it was we showed in as many places as was possible for the Society to get in and won some premiums. We received an award of a gold medal for the most artistic (1isd1&lt;iv wh icli wis *i t Tlilc 3. bout 40 foot loner with the word </seg>

I'e also received the trophy offered by the Grape Growers' niation of Council I.luffs for the best exhibit made by state horticultural society. Also a silver loving cup for l&gt;est eight varieties for continuous season on the farm. *e with about $175 in cash, which came very handy in ing to defray the expenses of the exhibit, were the awards •h our exhibit was awarded. While noting the awards the Society took we must not for - ger the fruit-judging team from Nebraska which won the trophy ottered for the best fruit judging team. Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa were competitors, with our boys first. This trophy has to be won twice out of three times before it be - comes the property of the winners, consequently it will be necessary for the next team to again win in order to hold the t rophv. In the exhibits at Council Bluffs one thing was especially noticeable, all the exhibits were put up by scientific exhibitors — there were none of the amateur exhibits that we so often at our state and county meetings and all of the fruit showed for itself that it had been grown under the best con - ditions possible as to cultivation, pruning, spraying, selec - tion, and packing. Bie representation was from Maine to Idaho and from Iowa Nebraska to Texas and Mississippi with Maryland and h Carolina on the southeast, so that all sections of the ed States were represented. The value of such a meeting is the question that all are wont to raise, Does it pay and how? Nebraska with her red Jonathan and her fancy Yellow Grimes made a hit with every one who examined our exhibit, and many who tasted our fruit were thoroughly convinced </seg>
            <seg id="p213">213 that Nebraska was easily the home of these two choice varieties. ■e were well supplied with these two varieties ami J liberal in distribution, so that it was a common saying. to to see, but come to Nebraska to eat." Another question was the package. Our fruit growers have been packing choice fruit iu barrels whieh sold for from two to three dollars per barrel. Our friends who had packed iu boxes were getting from two to three dollars per box of 50 pounds each, makiug quite a difference iu the revenue de - rived from the orchard. Kis of course would only apph to the choice varieties and e fruit of the variety, but M we grow much of this kind lit in Nebraska it behooves the fruit men to take notice. The quality of our fruit was shown in the single plate ex - hibits. Nebraska took second on Grimes in competition with those grown under irrigation, Colorado only beating us mi A school of instruction in the packing of boxed apples was one of the features of the congress which drew quite a lot of attention. An expert packer demonstrated the different kinds of packs during the meeting and assisted any one who wished to learn. Bis, I think, would be an attractive feature to add to our fair meeting, as the fair is just before the time when the crop is ready to harvest. There is some effort being made to pack in paper b similar to fillers for egg cases only the filler holds six or twelve apples and these boxes put in a wooden box, but I am of the opinion that these are too expensive for our mark- K conclusion — drawn from the exhibitors' experiences — necessary that we cultivate, prune, spray, and then use ackage best adapted to your market. Then he who fol - these lines and does it the most thoroughly will mark as at the foot of his orchard account. Before closing these rambling remarks I wish to thank our </seg>

Marshall, who so ably helped iustaill the exhibit and tare for it during the exposition. -Mr. President: The next topic on our program is a dis - cussion of the fence posts of the future. Mr. Youngers was called for and spoke as follows THE FES&lt;/E POSTS OF THE FUTUKi 1 didn't know that 1 would be called upon, and 1 wasn't expecting to speak on this subject. 1 believe it is a good idea to plant for fence posts and I don't believe it is very material what kind of a tree we plant. I want to say that when 1 was at St. Louis a few years ago I had the pleasure of viewing a lot of experiments by the Government. They used the wil - low, maple, and cottonwood. They had tested them by bury - ing them six or seven years under the ground and those \ i were taken up and used there in that experiment. They were perfectly sound at that time. It did not seem to make much difference what kind of a tree you used, whether it was the willow, ash, maple, or cottonwood, provided you got the ma terial thoroughly saturated. The catalpa seems to be a - kind of fence posts. We have records in Indiana where that tree has been used for forty to sixty years, and the fence p are still solid without any form of treatment. K. Brown : In the Government tests were the posts buried letely under the soil? Mr. Youngers : .Some of them. The tender point of the fence post is right at the ground. Some of the posts were completely covered, others were not. They had different ex - periments on them. ir. Stevens: Some years ago I saw planted two miles of lpa trees on contract, and I had to carry with me to show pies of fence rails that had been in use for forty yeans — ions of trees from southeast Missouri. In our own plant - we found that west of North Platte the tree is liable to v up rapidly and don't know when to quit in the fall of </seg>
            <seg id="p215">215 the year and sometimes the frost catches the ttec unripe and the tops are injured. The tree never dies, but the tops are injured. The plantations that 1 am acquainted with in the eastern portion of the state have not ■affend very materially from freezing. They have grown well and are doing well. On good soil those trees arc doing well, and are large enough now for telephone poles. On thin laud in our county the growth is rather slow and the results are nut as satisfactory. Indi - cations are that those trees ought to be planted on soil rea - sonably fertile and be given room to develop in. L'uder such conditions I would regard it as the most favorable tret- to plant for fence posts and telephone poles. A Member: What kind was that? Mr. Stephens: The Bpecioaa. It is generally agreed that we should have the BpecioM. Some years ago Honorable Robt. Douglas had a plantation at Arlington. Kansas. He was not particular with his seed at lirst and gathered it largely in the middle districts where these trees grow too late in the fall, so they killed back and he plowed them up and be - gan over again, giving particular care to the seed. All the nurserymen of my acquaintance are very careful in their se - lection of seed ; they are all endeavoring to plan! SpecioM. I understand that there is a hybrid whit-fa is known by having a great many pea-like pods. E Marshall : We have one of the leading fruit growers Hamburg, Iowa, here and 1 want to call for Mr. A. A. is, of Hamburg, Iowa, to si&gt;eak to us. Mr. Simons: Mr. President and Members: If 1 had known what I should get here I should probably have gone down stairs. I don't know what 1 can give you in the way of information. We have been in the fruit business for the last fifteen or sixteen years and have made enough out of it for our bread and butter. There is no trouble at all to make a good living out of it. This season we had very good success, DISCUSSION. </seg>

The only way to fruit is to go after it. I don't think much can be done u way of fruit growing without spraying. A fruit grower stop for expenses when he starts in. If you have any :ions to ask I will try to answer them. A Member : What was your plan of picking and packing apples and where did your apples go to? Air. Simons : in picking the apples we did not have as good luck as Mr. Marshall, we picked by the day. 1 think another year we shall follow Mr. Marshall's plan and pick by the bush - el ; 1 think that is the only way. Uur pickers didn't pick any - where near as many as Mr. Marshall's men did and it cost us in the neighborhood of ti cents a bushel to get our apples picked. In regard to selling the crop, we didn't have much trouble with that. We usually try to sell our own crop to the dealers in Nebraska. In 1907 and this last year, 1909, to our home packer our No. 1 and No. 2 grades and delivered them on the track there. Ip.

Eretary Marshall . It is in the press now, but has been up on account of some of the papers Mr. Uussell could ;et hold of. ■. Davidson : This 1909 report is over a year behind. It d have been out last fall, in September, and I think this deprives us of 50 per cent of its worth. Secretary Marshall: 1 think that is so, but I am not re - sponsible for the previous reports. I am going to try to get out this one for this year on time, but the printers have tin advantage of us. The law says they have GO days from the time the last proof is returned to them before they have to de - liver the books; they can hold up the books. We usually do not send in all the material at one time, and they can hold it up for any length of time they please until the last proof is turned in and then they have 60 days beyond that if they want it and they can keep putting us off. The man who printed the 1909 report is anxious to get it off his hands. It was over 100 days from the time the last proof was turned in until we got the first copies of the 1908 report. They were about ."»() days over the limit of 60 days, and then they would deliver from 50 to 100 reports a week. I called the company up very often, nearly every day for two weeks to ask about it, and it was several weeks before we could get enough reports to sup - ply the members. I would send out a few one week and the next week would get 50 or 100 more. We have received about 2,000 reports up to this date, but we are ahead now and will have several hundred reports on hand from now on. I want to say for Mr. Davidson's benefit that the report probably al - ways will be delayed some, but this bulletin system gets out the best of it a little quicker. </seg>

            <seg id="p221">IN MEMGRIAM J. H. MASTERS Died June 10, 1909. Age, 89 Years. Hon. James Harris Masters, the pioneer nurseryman of Ne - braska and first president of this Society, was born in Warren county, Kentucky, ten miles from Bowling Green, August 15. 1819. In 1828 the family moved to Springfield, Illinois. At the age of eighteen he learned the carpenter's trnde, which he fol - lowed in Illinois until 1853. when he moved to Atchison county, Missouri, where he grew seedlings and root grafts for the pur - pose of starting a nursery in Nebraska as soon as the govern - ment should open the land for settlement. In 1854 he moved to Nebraska and settled in Otoe county near Nebraska City, where he operated a nursery for a number of years. Mr. Masters was a charter member of the Nebraska State Hor - ticultural Society, having allied himself with the Society at the time of its organization in 1869. He was its first president and served in this capacity for eight years. He was active in the work of the Society for many years and furnished much fruit from his orchards for exhibits made by the Society at its meet - ings and at expositions outside of the state. Mr. Masters was a member of the state legislature in 1872. He was a member of the Masonic order and a life member of the American Pomological Society. He was an influential member of the Methodist church, of which he was trustee and steward for many years. He was married three times and was the father of six children, five of whom survive him. He passed away at Syracuse, Nebraska. June 10, 1909. (221) </seg>

Ks apple judging contest was held in Horticultural Hull e University Farm, Thursday afternoon, January I'K. ■five men and four women look part iu the contest, -eight winning premiums. The following plan, adopted by the Board of Directors of the Society, was tued in conducting the contest: EThe Society offers f 100 in prizes for an apple judging t, to be held at the I'niversity Farm in connection with nual meeting and fruit show of the Society. I) The contest shall be open to any regular annual or life ber of the Society in good standing who has not been a her of the Society for more than three years. (3) The prize money shall be prorated to the contestants si oring above 70 points, according to the total number of points above 70 scored by the several contestants. (For the Method of determining the score, see paragraph 9.) I) A special exhibit for the contest shall be prepared by Secretary of the Society. It shall consist of four pi of ten varieties of standard winter apples, each plate to lin five specimens. Each plate shall be correctly labeled the name of the variety except as provided in paragraph id the plates shall be numbered consecutively from 1 to By standard variety is meant any variety of winter apple nmended by the Society for any district of the state. ETn case of not less than four nor more than eight i, the exact number to be unknown to the contestants, shall be substituted for the variety named on the label variety not readily distinguished from it, to try the con - its' knowledge of varieties. (C&gt;) Three judges appointed by the Secretary shall pass upon the exhibit before the contest begins and rank each plate as first, second, third, or fourth, according to its merit, ex ( ept that in case a plate contains a variety substituted for the </seg>

The nunilMT of points assigned each quality ie score card is to be regarded as perfection for that K soundness is meant frcedoa from fungous or in- U, ltruises, withering, or other blemishes. As regard! and color, no plate shall be narked down on account of large or too highly colored fruit. (8) The contestants shall rank the 40 plates after the judges have finished and hand the Secretary a ropy of their rankings on blanks furnished by him. They shall also note all cases of substitution of varieties by number of the plate concerned, and give the correct name of the variety. They shall be given three hours in which to rank the plate* and pre - pare their report; provided that the Secretary may extend the time at his discretion. The contestants shall not be al - lowed to consult with each other nor with other i&gt;er*ons, but may refer to any standard work on descriptive pomology, and may, if they choose, use the score card given in paragraph 7. i !t i The Secretary 'shall, as soon as possible after the con test, compare the rankings of plates made, by each contestant with the rankings given by the judges and mark off for each plate as many points as there is difference between its rank- i ii' r l)v t lit' coot(*st&lt;iiit * i n*l bv t h(* ludfircs Foi* instance \f fl.

In case a substituted plate is identified but not correctly named, one-half the proportionate number of points shall be deducted. The score made by any contestant shall be determined by subtracting from 100 the number of points found against him. THE IRIS. C. S. HARRISON, YORK. Literature on the iris is meager. With the exception of an elaborate and somewhat expensive work of R. J. Lynch, of England, which is rather too scientilic for the ordinary read - er, there appears to be no work on the Iris. It is our wish to bring the subject down to the reach of all and to introduce them more fully to these remarkable flowers. J. W. Man - ning, of .Massachusetts, gave the horticulturists of that state a fine paper on the subject, probably the fullest that has bees. given in America. A VERY I.ARGK FAMILY There are about 170 native sorts. They belong mostly to the Northern Hemisphere.

Tin: ijoot system These flowers may be divided into three classes, the rhizo - matous, with rhizomes reaching out from the plant in every dine lion. These are the German ami others nearly allied to them. The bulbous have bulbs like tulips. These belong to three families, the English, Spanish, and June irises. Tli • English are called xiphioides. They grow aboat as tall as tulips, often bearing two or three (lowers to a stalk. Then - are some fine sorts among them with quite delicate and pleas - ing blossoms. The Spanish, called xiphium, are taller and stronger. These grow about two feet high and are more showy than the En - glish. Among these are numerous varieties. Some of these are natives of Italy, Algiers, and other parts of Africa. We have tried both of the above species, and while they produce delicate and charming little flowers they are not at all satis factory. If left in the ground the bsJbs deteriorate, and when we are searching for hardy perennials we want something that will take care of themselves. We would not advise any one to bother with them when there are far more hardy and beautiful types. Iie June irises also belong to the bulbous class. This is B a numerous family, with tall and dwarf as well as stem varieties. We never have tested these and would not ad - any one to do so unless they have ample means and have </seg>

They are all right in their own habitat but o not do well away from home. The most beautiful iris in the world is called Oncocvclus from Palestine. Fortunes have been spent on them.

They must be grown in frames, must be watered while (lower - ing, and as in the hot, dry climate they came from, they ate baked in the solid earth, they must have like conditions or they will die. One writer says the beds must be very hard and firm. "The Onooeyclus irises never grant any pardon for an omission of duty regarding then, and we try to leave them no excuse for being sulky on our hands.

Sometimes they seem s ravenous and reach out and devour all the nutriment in reach. The center will sometimes be starved to death there will he a vacant space, while the outside foragrm push out further and further for more nutrition. This s the need of frequent transplanting. IKIS WITH TUFTED BOOT These are of the Siberian and Japanese type and others of a kindred nature. They also increase rapidly. The Bine Si - herian is one of the hardiest in the world. We know of no plant which understands multiplication better. After grow - ing two years you have a Strong clump with heavy tops. You pull these apart bj main strength, and they subdivide into individual plants.

Nature sends out her call to the Iwe for help. Now the bee is a faithful servant and gives ready answers. ISeauty and sweetness are the lure which calls the insect. It is not the nectar alone which attracts. The beautiful color of the Bower is the Hag which invites, tell - ing where the sweets are hidden. The wanderer sees and An - swers the signal. Did you ever watch the great bumble hee as he goes from one columbine to another and creeps into the Hower for the nectar. He seems almost intoxicated with de - light. As ho goes into this storehouse he hrushes otf the pol - len with his rough coat and carries it with him as he enters the next flower. Thus he fertilizes it. lie seems to gather a tint from one and a shade from another, and when you sow the seed thus fertilized you have charming results. We have seen as nianv as fiftv different kinds from the same seeding. </seg>
            <seg id="p229">229 Many of them of rare and wooing beauty. It is so with the iris. The liee is one of nature's most faithful assistants. However, though this node of crossing may ghre you just m good results, Mm can no4 giye the parentage unless the off - spring shows some dearly defined characteristics. The scientific method is to restore the anther of the flower just before it opens to spill out the fertilising dust, and then shake it over the well-laden anthers of another flower. After this thin muslin is bound over it to keep out any insect which might bring any other pollen. The record is kept and the originator knows just what he is doing. Thus the l&gt;eautiful Queen of .May is a hybrid of three, Palida, Sambucina, ami Variegata. The resplendent Madam Chereau has for her par - ents Palida and Sambucina. One florist is crossing the early Alpine with the later flowering sorts, and he expects to pro - long the flowering season at least six months. In looking over our vast collection of over 100 varieties we are amazed at the progress which has been made, and linger with delight on these new creations of the florist. One of the charms of floriculture is the fact that any one with little care and a good deal of enthusiasm can not only raise the estab - lished sorts, but can also originate new ones, and no one can tell what glorious things he can call out of the unknown. SEE HOW IT WORKS. A little money secures one or two irises of a kind. A little attention gives rapid increase. A single root soon becomes a great clump. This is divided and you have quite a bed. Soon your dime grows to dollars and the dollars to eagles. Th-n you can plant the seeds and so enlarge your number of varic - ties. It does not take much time or much hard work. It will be a delight. And you can combine beauty and utility. The world is restless for more home adornment. Each year there are louder calls for fine flowers. You can take advantage of it, and many a woman with meager income can increase it in a large measure while she improves her health, reaping con- </seg>

Whenever grows iu i lie cold Xorth, out on the Plains, or in the South, ilie iris should have protection. It is so ethereally beautiful and so delicately fragile it should not be subjected to rough usage and the buffeting of the storms. Whenever seen in its native state it has chosen some quiet spot, some she! tend space near some pond or in one of nature's silent places where it can make that beautiful toilet without moles - tation. It is not found growing naturally in a bleak and windswept spot. In fact, all flowers should be protected. They can not be at their best when crippled and bruised by the fierce storms which sweep over the land. It is asking too much of them to go from an embowered, secluded home out into the vast bleakness of the naked prairie. A SUITABLE PROTECTION. After searching for more than thirty years for some hardy, quick-growing, and beautiful shrub which would both give ornamentation and protection, we have decided on the Loni - i-eras or Bush Honeysuckles. The spireas are beautiful when in bloom, but they are not tall enough. Lonicera Marrowi is very popular iu the East as well as in the West. It is quick - growing and is covered in springtime with a flood of sweet - scented lowers, followed by masses of bright red berries which lengthen out its attraction a long time. It is, however, of a weeping or sprawling habit which takes up a good deal of space. It is much used in rough places to cover rocks or unsightly spots, and is not so desirable for a hedge. HUPRECHTA. This is a compact, rapid-growing bush from Manchuria, and is fast coming into favor. It also is covered by a blanket of light-colored flowers, followed by masses of berries. It </seg>
            <seg id="p231">231 would take bat a short time for a splendid shelter. But we think the very best is ( 1 rand i flora Bomb Tartnrica. This is of upright habit, a rapid grower with large bright red flowers striped with white. The blooms are deliriously fragrant, the (lowers followed by large bright red berries. We can not em - phasize this matter too strongly. Every spring you will note the great difference between the protected and unprotected flowers. We have a dump of Festiva .Maxima peonies south of the house on which we have counted &lt;&gt;."&gt; large flower buds, all striv - ing to open and cover the plant with a mantle of purest white. Out in the windswept field we have 300 of the same kind, and it takes on the average 3 clumps to produce one flower. This is on account of the full sweep of the fierce northwest wind which nips the flowers in the bud. Irises open all right in the open, but they are so ethereally beautiful ; the wind soon de - spoils them of that exquisite delicacy and fragile loveliness we so much admire. A royal family would not think of buf - feting the fierce storms out in the open in full court dress. Your hedge will be in full leaf and bloom about the time many of the flowers open. First come the columbines, such an immense family — all triving to see which can attract the most attention. Like a troup of merry little girls, each coyly inviting inspection of her pretty dress, and without saying it rather hinting that hers is the finest. In that secluded spot they grow taller and the blooms are larger and more beautiful than in the open. We have had them grow four feet tall under good protection, when without it they would not be over eighteen inches. In fact, a flower to do her best should have the very best chance. Here are the bleeding hearts and how they do enjoy this quiet. Then come the glowing oriental poppies (perennials) won - derful flowers, some of them nine inches across — a bed of them like a sea of fire. They do not like such heavy headgear to be buffeted by the winds any more than a girl with her two-bushel hat would like to be eau^ht in a windstorm. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 Iien come the resplendent irises. One looks at them, espt&gt; y the newer suits, in their quiet beauty; and lasguage . They are so winsome ami ethereally delicate. The\ a hint of both worlds, presenting us with the fairest this l affords, and at the same time there is something proph - about them of beauty not yet revealed. This place is their paradise. They can put on their resplen - dent garments without the rebuke of the storms. Here they unfold all their charms. The lure of their beauty is indesciib able. While in bloom you hover over them and see that vein - ing, interweaving, and blending of tint ami shading you can not deseriln'. That iridescent glow we imagine is the smile of the dazzling goddess from which they are named. They hold and fascinate you and throw a spell over you. You go and come again. You linger and ponder in delightful rev - erie. You are seeing them at their best. They much prefer to make their toilet in seclusion than to dress in all out of doors. Here the peonies begin to bloom until that large bed is overwhelmed with them. There are the lilies, the platyco - dons, the phloxes, the stately Bocconias and Lupines. You have a full menagerie of loveliness all your own. I'hile the flowers are at their best, the hedge seems to say, w I will take a hand in this myself," and lo, it is covered i a mantle of fragrance and beauty, each bush in courtly s keeping guard over the charming wards within. The sysuckle is very fragrant — the perfume fills the arena. gling with the sweet breath of the flowers and filling all surrounding air. And you have done all this yourself. You got four hundred cuttings and planted that space and tilled it with beauty. You stand there with a higher appreciation of yourself and of your possibilities. The trouble with the average man is he uses but a small part of himself. Let him work up all his powers and reach out and take his own and he will wonder who that fellow is sad he will feel like taking off his hat to himself. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">233 PROPAGATION Th*"se flowers grow readily from seed. These should be jjathircd as soon as ripe. Some authorities say they should be sown immediately. We usually plant them early in the spring. If kept too long they appear to lose their vitality. The Japanese iris grow very rapidly and we have no trouble in raising them by the thousand. Of course they never come true to name. You get something different all the time, yet von have a chance to secure some fine ones at little cost. When you can do so it is better to plant where you want them to stand. They will usually flower in three or four years. When you want plants true to name you must divide the roots. Planted in good ground they increase very fast. You separate the rhizomes, planting one in a place as you would potatoes. If you have plenty of room put the rows three feet apart and a foot apart in the row. Your ground should be in the best of condition. Plant the top bud about two inches below the surface. If too deep they will not do so well ; If too shallow the winter may injure them. TIME OF PLANTING. |&gt;me tell us the best time is right after they have bloomed, have tried this with fair success; only the ground should rery moist so they will go right to growing. We have ited in September and in all the fall months with success. have had them in a box of moss for six months and then ited them with but little loss. But this is not the best . If planted in the fall cut at least half the tops off. er plant iris after iris any more than you would plant po - es on the same ground year after year. Peonies follow - peonies bct-onip dwarfed and diseased. We have seen most pstrous results by highly fertilizing and replanting in the e place. The rapid increase of the iris is greatly in its favor.

One is an expert with the roses. Another into raptures over the dahlia, until you ask him about its fragrance; another wants nothing but peonies; another finds phloxes all he needs. But we want them all. A well-bal - anced flower garden will have the best the world affords, and it will be incomplete if any of the successful standard flowers are wanting. And a person does not need many things that must be nursed and coddled all the time. He wants flowers that are interested in the matter themselves — that will not be too sensitive or sulky if things don't go exactly to their liking. Yet all plants have their idiosyncracies or individu. ality. One needs to study their likes and dislikes and tries to find out their preferences as he would the wishes of invited ms.

For instance, a man plants a fine lot of phloxes. He puts them on a ridge. There comes a dry time. He has not cultivated t ground and he finds them drying up.

He would have been sick himself if he had to eat a whole ox at a meal. W V get choice things and want to do the best we can by them and overdo it. A gentleman in Minnesota bought a lot of peonies. A year later he asked me to see them. I went. They were poor, dwarfed, sickly things. Said I, "I know just what you did. You dug a trench, tilled it with manure, fresh at that, then put in the roots and covered them with manure in winter. You have surfeited them. This fall take them up and pat them in a fresh piece of ground that has not been enriched lately and you will save them." I dug up one poor thing. It had the club foot. It could not possibly throw out any young roots. All the sustenance had to come through absorption from the old diseased root. In the case of irises a man will find the tops wilting and falling off the rhizome. What is the cause? Wet feet prob - ably and too much manure. Yet these perennials are hardy, and when you understand their needs and keep on the right side of them you are all right. You have two neighbors, one on each side of you. You wish to be on the best of terms with thorn, but they are entirely different and what would please one would not please the other. But you soon find out their peculiarities and treat them accordingly. Some irises, like the Japs, want wet feet at blooming time. The same treat - ment would not suit the German varieties. The Achorus family and many of our wild native sorts will bloom in water, a condition which would rot other kinds. SOME OF THE BEST KINDS FOR BEOINNERS.

STEPHENS, fUKTt THE OUCUAK1 The old orchard, that is, trees twelve to fifteen years old and older and already in bearing, will be benefited by be applications of stable litter or other fertilizer. To the extent that stable litter can he procured, we have been in the habit of using about SOO pounds for cadi tree of the age of fifteen years and upward. This litter distributed about the tree, never in contact with the trunk, increases the stock of hiiinus in the soil, lessens the winter evaporation and injury from dry freezing. I the last two years we have hauled in some three million ids of stable litter or manure from the town stables and : -yards. Careful observation for thirty years indicates lefit of -*1 per load for each of the first two years follow - he application, and that the beneficial effect is not wholly during a period of eight rears. We prefer to use stable r rather than straw to the extent that we can secure the &gt;. An application of three inches of stable litter is better ten or twelve inches of straw. Where stable litter can not be had in sufficient quantities to mulch the row to a width of eight or ten feet, straw sta&lt; ks may be used to excellent advantage. The hauling of stable litter and straw is suitable work for the Tiionths of December and January. Where the application of litter and straw is confined to the width of eight or ten feet, and the remaining portion of the ground between the rows kept under annual </seg>

RABBITS. Khliits usually do little harm to an orchard after it has at - il the age of eight or ton years, but orchards recently ed and orchards up to the age of perhaps eight years d receive protection. In our branch orchards we have I about 25,000 wooden veneers. These veneers, costing $5 thousand, can be tied about the young trees and form a protection against rabbits during the first three or four s after planting. If the veneers are of excellent quality may perhaps last four years. Where it is not convenient to secure veneers, we have pro - d thousands of trees by the use of cornstalks. ( \it a suit - able number of cornstalks of a length of 24 to 30 inches. Tie top and bottom to the trunk of the tree. The gradual decay of the cornstalk allows the tree room to expand, and it is rarely necessary to take the trouble to go around and cut them loose, as they will ordinarily rot out and drop away. We have also used slough grass and rye straw. Tn case the number of fruit trees to be protected is so large that it is not convenient to tie up each tree, then it is well to remember that the rabbit has a sensitive nose and can be kept away by applying a combination of blood, soap, and tobacco juice, nsins a swab. Sometimes we have added red pepper, crude carbolic acid, or any other offensive ingredient. The &lt;&gt;f a slijht amount of flour in the combination makes it more adhesive and less liable to wash off. Iie cheapest tobacco can be procured in the form of leaf s from the eigarmaker. We steep these tobacco stems then to that add the blood, soap, and any other incrredi - convenience may suggest to use. This will be less dis - cahle to apply, if used while warm, otherwise it is a cold &gt;n a chilly day. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">239 E.y thousands of trees are annually lust from the depre. - s of rabbits, and trees cms be protected at a ten cent per tree. ' I'lUMNG. While the commercial orchardist will commence work dur - ing the sunny days of December, beeaaae lit- has m many trees, it will take the whole winter to prune his orchard. the farmer or planter who has only a family orchard should defer pruning until March, the reason therefor being that if pruning is done just before active circulation of sap starts in the spring, the cut surface dries and checks less and the wound heals over more quickly. In pruning, in the case of young trees, start the tree with a sufficient number of branches to make a rather open head. In season to season prune sufficiently to keep the head of rae well balanced and reasonably open. A tree with an head can be sprayed more thoroughly than when the is allowed to grow at will. It is usual to cut out the ers or water sprouts, the dead wood, and the broken branches. It should lx&gt; remembered that the cherry tree require! rerj little pruning. The cherry is more sensitive to the loss of wood or the cutting away of any portion of its top than other varieties of fruit trees and rarely requires more pruning than to remove the branches which interfere with each other by croaring. Kum trees require comparatively little pruning. In the of young trees, shorten in the strongest shoots which oat - ■ the others to the extent of unbalancing the form and netry of the tree. Considerable amount of pruning might be done in the month of June, if there wen' at that season of the year time for the work. The average planter, however, finds the season crowded so full of duties that he must prune in winter or not at all. </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 THE VINEYARD. While the grapevine is reasonably hardy throughout south - ern Nebraska, yet the aridity of oar winters is such that there is a lessened evaporation, and a stronger and more vigorous vine if, in our trying climate, it can receive some winter pro - tection. In case the winters should be very, very dry, there is danger of root killing. In the vineyards belonging to the late ex-Governor Furnas at Hrownville, sonic years ago, ten thousand vines were lost by root killing; this by reason of a severely cold and very dry winter. Therefore, we have found it well to trim our vineyards each autumn. The fruit next year is formed on the new wood of the present season's growth. The object of pruning is to shorten the new growth, leaving approximately the amount of fruiting wood which the vine can safely carry. It will be found wise to shorten the laterals to three, four or five buds, depending on the va - rieties and to some extent on the age and vigor of the vine. The buds left on the laterals develop next season's fruit. The main canes are shortened to suitable length, depending also on the age and vigor of the vine. Kter pruning, we cut the vines loose from the trellis, drop on the ground, put two or three forksful of straw over vine and over that place sufficient amount of soil to keep traw from blowing away. K would figure the expenditure of three cents per vine as sufficient for pruning, hauling the Rtraw, covering and ting the vineyards for winter. MULCHING THE SMALL FRUIT PLANTATION. Currants, gooseberries, raspberries, and blackberries should be very heavily mulched before winter. Stable litter is usu - ally the most convenient for mulching currants and goose - berries. For many years we have used straw in the raspberry and blackberry plantations. In these plantations we allow the straw to remain on the rows the entire season with the </seg>
            <seg id="p241">241 result that it checks the growth of weeds, and retains the moisture for the benefit of the plantation. Since adopting this method we have never failed to secure a crop of fruit. About the time the ground commences to freeze, the straw - berry plantation should be thoroughly covered with old hay. Why? Because old hay is free from weed seed. A covering of an inch is sufficient. In very windy districts it is some - times necessary to confine this covering by occasional weights I.st it should be blown off by high winds, but after it is matted down it usually sticks the winter through. We have often - times used stable litter, preferably litter from stables where prairie hay was fed. Not wise to use litter from stables where clover is fed, since it is liable to result in a considerable amount of clover springing up within the plantation. Fail - ing to get either hay or stable litter, use straw, selecting that which is as free as possible from weed seeds. HOMK (iUOlM'S, ORXAMKXTAL SHRUBBERY. At this season of the year it is not difficult to collect a great quantity of leaves. Leaves have been blown into ditches and sheltered places and can be gathered very rapidly. They will l&gt;e found very useful as a covering about ornamental shrub - liery, roses and bulbs, one of Nature's own and best pr&gt; A heavy mulch of leaves or fine litter will be found a great protection to the root system of ornamental plants. In Ne - braska our winters are likely to be very dry and this soil cover lessens the soil evaporation and the danger that the ground will freeze dry during the winter. ROSES. ti roses and half hardy roses may be protected by first ng a mound of earth, sod or other material over which nd the rose bush. Over this florists usually cover with In many places sods can be procured, and a covering ds will not blow away. </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 Tea roses may also be cut back half, leaving them perhaps U to 18 inches in height. They may then be boxed in and cowered with leaves or fine chatty straw or old hay. With i mount of protection they usually winter safely. Ii excellent method of growing tea roses is to make a bor - loti feet in width by 6 to 8 feet in length, according to rounds. A border of this character will contain 15 to 20 , giving a choice assortment of varieties. This border be surrounded by boards 12 inches high and filled in with s or short straw, giving adequate protection. In exposed and trying locations it is oftentimes judicious to take down climbing roses, wrap in burlap, or cover on the ground with leaves, old hay. or litter to lessen the trying evaporation of our wintry winds. It is apparent to any one that the animal which has a comfortable stable during tb* 1 winter conies oat in better condition in the spring than tue one exposed to winds of winter. While Dor hardiest varieties of roses may endure the evap - oration of our trying winters, they will, however, come through stronger and give better results the coming season if they can receive a fair measure of protection during the winter. In the springtime the soil protected by a suitable mulch will be found in much better condition than that which has been exposed to the evaporation of our trying winters. THE LAWN The lawn needs shelter during the winter. First it should have a considerable growth of its own grass allowed to remain through the winter instead of being cut late in the fall by the lawn mower. Second, a mulch of any vegetable matter, leaf mold, leaves, rich manure, applied in early winter, will pro - the grass roots from the trying, arid winter's cold and bring the lawn through in condition to give a much more vig - orous growth of grass the coining season. I noticed today that about our office where the grass has never been cut short late in the fall that we have a much better sod than about the </seg>
            <seg id="p243">243 residence where the lawn mower has been run a month or six \v&lt;i-ks later than is judicious. FALL PLANTING It sometimes happens the planter has more leisure for planting in late autumn than in early spring, during which season he is rushed with the seeding of farm crops. In caae the ground has a suitable amount of moisture, or water can be conveniently s&lt;t ured to make it sufficiently moist, then certain varieties of small fruits may be planted in late au - tumn. We have found that grapevines planted in early No - vember, after the wood was well ripened and matured, made a stronger growth the succeeding season than when planted in the springtime. We, however, always take the precaution to heavily mulch, cover, and bury each vine so planted. Raspberries and blackberries may be planted at the same on and the currant also, if heavily mulched and thor - oughly protected. It is rarely wise in Nebraska to plant fruit trees, shade trees, or forest trees in the fall, since under ordinary orchard or field conditions there is too great risk that the trees may ■offer from drying out before the opening days of spring. It is legitimate, however, to dig the trees in the fall of the year and bury them root, body, and branch, carrying them over the winter in readiness for early spring planting. Tens of thousands of trees are lost every year by planters who re - ceive trees and simply heel them instead of burying the tree root, body, and branch. In the case of fall planting or fall burying of trees it is wise to have trees and plants properly and thoroughly ripened before digging. </seg>

            <seg id="p245">245 SPRAYING IN NEBRASKA The aim in preparing this circular is to place in the hands of farmers and others who are growing fruit for the bone supply a simple guide to follow in lighting the more trouble - some of the insects and frugal diseases that infest our Ne - braska orchards. It is not necessary at this time to go inio detail as to the life histories of these peats, or to take up and discuss at length the advantage of fighting them. The fact that our orchards are infested with these pests confronts us and the question is how to successfully combat them with the least trouble and expense. We are not so much concerned about how they came into the country and how they are perpetu - ated as we are about how and when they work and the sprays to use in fighting them successfully. A few suggestions, however, as to the objects of spraying and the results to be obtained may not be amiss. The necessity of making this phase of the orchard work a part of the plan in carrying out the details connected with growing of good fruit has been emphasized by the many ex - periment fetation publications and by the agricultural press In general. It is recognized by the up-to-date fruit grower and farmer as a feature of the work connected with success - ful fruit culture that is just as important as cultivation and pruning. In fact, the commercial apple grower in main tions would rather dispense with, for a single season, either cultivation or pruning or both than with spraying. It has been proven beyond a question that apples may he kept almost absolutely free of insects and fungus (Use by proper spraying when fruit on adjoining rows not sprayed will be practically worthless as a result of the presence of worms and scab.

            <seg id="p247">247 By spraying the grower not only produces clean fruit, but he keeps his trees in a healthier condition. Apples do not drop immaturely as a result of diseased stems, and a full crop is matured. The fruit when stored keeps much better, being comparatively free of disease germs that cans;- rot, and there are few insect and disease blemishes through which these germs may enter the fruit should there be any present. It is also noted that sprayed trees resist late spring frosts better than unsprayed trees. Begnlar spraying keeps the trees in a healthy, vigorous condition so that stronger and more ma - ture fruit buds are formed. Then at blooming time applica - tions of spray mixtures seem to aid the buds and dowers in resisting frosts. In corroboration of the above conclusions the following is quoted from an address by Professor J. C. Whitten, horti - culturist at the University of Missouri, before the Nebraska State Horticultural Society: "At times certain fungi may do more damage to the tree direct than to the fruit which is being produced by it. Per- Ii a specific example may emphasize this point better than be done in any other way. In my own state during the three springs, for example, we have had prolonged cold, i or less frosty weather during the blossoming period of apple trees. In sections of the state more or less blast - »f the flowers at this season has taken pla&lt; e, so that buds and there fail to set well. The almost unanimous ver - of the orchard ists has been that in sections where apples ■d to set, even though there was a full bloom, that the fail - has been due to the fact that the blossoms were killed by , frosty weather. "It is my opinion that the failure of apple blossoms t&lt;&gt; fruit, and the dropping of these small apples shortly after they set, has been due more largely to the presence of 'apple scab' in the orchard than to cold weather. In one large or - chard adjacent to the Experiment Station, which is not </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 erally affected with 'apple scab.' The stem of the flower in many cases turned black, wilted, then withered, and the flower fell because the parasitic fungi, 'apple scab,' had a foothold in the flower cluster, and not directly because the weather was cold enough to kill the blooms through frost. ILgain, when sprayed trees are compared with unsprayed i right in the same orchard, where all experienced the t cold weather, the flower clusters are mainly killed on i that are not sprayed, and apples that are sprayed escape cold and subsequently mature, and because the 'apple " also is kept out of the trees, this is still better evidence it is not the cold weather but the 'apple scab' that killed lowers when spraying was not done. "In our experiment station orchard during the present sea - son a full crop of Jonathan, Ben Davis, Gano, Ingram, Wine - sap, and other leading commercial varieties was secured on trees which went through the same cold weather as was ex - perienced by adjacent unsprayed trees whose bloom or young fruit was mostly killed before the warm weather of spring came on. An outlying experiment was performed on an adjacent orchard. This orchard embraces some 200 acres of Jonathan, Ben Davis, Gano, and other commercial sorts. Be - lieving from the previous year's observations that the loss of flowers was due to 'scab' rather than to cold weather, a single in this orchard was sprayed carefully by the Experiment Si ;u ion. This one acre had more good marketable fruit on it this autuiuu than all of the rest of the 200 acres combined. While the cold weather was apparently killing the blossoms ou uusprayed trees (which blossoms, however, were actually bring killed by 'apple scab') fruit was setting nicely on sprayed trees when' 'apple si -alt' was kept down, and a good crop was the result." COST OF SPRAYING The cost of spraying depends chiefly on the age and size of the trees to be sprayed. In blocks of apple trees in Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p249">249 orchard* containing from 3D to 150 trees (about the size of tin- average home orchard) ranging in age from 12 to 30 jean, where the c&lt;Mt of all material and labor used in spray - ing has been accounted for, the total cost per tree for each application was from 4 to 8 cents. These trees were spraye»l four or live times, making a total cost for the season of from 20 t &lt; » 40 cents per tree. All labor and team hire was charged at i he rate paid for such services in the locality. According to the above figures, the cost of spraying the average home orchard of 100 trees rive times would be about $30. Of this cost the material for making the mixtures would amount to $ 12 to $ 15 and the labor in mixing and applying to from $15 to $18. Where the owner does not hire the work done the actual outlay of money should not exceed $ 18 to $20. The actual time consumed by two men in mixing and apply - ing the sprays should not exceed one day for each application. Large orchards can be sprayed proportionately, considerably cheaper. One and sometimes two of the five applications, according to the prevalence of insects and fungus diseases, may be dis - pensed with in Nebraska. This, of course, would cut the cost down accordingly. COST OP MATERIAL Recent quotations from manufacturers and jobbers of blue - stone and arsenate of lead are: for bluestone $4.50 to $5 per Lit pounds; for arsenate of lead, in quantities, 7 to 9 cents per pound. Where this material is bought of the local deal - ers in small lots the purchaser will usually be asked to pay from 25 to 50 per cent more than the prices quoted above. Lime is quoted at fl to $1.25 per barrel of 200 pounds.

Power outfits can be bought for from |200 to 1300. PREPARING BORDEAUX MIXTURE. Bordeaux is made by combining a solution of bluestone and me, each properly diluted. Mixtures of varying strengths, ending on the trees and plants to be sprayed and the stage evelopment of buds, leaves, and fruit, are used. A standard formula for Bordeaux is Bluestone (sulphate of copper) 4 pounds Unslaked lime 4 pounds Water 50 gallons Where only a small amount of Bordeaux is needed the blue - stone may be dissolved in warm water and enough water added to make 26 gallons; and the lime slaked in a separate Teasel and diluted to 25 gallons. The two solutions should then be combined by running a stream of equal volume from each into a separate vessel, or by dipping with pails from each solution and pouring both into the third vessel at the same time. Ea considerable amount of Bordeaux is needed it is make up stock solutions of bluestone and lime, which p indefinitely if kept covered, to prevent evaporation </seg>

These may be prepared in the following man - ner : Place 30 or 40 pounds of bluestone in a flour sack and suspend, slightly below the surface of the water, in a barrel containing as many gallons of water as pounds of bluest one med. In another barrel place an equal amount of water and add as many pounds of unslaked lime as gallons of water are and. Keep it well stirred while the lime is slaking. tiuake .10 gallons of Hordeaux of a 4-4-50 formula stir ock solutions thoroughly and take 4 gallons from each, ig it in separate half-barrels. Add water to fill each arrel and combine the two solutions by pouring them taneously into a third barrel, which may be the "spray I." When the mixture is placed in the "spray barrel" lk it should be strained through a fine screen to catch irticles that might clog the nozzles. A handy strainer can be made by fitting a short piece (6 to 10 inches long) of one to two inch gaspipe in a hole bored in the bottom of a large wooden pail. This pipe should bo fitted to one side of the center of the bottom and extend up into the pail about an inch. Window screen folded to four thicknesses should then be placed in the pail, the edges of the screen extending upward against the wall of the pail on the inside, leaving the screen concave in shape with the center resting on the bottom of the pail. Bordeaux is not effective against insects, but is used against plant diseases. Where a spray effective against both diseases and insects is desired, as for apple orchards, a com - liination spray is made by adding some form of arsenic to Rordeaux. Arsenate of lead is found to be the most desirable poison to use on apple trees. SPRAYING THE APPLE ORCHARD The apple is by far the most important of the fruits grown in Nebraska. It is also the fruit that is the most persistently attacked by insects and fungous diseases, principally codling- Tin &gt;t Ji *i ii (1 "*i ititlo Sf a Y\ " I*'oi* tlic^i* T*i**i sorm t Tif* ftTio^OY^it ion s </seg>

The following suggestions u to the mixtures to use he time to make each application are as given by those have done considerable spraying in .Nebraska. FlBR SI'Uaying. — Tlie tirst application is made when the cluster buds open, but before the individual flower buds have &lt;»]M-ued (usually late in April or early in May). This appli - cation is directed mainly against apple scab and a 4-1-30 formula of Bordeaux should be used. Should there be i cut any leaf-eating caterpillar's at this time poison may be adtled to the Bordeaux. In applying, a high pressure should be maintained so that the spray material is transformed into a line mist. The Vermorel type of nozzle does good work. &lt; 'are should be exercised to see that every part of the tree is coated with the mixture. Second Spraying. — This application is made just after the petals fall (usually from the 10th to loth of May). If the orchard is large it is well to begin this spraying as soon as the ground begins to appear white from falling petals. This is really the most important application against apple scab and the very most important against codling-moth, the parent of the "apple worm." A 3-3-50 formula of Bordeaux with about 2 pounds of arsenate of lead is used. It is important that this spraying be done immediately after the petals fall and before the calyx closes so that the poison may be encased in every calyx cup. A large percentage of the worms enter the apple through the calyx end. and by applying the poison iK'fore the calyx lobes close together the poison is held intact until it is readied by the worm starting to enter the apple. A {pressure should be maintained and a somewhat coarser le used, giving the tree a thorough drenching. At this most of the calyx cups extend upward, and for this rea - the mixture should he directed downward as much as ible. </seg>

Ik* date to make each application varies with the seasons, the grower should be governed by the development of the and bloom rather than by any dates mentioned. The directions for spraying as set forth, if carefully carried out. are sufficient ordinarily to insure healthy trees and dean fruit in Nebraska. Occasionally other insects and disease*, not controlled by these mixtures, make themselves sufficiently troublesome to demand attention, and different sprays are required. The grower is then requested to apply to this ciety for directions for fighting the particular pest. NOTES FUOM THE YORK EXPERIMENT STATION. BY C. 8. HARBISON. ORNAMENTAL HEDGES. In this wind-swept country it is necessary to have pro - tection as soon as possible both for the vegetable and lover garden. It is pitiful to see peonies, columbines, oriental poppies, phloxes, and irises buffeted, cuffed, and lashed by the tierce, drying winds which sometimes tear along in their malice at the rate of forty or fifty miles an hour. B'lants and flowers seem almost human in their effort* to tify the home and please the owner. They should have 'ction as well as the horse and the cow. I 'Hack to the land" is the cry, and it is a good healthy cry.

From The National Horticulturist, April, 1910 Reference to the newspaper literature of more than half a century ago which was devoted to the description of the new "Territory of Nebraska" shows that there were two things that impressed most strongly the minds of the writers — the lioundlessneRs of the ocean-like expanse of the prairies and the enormous quantities of wild fruit that grew in prodigal profusion along every watercourse in the eastern half of the new territory. The pioneers found that the wild plums, nr.ipes, crabapples, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, etc. which grew in such abundance were finer flavored, larger, iind in everv wav better than the wild fruits found in other 9 </seg>

General Fremont said : I he beat indications of the richness of the Nebraska river tte river) country is the luxuriance and prodigality of fruits, found growing wherever there is the slightest pro - m of trees. Our men gathered and enjoyed more than ty different varieties of plums and grapes, all very much than any we had ever before seen.

Kneral Dodge, in one of his reminiscences of the building e Union Pacific railroad, said: ••We were seldoinlv without an abundant supply (if some of wild fruit daring the time we were working in Ne - braska, throughout the season from June till September, ami from the .Missouri river to the Kocky mountain foothills.

The fruit was piled on the tables with such prodigality that little of the white cloth covering could be seen in a side view. &lt; 'learly defined color schemes were followed in the arran^t- - ment of the displays on all of the tables. On the central one, showing the name, a deep border of light Grimes Golden and Greenings served as a frame for the fruit mosaic it sur - rounded. Unfortunately the number of prizes possible to be awarded was greatly reduced by the sacrifice of varieties to carry out the beautiful artistic color scheme designed by the artists who arranged the exhibit. Nebraska might easily have added a hundred varieties, all prize winners, but the many colors would have spoiled the beautiful picture. If the jud^ had been guided by the opinion so universally express4&gt;d by the delighted visitors, the Nebraska exhibit would have won many more of the big prizes than were accorded. Each apple was a perfect specimen of its kind, without a blemish, and colored by the subtle chemistry of the sun into the richest offering that a well-cared for tree could give its master. A « omparison of all of the varieties shown indicated that they measured up fully to the best rating for same varieties gram under the perfect conditions and skillful care of the worlds standards from the northwestern apple districts, proving that Nebraska apple growers can produce as fine grade fruit, in favorable years, as the best grown elsewhere. The principal exhibits were made by the Nebraska State Horticultural Society and were awarded some of the beal prizes offered by the national congress. These included the beautiful solid silver cup offered by the Council Bluffs Grape Growers' Association for the best general display of fruit made by any State ITorticultural Society.

Ittry horticulturist realizes that, next to sunlight, water ie most important factor in plant life. But perhaps we ot realize that water is also, in many ways, a most pecu - and almost unique substance among the constituents of •rlobe. Let us note some of these peculiarities: 1st. Irs Amiiixt. — When the cooling and shrinking earth </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 finally settled into its present corrugated surfaee of moun - tain, plain, and ocean basin, and the waters of the rested in the depressions thus famed, there proved to be enough water to fill these basins to a depth of six miles in the deepest places aixl to cover just about three-quarters of the Burface of the globe. Now if there had been a little more water in the make-up of our planet, so as to give a depth of seven miles in place of six. the habitable regions of our planet would have Ix-en reduced to a few islands in the mountainous regions of the earth; if there had been still a little more, no life &lt;-ould have developed on the earth of a higher type than that of the deep-sea fishes. If, on the other hand, there had been a little less water, the earth would have beea an extended land surface with only here and then- an inland sea. and the greater part of it would have been an arid waste like certain inland districts of the larger continents today. 2d. The points of melting and evaporation for water hap - pen to lie within the ordinary range of terrestrial tempera - tures, so that water is continually changing back and forth from liquid to vapor and from vapor to liquid again, a most admirable device for supplying water to crops of continental extent. Prof. Percival Lowell, who has made so extensive a study of the planet Mars, and who has urged so strongly its probable habitability, points out the fact that on Mars it is apparently very difficult for water to reach the point of con - densation, that precipitation is therefore difficult and rare, and for this reason the water problem for vegetation on Mars is a serious one. 3d. Water is one of the few substances in nature that ex - pands a little just at the point of solidifying; hence in the process of freezing the crystals formed become slightly lighter than the water in which they pre immers&lt;»&lt;l. They therefore float instead of settling to the bottom, and the ice crust thus formed protects the water below from being deeply frozen. </seg>
            <seg id="p263">263 would settle to the bottom M fast as they formed, all our lakes and rivers and much of the oceaa would freeze solid from bot - tom upwards, and, once frozen, would only melt a little at the top during the wanner months of the year, to be again quickly frozen solid when the cold nights of autumn returned. 4th. Water has great specific heat, the greatest of all known substances; thai is. it requires more heat to raise a pound of water one degree in temperature than it does for any other substance: and conversely, the cooling of water require* it to yield up a corresponding amount of heat energy. 1 fence lakes and oceans heat and cool but slowly, thereby greatly moder - ating the climate of adjacent lands. The Great Lake region, although much farther north than Nebraska, and its average temperature considerably lower, is ;i fruit-growing district because its extremes of temperature are almost never gi ir&gt;th. Water has great latent heat of vaporization. It takes Kifi times as much heat to vaporize a mass of water, that is, o change it from water at 212 degrees Fahr. to vapor at 212 legrees as it does to raise it from 211 degrees to 212 degree*. lence evaporation keeps temperature down even much mom han the mere presence of water does. &lt; '(inversely, the con - lensation of water vapor into water requires the surrender if an equally large amount of heat ; otherwise rain would fall ■ torrents over and near the ocean, Imt would rarely get very ar from it. Even as it is, our inland position gives us none oo large a share of the world's rainfall. (ith. Water lias great latent heat of melting. It requires 143 times as much heat to change it from ice at 32 degrees Fahr. to water at 32 degrees as it does to raise it from 32 de - grees to 33 degrees. Otherwise ice on every warm winter day would melt almost instantaneously and would rush away in torrents. In view of these six facts it is not too much to say that if our chief fluid on the earth were not water, onr weather would be a series of catastrophes. It is in view of facts like these that the problems of agri- </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 culture and horticulture in an inland region like Nebraska are somewhat peculiar. Our range of temperature is great and our extremes of temperature inconstant and uncertain; our rainfall is apt to be scant and our constant of evapora lion high ; our atmospheric humidity is small and often strains to the utmost the ability of the plant tissues to pump up rater from the soil fast enough to meet the demands of the luga of the plant. How different must be the problems of the farm, the garden, the orchard, and the park in Nebraska from what they are, for example, on the California coast, where, as at San Diego, the average temperature of the six months of summer differs from that of the other six months bv only eight degrees. Evidently each region must work out its own salvation. There is no use in trying to do the iaipoa - sible. and fortunately there is no need of it; there are plenty of things that we can grow and we must tind out what they are. It is all very well to consult the catalogs of eastern nur - s&lt;r\ men and florists and to enthuse over the glowing descrip - tions of bloom and fruitage on their home grounds. We would all like to fill our front yards with the moisture-loving shrubs and flowers that we learned to love in our old homes farther east ; but for the most part our labor would be in vain. Sometimes a tenderfoot can become inured to the West and make a valuable citizen ; but we must test him carefully be - fore we trust him very fully. In this problem of the West, it seems to me that science and experience must cooperate. The horticulturist should ■tudy somewhat attentively the facts and truths which ni&lt;-t&lt; - orology has to present. Our Experiment Stations should. I think, give more attention than they are doing to the relation of atmosphere and water, heat and cold, sunshine and evap - oration, to the particular fruits and crops which we are try - ing to select as the best for a particular locality. And by meteorology I do not refer merely to the gathering of climatic data, for this has already been pretty thoroughly done, but to dirtinot lines of experimentation such as might point the </seg>
            <seg id="p265">265 way to improved methods of agriculture and horticulture. Meteorology has often pointed out new fields of &lt; onquewt. I well remember, when the questiou of Nebraska as a possible ragw heet country ni first mooted, how Professor Nichol - son came down to Douc College, which was then the head quarters of the Nebraska Weather Service cf volunteer ob - &gt;. rvi is. to find out by consulting our weather records whether or m&gt;t our climatic conditions resembled those of regions like southern France where the sugar beet was known to thrivr. It was found that they did, and so an important new indus - try was added to our somewhat meager list. So should th - work of the meteorologist in observing and studying our at - mospheric conditions, and the work of the grower in testing I he iM'havior of new varieties under these conditions, go hand in band.

It will l&gt;e of interest to briefly review a few of the ods employed in the past.

Twelv fifteen years ago screens made of laths were used to cover trees in Florida. Although the laths were an inch and a half a part, they afforded considerable protection from front by confining the warm layer of air to the earth.

Heginning with tin- spring of 11J07. the use of oil ami roal for heating orchards of apples and other decidaoM fruits has become very popular in Colorado. At some of the more fa - mous centers of that state, notably at Grand Junction, the temperature at the time apples are in bloom will sometimes fall several degrees below the freezing point. Bj the use of orchard heaters, burning either coal dr crude oil. it is claimed thai the temperature can be raised eight, ten, or even twelve degrees. To accomplish such results it is aeccssarj to ase the boners at the rate of 100 to the acre and to heat large - areas at the same time. Dangerous eold there often sets in as early as nine or ten o'clock in the evening, and may last until daylight or even sunup the next morning. However, with all these odds against them, the fruit grow - ers during the past spring (1969) united and combatted the elements all night for five nights, and every newspaper reader is familiar with the details of their brilliant success in saving their crop of apples, amounting to almost 4.000 cars. In this instance both oil and coal Darners were used. Ft is becoming popular to speak of these as "smudge pots," but this is mis - leading. While the burners do furnish a great amount of smoke which has considerable worth as a smudge, their chief value lies in the heat that they generate. The tires actually warm the air, and it is only by keeping them going thai it is kept warm. However, if there is a slight movement of the air. the smoke will drift along at no great height, and in such an instance helps to prevent the escape of the heat, and thus </seg>

Beginning ten or twelve years ago saradgiag was employed on several different occasions. Smoke was generated by burning tar, barnyard manure, and other refuse. As a rule it was impossible to get the smoke to hnag over the orchard for a sufficient length of time to have any appreciable effect in preventing the escape of heat radi - ated from the earth. Fires were built on the windward side of the orchard when there was any movement of the air, and </seg>

At other times movable tires were made by piling 1 in a wagon and building upon the mass a tire of smoul - lg material. P&gt;v moving from place to place the smoke distributed where it seemed to be most needed. Ry the most &lt; onscientious work it seemed impossible to raise the temperature more than a degree or two, even under the most favorable conditions. Three years ago a test was made of the value of retined oil i kerosene i m a means of creating a smudge and for gener - ating heat for warming the orchard. Porous bricks were soaked in the oil, and when stood on end and lighted would burn for almost an hour. Not enough smoke was far led to !»• of any practical value as a smudge, and the flames pro - duced by the burning bricks were too small to exert much in - fluence upon the temperature. However, by using the burn - ing bricks at the rate of about 100 per acre there was i r in the temperature of one or two degrees, but only for a short time, as it was found impossible to keep a sufficient number of bricks burning lively at the sain.- time and continued long enough. This experiment was tried in the apple orchard and our best efforts could not prevent the formation of frost. On the next night when there was a still heavier frost an attempt was made to protect a peach orchard. On this occa - sion coal tar was used to supplement the kerosene. Various devices were resorted to to generate heat and smoke from the two combustibles mentioned. Ry pouring tar over excelsior a dense smoke was created and considerable smoke was formed. I'.ut perhaps the best success attended the use of tar in tin cans which were set upon the kerosene-saturated bricks. Tin- latter upon being lighted furnished enough heat to boil the tar. which soon ignited and burned fiercely. These fires were kept up during the hours of early morning, and for the most part where the tires were well distributed the fruit ill saved. At this time the jM-aches were half an inch long and </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 at their most tender stage. Owing to the irregular diatribu - lion of the tires and the limited area over which they extended at all systematically, it was impossible to secure any reliable ieni|K-rature readings. At point* where trees were sur - rounded by tires the temperature at times was raised as much ;is live or six degrees, lint it did not remain constant. ciKCHAKIi HEATING KXPERIMKNTS. Last spring we experimented for the first time with a pat - ent orchard heater. We used the Troulinan oil pots holding • gallon each. The fuel was what is known as fuel oil. Where seventy of these pots t&lt;&gt; the acre were used in an apple orchard, the temperature was raised as much as three and Mm- half degrees, lmt where KM) to the acre were employed, the air was made as much as eight degreea warmer than other parts of tlie orchard where there were no heaters, lmt the trees in the latter case were planted much closer than in the former. Iiis experiment showed that the pots were of practical •. and that the temperature in an orchard under ordi - conditions could he raised materially. However, it Id be remembered that results secured from heating small &lt; are not to lie compared with the results that might be tned where large areas are heated, because the more heat - hat are used in a district al the same time the easier it l&gt;c to keep up the temperature. The effect is cumulative. I he fuel oil used was donated by one of the big oil com - ics, and the price quoted for the material was six cents gallon in barrel lots f. o. b. St. Louis. Later, quotations i secured from another oil company at five cents per gal - f. o. b. Kansas &lt; ity to be delivered in the company's tanks. &lt; very probable that it could be secured at much better res if the demands were sufficient. In Colorado the fruit growers use what is known as a "smudce oil " which is the crude nrodnct with the crasoline ■ _ nillt.ll 10 iu&lt; »_IUUC piWIUV.1 TT liu wav. (,«».,. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">271 Ked. This costs them from 2'- to 3 1 -. cents per gallon k cars. Under Missouri renditions it will be in ussaij to use on the avenge one-half gallon per pot per night or with 108 to the acre, | total of ."&gt;&lt;) gallons of oil per nij;lit. This will be siiHicient for protecting against the ordinary spring fi where the temperature only falls to the danger point late in •h&lt;- night. Sometimes, however, severe freezes occur in late spring, when it will he necessary to lighi the tires as earl 11 o'clock in the evening. In this event it would require a gallon of oil and sometimes more to last daring the remain - der of the night. It will seldom lie necessary to use the heat - ers more than two or three nights in the year. In an abnormal -"ti it will be necessary to use them three or four nights. If they wen- used for two nights during the first year the to - tal cost for the pots and oil would amount to only about per acre. The pots should last at le-st five years, so that the Iiequeni cost per year per acre would lie very light when [tared with the value of saving a crop. The figures q noted assume that the fruit growers will know when to light the tires and that they will not l&gt;e lighted unless necessary. If the tires were lighted when it is unn there would lie a considerable waste of oil. In fact some in - stances have come under my own observation where fruit growers attempted to use smudges made of brush and rel and they invariably started the tires too soon, and as a &lt;•&lt;■ qoence the fuel was all consumed and the heat and smoke lost before the danger ]&gt;oint of cold was reached. TKMl'KltATIltK DANt.KK POINTS FOB PEACHES Ehe life of the peach bud there are four Stages at which op may be lost because of injury from cold. The first is that of the fully dormant buds as we find them in winter.

            <seg id="p272">272 below for some considerable time there might be some injury, l.ut it should be remembered that the average peach tree con - tains about 23,000 buds, whereas 1,000 peaches to the tree would constitute a heavy crop. It will thus be seen that a large number of buds may be killed and yet a full crop re - main. At a temperature of zero or a little below, many of the weaker buds may perish and at eight or nine below there will be a wholesale slaughter, so to speak, although there is no reason why a sufficient number may not remain under nor - mal conditions to furnish a full crop of fruit. It second stage when injury may occur is from the time th in the buds begins until they arc fully open. This is itical period, as severe weather is apt to occur at this '. At this time the buds are much more tender than when dormant. The temperature that will kill at this time depend upon the stage of development of the buds. E&gt; third stage i* tin* time which intervenes between the og of the flowers and until the petals fall. This is the when late frosts are apt to occur. They are now very r. At this point the danger point lies somewhere be - ll and 30 degrees above zero F. The fourth and last stage Uegins after the fruit has set and lusts until all danger of cold weather has passed. Just after the fruit has formed and at the time when the "shuck'" or calyx is beginning to fall, the young fruits can stand a tem - perature of 32 degrees, and beyond this stage the larger the l&gt;ea&lt;hes are the less cold they can withstand without injury. It may Ik* repeated that the farther along the peaches are in their development the more tender they are. Briefly summarized, fully dormant peach buds can stand B or 9 degrees below zero. When they are appreciably swol - len zero is the danger point. When the buds are .showing pink they can stand 15 degrees above zero. When the buds are almost open, 25 degrees is the danger point.

I very considerable item of expense in using the oil beaten providing storage for the oil at convenient points. This Jly is doue by constructing cisterns in ihe orchard, or, ;r still, by providing tanks which are tilled l&gt;y lorn- bat ied by gravity. Un account of the first expense of installing facilities for handling large quantities of oil, some prefer to use coal as a fuel for orchard heating. The price of coal will vary consul erably in different communities. Where it costs U cents per bushel or $3.50 per ton, the expense; is about equal to three gallons of oil at live cents per gallon. Thus one bushel of coal will rill a burner four times and each filling will last for three hours. Three gallons of oil will rill a small burner three times and each rilling will last four hours. The objection to coal is that it is slow work rilling the beat - nitl when first lighted .some time elapses before much heat is generated. The oil burns fiercely within a minute after lighting. It is also objected that much coal is lost by being Mattered upon the ground about the heaters and in continu - ing to burn after frost danger is past, while the oil can l&gt; tiuguished at any time by merely putting the lids on the pots, thus taring the remainder of the fuel. WIir.N IX) HEAT AITI.I. OltCIIAUI Ihe discussion so far regarding the danger point of cold been for peaches only. For apples the conditions would liffercnt up to the time the buds began to swell. During dormant state in the winter time, apple buds are capable rithstanding any temperature which will not kill the I nselves. Unlike the peach, apple buds when dormant do contain all of the parts of the flower fully formed and ly to open up with the appearance &lt;&gt;f the firsi few nnrm s. When the dormant apple buds do begin to grow in the ng they first push out a tuft of leaves, which are followed </seg>
            <seg id="p275">275 by a cluster of blossoms. The apple buds are not influenced by a little warm sunshine like the buds of the peach, and con - n-nth they do not begin growing until after there has been considerable warm weather. We find the peach buds opening in central Missouri in a normal year along about the 24th of March, while the apple will be ■boot two or three weeks later. Apple buds require a bigfa temperature before they begin to grow appreciably. Peach buds, on the other hand, particularly in late spring, are apt to respond to a single day of warm sunshine by mak - ing Mime growth. Because the apple hlornioim come out one to three weeks later than peach huds open, they are much less apt to be in danger from frost. Under Missouri conditions orchard heat - ing will be needed for the peach crop far more often than the I'. There are seasons, however, as was the case in 1907, igain in 1906, when frosts and even freezes came early ay, when all the orchard fruits, including apples, were bo far advanced that they were practically all destroyed by tin- low temperature. It lie fruit grower has both peaches and apples it will he sary to provide heaters for both the orchards. While x-aches may require protection a week, two week weeks, and in some cases as much as four weeks before pples are in danger they will need to be protected again on, if the temperature is sufficiently low to endanger When the apple buds have grown sufficiently for the petals t&lt;&gt; beirin to show, they can stand a lower temperature than it is popularly supposed. At this time they could possibly with - stand from 10 to 13 degrees of freezing. From this stage on - ward their resistance to cold becomes less and less as growth progremwu.

On this account more success will attend the heat - if orchards when the air is slightly in motion than when «tly quiet. Furthermore, when the air is moving rap - conditions are unfavorable for the formation of frost. Thus it will be semi that cold, still nights are the ones the fruit grower dreads because of the danger from frost and the greater difficulty of heating the orchards. In .Missouri there are not many orchards of much consequence that are planted in low ground. However, judging from results obtained in Colorado, it would be quite possible to heat the valleys to a sufficient extent to save the (lowers or young fruit from being frozen. Bat if the area were small and consequently only a comparatively small number of beaters used, it would be quite difficult or even impossible to raise the temperature high enough. With an area of twenty to forty acres in a block in a valley, properly heated throughout, there would be very few times, if any, when the crop could not be tared. l"pon high ground, as has been seen. even thongh the surface be rough, the heat will not flow down hill. Inn escapes upward or is carried off along the ground by the wind. In .Missouri there will be few seasons, indeed, when raising the temperature as much as five degrees would not save the crop, of course the higher the ground where the orchard stands, the less the danger from frosts and the fewer the num - ber of degrees it will lie necessary to raise the temperature to save the crops. I'm- example, there have been many times in south .Missouri when, if the temperature could have been raised two degrees on the hilltops, the crops might have been •1. On the same occasions it woidd hare been necessary to raise the temperature perhaps five or six degrees on adjoin - ing land witli an elevation of one hundred feet less. By using from 7." to 100 oil pots per acre, if the orchard is fairly well derated, it should not be difficult under conditions that usually prevail in Missouri to raise the temperature ft 'i 1 1 1 1 t \\i t f it f 1 1 1 1 1* ill '* r Pi *( ■&lt; r Pl i i &lt; will "i * 1 1 1 • I** 1 1 1 v &lt;•) vc tlii* i ■ t'i 1 1 1 111 '" 1 « ' ' I » I 1 &lt; Ml I 'I'^l' . 1111."* "Ill I" ''I'll till 1 1 ' *J ». </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 I would advise that the oil pots be placed as near the trees as it is possible to get them without injury from the flames. If the trees are headed high it will be possible to place the heaters beneath the branches and in some cases even to sus - pend them from the limbs. In this way, even though the heat goes straight upward and is lost, a new supply is constantly supplied and the interior of the trees kept warm. Apple trees should not Ik' planted thicker than 70 to the at re, and on rich soil they will be still farther apart, so that if conditions will permit of beaten being placed beneath the branches, one to a tree, the number that will be necessary jkt acre can be quickly determined.

There are fifty native sorts, with hun - dreds of hybrids, many of which surpass the parents. It is hard to find a more beautiful spectucle than a great blend of color in a mass of columbines. Why don't people plant in abundance and bo match God's great out of doors? It is a shame to expect two or three little flowers to adorn the farm or home. STRICKEN WITH 8TIXGIXESS. People spend thousands on their dwellings, but when they step out of doors they are stricken with a stinginess which fairly withers them. If they have to pay more than a quarter for anything to adorn the yard they are terribly abused. A thousand-dollar picture in a ten-cent frame seems to be their Oriental poppies are like flames flashing In the sunlight. A bed of them like a miniature sea of fire.

LINCOLN The growing of horticultural crops in eastern Nebraska has been, up to the present time, largel] of secondary impor - tance among farm operations. The climate and soil are raited to the growing of a wide range of crops, including those of a horticultural nature, hut owing to the large acreage of each farm the desire for quick cash returns from the crops and the favorable conditions for stock growing, not a great deal of commercial growing of things horticultural has ben attempted. Then there are comparatively few men in eastern Nebraska who are experienced in the growing of horticultural crops The majority of those following agriculture in this section have either been reared here on our farms or have moved from states to the east of us where general farming is practiced largely, and consequently they are not trained horticultni .Many of these farmers, although primarily grain and stock growers, wish to maintain a small home orchard as an adjunct to their main lines of work for the purpose of having a home supply of good fruit, and to protect and beautify their farm home by growing windbreak*, shade trees, and ornamentals. There is a proper place for math planting as well as for the strictly commercial aspects of horticulture, and the enconr - ageraent and development of this phase of horticulture, is one of the most important problems to lie solved in connection with development of the horticultural resources of this section. </seg>

' &lt; oininercial fruit growing is also heing looked upon with moie favor in this section. Prom fifteen fo twenty years ago many orchards of from five to twenty acres in extent, and a few covering as many as forty and eighty acres, were planted. The majority of the owners expected larpre yields of good fruit with little or no attention and expense in connection. They wit-e disappointed.

Of the fruits grown in eastern Nebraska the apple is by far of the most importance both for the home and commercially. The upland Boil of practically all of this section is well suited to the apple and some of the very choicest varieties to be found anywhere in the Union, such a« the Jonathan and Grimes' Golden, which have a national reputation for their quality, are well adapted to a large part of this territory. Reports received by the writer from orchardists in Saline, Washington, Nemaha, and Otoe counties make mention of the fact that single trees of Jonathan the past season (19091 yielded from twenty to thirty bushels of hand-picked apples. One man reports Grimes' Golden yielding more than thirty </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 huslit'ls per tree and several speak of yields of from twenty to twenty-five bushel*) per tree. A Nciualia county apple grower tells of one and one-half ■t-rvri of .lonatlians returning bun f331.55 per acre and a frac - 1 ion of an acre of Grimes' Golden yielded at the rate of $1,000 per acre. He t&gt;oes on to say thai his Gauo returned $958 from three and three-fourths acres and his Winesap •¥•"&gt;(»() from four and one-half acres. I Washington county grower reports £5,000 from a fifty - oivhard, only a part of which bore well this season. A y county orchardist reports $2,500 received from a ty-five-acre orchard and the purchasers picked the fruit, [•chard of twenty-two acres in Antelope county four miles the edge of the great sand hill district returned to the rs $2,000 last season. I' cherry, while it is not grown commercially to any great t, is to he found on almost every farm in eastern Ne - a. The sour cherries are grown almost exclusively and varieties as Early Richmond and Montmorency do ex - mally well when given attention. Many trees of later ies have died out during the last eight or ten years as a : of a fungous disease of the leaves, but the varieties men - 1 have been affected but slightly. ties can be grown very successfully in practically all eastern part of the state.

The strawberry is grown commercially to tome extent over the whole of eastern Nebraska, but in the vicinities of Omaha, Fort Calhouu, and Blair it is grown quite extensively. A number of instances may be cited where returns of from | to $800 per acre have been received in one season. A Blair grower reports the sale of one day's picking from four acre for $."&gt;(&gt; 1 last season. E linns, peaches, raspberries, blackberries, and other fruits doing well where properly cared for and are important icultural crops in this section. The returns mentioned above are not an average by any means for this section. Many home orchards as well as or - chards of larger proportions have never given profitable re - turns, but on the other hand the owners of these unprofitable fruit plantations in most cases are to blame. They do not know the business or are negligent. Nature, with the proper nsslstance of the owners, will produce returns equally as good in almost all parts of eastern Nebraska, and if she is assisted in growing these things, as the orchardist of the much adver - tised fruit sections of the West assists her, she will even do better by them. Although most of the plantations from which the indicated returns were received have had far better care than the average in this section, the care given them is very limited compared with that given commercial orchards in the West. The writer is of the opinion that if the truth was known, with the same amount of intelligence, labor, and expense ap - plied to the orchards and fruit business in this section, that returns would compare quite favorably with those of some of the far-famed fruit districts of the Pacific coast. The attain - ment of the very best results, however, requires special horti - cultural knowledge and even to succeed fairly well in this section the grower must keep himself well informed on new horticultural ideas and put Into practice those that will be of advantage to him. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">The people of this section are bfroniag more and more in - terested each year in the horticultural setting of their home*. More shade and ornamental trees are being planted as well ihrubbery and flowers. It was hut a few years ago that the nurserymen of the state sold hardly enough ornamental - and plants to pay them to carry these things in stock. I tut the demand for ornamentals has grown steadily until mm this part of the nursery business is one of the most im - portant. The effect of this ornamental planting is making a wonderful change in the appearance of the farm homes of eastern Nebraska. They are transformed from bleak, lonely barren places of existence to pleasant and attractive places to live. Let the good work go on. </seg>
