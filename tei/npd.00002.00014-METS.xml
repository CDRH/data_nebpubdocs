INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT.

•Six boys are able to work from drawings and do their work" 
well. Nearly all are able to do the common repair work about 
the buildings. We have turned out some specimens of cabinet 
work which would, do credit to any shop for handwork. We

¦course of study is modeled after the general plan of mechanical 
training schools.

APPROPRIATIONS. 

The appropriations made by the last legislature will be 

¦ient to support the school to the end of the biennial period. 
fund provided for fire-escape has been expended in 
ng four fire-escapes with platform landings at each 

ry, one at north side of north wing, one at south side of 

th wing, one at each side of cottage building, thus providing 

ilities for escape in case of fire. A new high-speed auto- 

mata engine has been placed in position. We find it satis- 

ictorj and an improvement for our purposes over the one 

ire had in before The appropriation for inside blinds has 

¦expended for that purpose, and the buildings are supwith 
neat double shutters, greatly adding to their comfort 

nd appearance. The buildings are being united by telephonic 

Direction, which when completed will be an improvement 

,venience to the administrative department, facilitating 

tlie transaction of its business. The appropriation for the im- 

vements on grounds was expended in placing slagolithic 

pavements in rear of buildings, connecting all and making a 

j\ed driveway between industrial building and dining-room.

RECOMMENDATIONS. 

be legal Dame for this school is The Nebraska Institution 
e Deaf and Dumb. The advanced thought in regard to 

of our people is that the word " dumb " should not 

.i 

1 to them, conveying as it does to most minds the 
cntal weakness. Parents have a delicacy in placing 
irtunate deaf children in what might in any way be 
i an asylum. Therefore I recommend that the name 

id of this objectional feature and that this institution 
as the Nebraska School for the Deaf. Also that the 

\v 

:\ 

tie of the head be changed from Principal and 

a 

1 1 Superintendent. In order to widen the scope of 

ward 

hi- industrial department and provide facilities for the inreased 
number which will be in attendance in the near future, 

i suggest that steps be taken to provide additional trades 
among which would be shoemaking. We would not require 
any additional room, but will need to have a room finished and 
funds are asked for that purpose. The heating apparatus in th e 
old buildings need overhauling and parts renewed. A vegetable 
cellar is required and should be outside of the buildings. 
Our laundry machines are worn out and should be replaced 
with new ones. In order that we may have fire protection </seg>

            <seg id="p014">
and an available supply of water at all times, I suggest that 
ou* plant be connected with the city system. This can !&gt;•' 
done at small cost, as the city company will lay mains to their 
reservoir in the near future, in which case the line will be near 
to us. To accomplish these objects estimates have been mad.-and 
are herewith submitted.

CONCLUSION. 

In concluding this report, allow me i&lt;&lt; thank 

continued confidence and for the many acts of kindm ¦- 
ceived at your hands. And to the gentlemen of the board I 
desire to extend thanks for their consideration and for .their 
readiness to extend advice and assistance and for their many 
courtesies, and to my assistants whose loyal support lias 
tributed so greatly to the successful management of the 
institute. Hoping that the school may continue to merit 
the confidence and sympathy of the state which has characterized 
it in the past, and with gratitude unto Him who 
doeth all things well, this report is submitted.
