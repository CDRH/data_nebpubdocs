            <seg id="p010">11 PBOTEE1&gt;; The Secretary and Treasurer submitted the following rep which were referred to the Auditing Committee: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Lincoln, Xehraska. Jan. 13, 1903. Officers and Members of the \ehrimku State Hurtirnltural Society: We again come together in our annual meeting, and I wish to congratulate the society on the splendid fruit show made at the last annual state fair. The grounds about the Horticultural Mall have Iwn put in good condition by our friend and co-worker. Mr. J. H. FTadkinson. which eventually will add much to our exhibit and provide :i comfortable resting place for our friends. The interior of the hall has been improved by the addition of a tloral case, when- cut flowers may be kept in good condition for the week, where origi - nally, they were badly spoiled in a day. Some jiermanent tables have been provided and as fast as the funds of the society will admit, others should be put in and painted. The outside derma tions should be completed this season by providing a waste for the little lake, and cementing the l&gt;ottom of it so as to make a suitable place to contain fish. The sale of any fruit, flowers or other exhibits by the exhibitors is expressly forbidden by the rules of the State Hoard, but the officers should see to it that the rules are enforced, as much arose from this source at the last state fair. The experimental stations, already established, should l»e con 'inued and I would recommend one or more in the extreme south - west portion of our state. The St. Louis Exposition should have the immediate attention of the society, and arrangements made for putting fruit in cold storage this fall to be ready at the installation &lt;&gt;f the exposition. Much inconvenience has l&gt;een caused on account of the slowness of the printing of our reports. The past season the contract not let until late in the season, and as the Secretary is not known in the matter, he cannot hurry it up. The report is now ready and </seg>

Sterling Morton as one of our most precious legacies, and rejoice that one of our own number, by a forceful and honorable life, has lifted our calling to a higher plane of excellence. Mr. Morton's life was both a text and sermon on the possibilities of home adornment. We feel most keenly the loss of Henry A. Longsdorf. He was of such a genial and kindly nature that each one of us has a sense of personal loss. He was an enthusiast in our work, a faithful atendant of our meetings, a gentleman of refinement, a lover of home and one of our early pioneers who helped to mould our state. Mr. Elias Beaver was also one of our pioneers, and manifi - deep interest in the work of the society. By his exhibits in the early days, and his {persistence and encouragement in fruit grow - ing, he was one of the factors of our success, helping to place us in the front ranks as a successful fruit growing state. Mr. H. H. Blodgett had been a member of our society for many years, was always interested in its success and in the reputation of our state. He was closely identified with us for many years. Thus death has been busy in our ranks and slowly the older members are passing away, leaving their memories and their histories behind as the sacred assets of our society. God grant, as we pass along, it may be to the sweet fields be - yond the swelling Hood and never withering flowers, where the tree of life will extend to us its luscious fruits. A. J. Brown. L. A.

He was educated in the district schools and in Dickinson College, was taught to be a farmer, and later learned the hardware business, and at various times taught school. He enlisted in the army during the War of the Rebellion and became captain of Company A of the 158th Penn - sylvania Infantry. In 1869 he married Miss Kate A. Duey, and to them six children were born, four now surviving. He led an active and useful life, and was respected and loved for his strong upright and kindly character. The interest which he took in fruits and fruit-culture during fty years of his life deserves a special mention. Early in life le found employment with David Miller, proprietor of the Cum - berland Nurseries, and later was associated with his brothers n the Valley Nurseries and with H. S. Kupp, another widely nown nurseryman and florist. These were all within a few liles of each other in the splendid Cumberland Valley, the birth - &gt;lace of numerous varieties of fruits, several of them bearing the ame "Cumberland." From actual nursery work he went to the selling of trees and traveled extensively, especially through his wn state and the South. Apart from this and from his nursery work he had opportunities for testing and observing varieties in rchards which he helped to plant and rear on his father's farms, nd for many years he was a member of the committee on nomen - ature of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. Mr. Longsdorf had such a knowledge of all indigenous fruits 8 was notable, but he knew the apple most intimately. For many years he was a dealer in that fruit which he packed in the rchard under his own supervision. He thus had occasion to isit many different apple-growing districts, and to note the ariations produced by soil and climatic conditions and to learn nd classify different local names for the same variety. A valu - ble essay on the results of these observations was his con - ribution to a volume of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's eports. Several other essays on the marketing of fruits and on arieties have been prepared by him. While engaged in selling </seg>
            <seg id="p024">I'KorEEItl 25 apples he undertook what was then a hazardous simulation, th&lt; shipping of apples from southwestern Missouri over 1.600 miles to eastern Pennsylvania. Probably this was one of the firs introductions of the East to the splendid fruits of the Missour valley. It may be added that while the trade would not buj Romanites, which in the East grow small and mean, they had no prejudice against the same apple from Missouri under the name "Gilpin" and bought them readily at high prices. Mr. Longsdorf enjoyed the acquaintance and personal friend ship of many of the great horticulturists of his generation. He was a correspondent of Mr. Charles Downing, and once had the honor of setting right the error of Mr. Downing, who gracefully acknowledged the fact. In his home at Bellevue, surrounded by a couple of acres of garden land, he found rather late in life an admirable chance to experiment. He deemed himself too old at that time to begin commercial orcharding, but conducted with interest his small garden of fruits and attended regularly the meetings of the braska Horticultural Society of which he was a member. About 1892 he began the culture of peaches by way of experiment. One previous attempt had been made with some success by his neigh - bor, Mr. B. R. Stouffer, who had a row of peach trees growing like a hedge. They were the offspring of seeds brought from Richardson county, of a peach which proved to be Wright's B ling. Mr. Russell had already gone extensively into peach cul - ture near Wyrnore. but Mr. Longsdorfs was the first systematic trial in his section of Nebraska which was successful. He be - lieved he could take a variety which would reproduce itself and by growing trees from the seeds of native fruits and so on for several generations of trees acclimate the peach and inure it to low temperatures. Another feature of the experiment was to plant the trees in a hedge or copse so they would mutually protect each other, but this afterward proved unnecessary. In 1895 the first blossoms appeared and set a score or mor peaches on about seventy trees which covered not over twenty by eighty feet of ground. About two bushels was the crop in </seg>
            <seg id="p025">26 NEBRASKA STATE HORTH'CI.Tl RAL SOCIBTT. and alK&gt;ut twelve bushels in 1897. By this time two new generations of trees were growing and some budded varieties also were planted. Of these the Bokhara was a notable failure while Champion and Triumph were successful. The winter o 1897-1898. being very cold, killed the buds and only a few dozen peaches were borne. During one winter where great coW followed a long period of dry weather with no snowfall, th ground having become cracked by drouth froze deeply and winte killing destroyed a good many trees. But for the fact that th exact conditions were not likely to be frequent this would hav just alKHit spelled "failure." It thinned out the trees and th increased yield thereafter demonstrated the fallacy of the close planting theory which was already partly abandoned. Heavy an frequent crops have followed in later years and no year has see every bud destroyed. There have always been at least a dozen o more peaches in the worst years, and at least two out of three years have shown full crops. Wright's Seedling has been mos successful and Russell and Champion next in order. Mr. Longs dorf propagated young peach trees, a few of which he sold. an&lt; many of which he gave away to neighbors who would take thei and agree to care for the trees. He cheerfully gave advice or instructions to any one who wished to plant, and at this tini there are probably 5.000 peach trees in Sarpy county of beariu age, which are largely the result of his work. He tested many new varieties of Riiiall fruits, and his experi ence and judgment were given much weight among his fellows. The last new fruit which he thus tried, and which he highly recommended, was the Cumberland raspberry originated by his old associate David Miller. His interest in all sorts of trees was life long. In one of his first letters from Nebraska territory in 1856 he speaks of apple and peach growing. When his home was made just west of Bellevue at the old "Plateau House" in that year, trees were planted, and one, a cottonwood, still stands alone. It is over four feet in diameter and is said to be the largest planted tree in Nebraska. Work among his trees was his constant pleasure. </seg>

Mr. Jackson — I can only tell you something of what we are doing. We have our society meetings at our capitol, and we have members from a great many states. We have organized on a basis where we think we can learn something. Our society has divided our state into districts. The northern part of the state has got to </seg>
            <seg id="p028">29 handle different fruits from what we handle in the southern part. In the southern district, our apples are entirely different from what we raise in the northern part. We have stations that ex - periment along this line, and they are doing good work. We are working along the line of seedlings, and we think we haw some that are going to prove equal, if not better, than anything we have at present. I have attended this society three or four different times from our state, and I have been a member of our society for a number of years, and I do not remember of ever seeing a delegate from this society. I think we ought to work together. It would be better for us to work in harmony. We would be glad to see some members from this society at our meetings. We would be glad to see more interest taken in sending delegates to our meetings. We have delegates from several states every year, and I believe it would be worth while for delegates to attend our meetings. I would be glad to see them. C. S. Harbison — I move that these delegates be made honorary members of our society for the coming year. Motion carried. Mr. Jackson — I thank you and the society for the honor. Mr. Edwards — I am very much pleased to be here with 1 thank the society for the vote just cast. Mr. Jackson has ex - pressed my sentiments in full. This year I was urged by the members of the society to come, and I made an effort to do so. I am glad I came. There is a plate of Jonathan apples that I present to the presi - dent. Apples that I took out of the bin just before leaving hi and they are the average size. They claim I am a Jonathan crank. It does me good, for while I cannot eat strawberries from Florida in January, I can eat the best apple that grows on earth, and I can grow it in southwestern Iowa. That is worth a good deal to me. We have the largest fruit plant of any district in the state, and we have a very good society. Sometimes we lag in business, but our society has about the best men in south - western Iowa in it. I am proud of our calling along the line of horticulture. I will not take much of vour time. I onlv want </seg>

We want to see a lot of you over there. Bring your wives and have a good time. We want you to come. Our next annual meeting will be at Glenwood. Last fall, 145 car-loads of apples went out of there, KM) car-loads were hauled away in wagons and from fifty to seventy-five car-loads perished on the trees, because Omaha did not send pickers over there. I want to say a word for the Ben Davis. It is a reliable variety to grow, sure to give returns and always easily marketed. The Ben Davis and the Jonathan are the money-makers. The President — I am sure we are very thankful for the invita- tion they have given us to attend their summer meeting. Mr. Swan — I am in favor of the whole society going. Mr. Edwards — I am interested in this part of it, and if left this way, I am afraid we will not see any of you over there. ( i. A. Marshall— We must send five and see that they go.

The I'ni versity is glad and proud to have you come here and congregate on these grounds. We are interested in your lines of work, and hope that the University may be able to help advance the same. I believe that a liberal education ought to have the effect of furthering the interests of the people. No language is too strong to describe the importance of the work which has to be don the development of the state, in making the life of farmers and their families more healthful and attractive. The farmer of to - day is in advance of the farmer of long ago, and the progress he is making will continue. The farmer of the future will be far in advance of those now on the stage in those things which make farming profitable and the farmer's lot desirable. Education is the main force producing the change — not only the education offered in colleges and universities, but this, along with that «e - cured through reading the discussions and papers at farn institutes, and reflection. Meetings like the present one are in - valuable. I am never present to hear papers read as are now to be presented without reflecting how great our privileges are to-day in comparison with those enjoyed by the farmers of a half-generation ago.

This coining together from year to year, and xchanging of ideas from the discussion of papers read here, is ' great value in an educational way. Our professors tell us of le scientific way of dealing with different subjects, while the irmers and horticulturists give their practical way of dealing ith these subjects, and by combining the two methods, we are continually advancing in horticulture. KANSAS STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. tIJ.v request of some of the members, William H. Barnes, secre - ry of the Kansas State Horticultural Society, spoke as follows regard to their society : Several of your people have come to me at the hotel asking as ) how our society is supported. Our society was organized in 876. In a very short time the legislature began to assist us, nd have assisted us for a number of years, giving a certain mount of money for general expenses, etc. We usually wanted more each year than we got the year previous. The appropria - odh are as follows: Secretary, $1,200; stenographer and clerk. 600; postage, $500; annual meeting expenses, $200; secretary's raveling expenses, $200; then $100 is appropriated for books; 100 for incidentals in the office. This is the extent of our ap - ropriations, not including printing and office supplies. Wo lave issued in the last three years several special works, one each n the apple, the peach, the plum, the grape, and the cherry, 'hat is one way our society sends out information.

            <seg id="p032">33 hers. They meet once a month in their counties. We hold our state meetings in the state house. The Kansas Horticultural So - ciety has as fine quarters as any state in the Union, except Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, which are kept up by the state. We have jars of preserved fruits, casks of Kansas apples, medals, and a fine library. As mentioned, the state gives us f 100 for books. Our walls are lined with portraits of our officers and leading horticulturists. Twenty-eight or thirty of the best horti - cultural papers of the country come to us as exchanges. The only one we pay for is Country Life in America. We constantly extend and try to make our work better and better. An invita - tion is extended to all who are interested to visit our rooms and t(i meet with us at our annuals. REPORT OF C. B. HARRISON, DELEGATE TO THE KAN 8AS STATE HORTICULTURAL MEETING. The Kansas State Horticultural Society gathering was wedged in between the holidays, meeting December 29, 30 and 31. Fred Wellhouse, "the apple king of the world," was in the chair and W. H. Barnes, a successful fruit-grower, was secretary. The old officers were re-elected, with the exception of Major Holsinger, who preferred to have his son. an extensive small fruit grower, take his place. Monday afternoon instructive reports were presented from the seven fruit districts of the state. The apple crop was enormous, but was keeping badly on account of the warm weather of Oc - tober and November. The apple that received the highest com - mendation on account of its excellence and hearing qualities was the York Imperial, but its keeping qualities were poor and it was not a success in cold storage. While a late keeper east, it is a fall apple in Kansas and the general want is for a long - keeping apple. Of course, there was a heavy battle pro and con over the Ben Davis and at times the contest grew interesting. The Janette got a black eye and had but few champions, so one of the best apples in Nebraska has not much favor in Kansas. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">34 from one tree. A. H. QriNB, of Lawrence, sold $700 worth of Keifers from a few trees. Other kinds were hardly spoken of, these taking the lead. It was the general opinion that plums do not do nearly as well in the eastern part of the state, where there is plenty of rain, as in the western and dryer portions of the state. There the Ameri - can, European and Japanese sorts did fairly well. There was iiot much discussion on the respective merits of any variety. Cherries seemed to be a success both east and west. They have about the same kind that succeed in Nebraska. I made diligent inquiry regarding that new candidate for popular favor, the Baldwin, but did not find anyone who had fruited it successfully. It did not seem to l&gt;e as early a bearer as the Richmond, and those who had planted it were deferring judgment regarding its merits. nsiderable attention was given to strawberries, as in the cast this fruit is a great money maker. The praise and severe condemnation conferred on the Excelsior and some other sorts by men living but a few miles apart was almost laughable. There is one feature of the Kansas society — there is more give-and-take and sharp thrusts given in good-nature than in any other society I ever attended. There was much said on fertile and infertile sorts, and Major Holsinger insisted that the whole thing was bosh, that all kinds, if well treated, were fertilizers. Of course this was resented and led to warm discussion. Parker Earle rather led as a favorite, while Clyde. Excelsior, Monitor and others had warm advocates. There was much discussion on the merits and demerits of irrigation, and this is not much practiced in the eastern part of the state. Raspberries hold an important position. On the way to To - peka I stopped over to see Mr. (Jriesa, of Lawrence, who originated the Cardinal raspberry. It is an immense grower, and the gen - eral testimony was that it was an enormous bearer, transcending every other, but it was a poor seller on account of its color. This might be an objection in a great fruit center like Kansas City. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OK H. A. EMERSON, DELE&lt; . 35 but in Nebraska, when- raspberries ai e, it would not weigh a moment. In our state good fruit, if home grown, is gobbled up in a moment, and it is so prolific and hardy that I believe it will be just the thing we are looking for. The Cum - berland was the favorite among the black raspberries — a fine berry, large and prolific and good to market. I should have said that the Cardinal was a cross between the red and black, much like the oldShafer. only more robust, and I found the originator sending out walking-sticks to the agents cut from the canes. We were glad to note that there were some ardent fruit-grow - ers among the women. Mrs. C. \V. Kullard, of Leavenworth county, read a paper on "Home Adornment." I did not hear it, but know it must have been first-class. This gifted woman was "to the manner born." She is the daughter of Mr. Wellhouae, and with her able helpmate is at work raising apples on a large scale. She is an enthusiast i&lt;- teacher of the "evangel of beauty," and a band of influential women like herself will make an im - pression on the state. The writer was called on for an address, and, of course, launched out on the theme of working the gold mine in the front yard and making the farmhouse the most lioautiful spot on earth. Kansas — like Nebraska — is now in po - sition for a forward march along the line of beautifying home and laying out parks. Topeka is soon to have a fine park system, and a talk with one of the park commissioners showed that they were up-to-date, but it was hard to get the city fathers into the procession. On the whole the meeting was a very hopeful cast, and every one was looking over the borders of the new year with sanguine expectancy. REPORT OF R. A. EMERSON, DELEGATE TO MINNESOTA HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The thirty-sixth annual meeting of the Minnesota State Horti - cultural Society was held in Minneapolis, December 2 to "&gt;, 1902. The society is made up of a most energetic and enthusiastic lot </seg>
            <seg id="p035">36 XEBl: VTE HORTK TI.TLRAI. SOCIETY. of men. Almost every member seemed imbued with the idea that Minnesota is bound to become an important fruit state. All of them apparently recognize the great difficulties under which they work, but are determined to establish pomology in Minnesota at any cost. In making this report, the writer has not attempted to give a summary of all the papers presented at the meeting, nor even to mention all of them. In selecting, he may have omitted some of the best articles. The only object of presenting a report of the doings of a horticultural society of a neighboring state is that Nebraska horticulturists may profit by what fruit men in other states have learned. The writer will therefore mention only those features of the meeting which seem to him of greatest im - portance to Nebraskans. The two great difficulties with which Minnesota fruit-growers have to contend are drought and cold. These are the most serious drawbacks to Nebraska horticulture as well. If Minnesota beats Nebraska on rainfall, the difference is made up by the severity o her winters. Nearly every speaker at the meeting called at tention to the necessity of protecting fruit plants and trees from the cold winters and the growing of only such fruits as are especially adapted to withstand extreme cold. Mr. D. V. Plants, of Long Lake, told of a method of protecting raspberries and blackberries from winter injury which may prove of use in northern Nebraska. Various methods of laying down and covering raspberries for winter protection have been tried be fore, but all of them necessitate much hand work. By the method in use at Long Lake, all the work is done by horsepower. Mr. Plants' device consists of a drag shaped like a funnel cut in two lengthwise, and two plows, one right-handed and the other left - handed, which are attached to the right and left sides of the drag so as to throw the dirt toward it. Four horses are used to draw the machine. The drag with the large end ahead gradually bends the bushes down and draws them together as the machine is drawn along the row, and the plows cover the canes with earth before the drag releases them. Mr. Plants said that the machine </seg>
            <seg id="p036">37 covers all the eUMi tfcottmgUj and don not break tlu'in badly as they are usually broken in hand covering. Prof. William Robertson, of St. Anthony Park, advocated mulching strawberries to the depth of a foot after the ground had frozen hard. The next spring when the plants show signs of growth, he would rake the straw to the middle of the rows, leaving it just deep enough over the plants so that they could come up through it. Other members also favored this deep mulching of strawberries, but some berry growers preferred much thinner mulches, believing that the deep mulch would smother the plants. Professor Robertson, however, called at - tention to the fact that he never mulched his plants until the ground was deeply frozen and that the heavy mulch keeps the ground frozen so late in the spring that the plants do not blossom until danger of frosts is past. He held that the plants would not be smothered while the ground was frozen and that the ground would remain frozen under the deep mulch until about time to uncover them in spring. As a means of protecting grapes against root killing, Secretary Latham recommended plowing the ground four to six inches deep in the fall, turning the furrows toward the rows. He also suggested cutting off all side roots to the depth of four inches every two years to induce deeper rooting. Many members of the society advocated very deep planting as a preventive of root killing. Depths all the way from six to twenty inches below where the tree stood in the nursery were suggested. Absurd as this may seem to most Nebraska planters, these extreme depths were strongly advocated by some of the speakers at the Minnesota meeting. In fact, most of the men who discussed the topic insisted that deep planting was one of the best ways of protecting tree roots from both winter cold and summer drought. It was pointed out, however, that this practice could not be followed on low, wet soils. The need of winter protection came out in almost every paper. In the discussion of suitable slopes for orchards, northern ex - posures were advised by some, but others were strongly in f </seg>
            <seg id="p037">38 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. of south slopes or level land, advising against northern slopes unless adequate protection could be had from north winds through the use of windbreaks. The value of straw mulches was pointed out. not only as a means of protection against root killing, but also to hold moisture in dry seasons. A. D. I^each. of Excelsior, in a paper on the care of tree trunks, illustrated in a very happy way how tree trunks may be pro - tected from sunscald and like injuries. He believed the best way to protect tree trunks was to have no trunks to protect. He would allow the limbs of the trees to form practically at the sur - of the ground. That cold winters are not the only things to be guarded against was frequently urged. &lt;!. EL Whiting, of Yankton. S. I)., in - sisted that shelter belts to the south and west of orchards and gardens to protect them against the drying winds of summer were even more beneficial than protection on the north. Secretary I^atham expressed his l&gt;elief that the most important lesson to be learned by Minnesota fruit growers is to cultivate carefully to maintain moisture sufficient for the needs of the trees. He de - clared that the fruit for exhibition in off years almost invariably conies from cultivated orchards and gardens. Professor Green of the agricultural school rejK&gt;rted that absolute failure had re - sulted from efforts to establish an orchard on the high tableland of one of the experiment stations in the western part of the state where no protection was provided against the dry south winds. With such protection as wind-breaks afford, however, very good results were secured in growing apples and other fruits. If these things are true of Minnesota, are they not even more true of some parts of our own state? Not only are Minnesota horticulturists doing much to overcome the difficulties in the way of successful fruit growing by adopting improved methods of culture, but they are also attacking the problem earnestly from the other standpoint, that of breeding fruits better adapted to their climate. The spur of necessity impels the horticulturists of Minnesota, just as it does those of </seg>
            <seg id="p038">39 many other states, to produce fruits that can survive in the 1 ous climate**. But this is not all. The fact that the Wealthy apple, which has done so much toward extending successful apple growing far into the northw - originated in Min - nesota, seems to have kindled a local enthusiasm in the duction of new fruits such as is seldom known in other states. That MinnesotanH take a just pride in the origin of the Wealthy apple is indicated by the fact that money is being raised by the Horticultural Society for a memorial to Peter (lideon. the origi - nator of the Wealthy.

Your delegate was astonished to find that out of perhaps some fifty members present at one of the sessions, twenty-three are eugaged in growing seedlings with the definite aim of securing a hardy late-keeping winter apple. Whether or not the society is ever called ujK)n to pay the thousand-dollar prize, the present active interest ill the su of fruit breeding must certainly result in the production of greatly improved varieties of fruits for the northwt Besides the prize of fl.(MM), the society provides liberal niiuuis for new seedlings at exhibitions, just as for the stan varieties of fruits. Of the very large number of seedlings shown at the winter meetings, two were thought by the committee to be worthy of trial. One was a crab-apple originated by I&gt;. •'. 11 ton, which the committee pronounced better than any grown in Minnesota. The second was a large, very dark, stri|&gt;ed re&lt;l yellow apple, known as Yahnke's King, produced by Frank Yahnke, of Winona, Minn. This apple was said to be pro - ductive, perfectly hardy, and a giwxl keeper. </seg>

IPhe fruit furnished by the society is very little of it bearing, was left with the stations to select their own stuff. We have i Pearl, Josselyn, Downing, Champion and Houghton goose - rries. The Champion, in character, is between the Downing d Houghton. I will gay in regard to these that none of them e better than the Downing. The Champion is a little different d well worth cultivating. You can pull these berries off by nning your hands along the under side of the bush. The Jos - lyn is not as good a berry with us as the Downing. The Pearl practically the same as the Downing, at least that has been our perience. I The station has a new raspberry that has originated there with i, and we consider it hardier than the Gregg. C. S. Harrison — Is it a blackcap? Mr. Marshall — Yes, sir, it is. There is a new plum that has originated above there that is ready to be sent out by the station. It is claimed to be a Jap - anese plum, but probably of an American type. It is a very desirable plum. It is larger than the Miner. We find that the Early Morello cherry and the Weir's North - west are the same. The Weir's Northwest was claimed to be the earliest cherry, and at one time was known in this state as the Dave Reed cherry. We had some thirty or forty trees of each kind, and they are identical. We got to calling it Early Morello after that. We have been experimenting with different kinds of fertilizers, using some of the blood fertilizer and raw bone meal. We used them in the vineyard, cherry orchard, apple orchard and nursery. Watching it for some time, we did not think it paid. We hauled some manure from sheep-yards at a cost of 65 cents per load, and we think that we were paid over 100 per cent, more than we were from the commercial fertilizers. </seg>
            <seg id="p040">REPORT OF ARLINGTON EXPERIMENT STATION. 41 Qumction — How much of the fertilizer did you use to the tm-? Mr. Marshall — We did not go by the tree. We used the common barnyard manure and got it much cheaper and quicker than we did the commercial fertilizer, and it gave better results. The results of the bone dust were not al - together satisfactory. We experimented on five acres with sheep manure at about two-thirds of the cost of the commercial fer - tilizer. This was in nursery stock and, after the land was cleared of the trees last spring, we planted it to corn and shucked ninety bushels per acre from it. Mr. Youngers — What difference do you find between the Pearl and Downing gooseberry? Mr. Marshall — We find very little difference in them. There is not enough to make any distinction. Question — Did you notice any difference in the crop produc - tion where you used the artificial fertilizer and the barnyard fertilizers ? Mr. Marshall — As I said before, taking in account the differ - ence in cost of the two, we got better results from the common barnyard manure. Mr. Hess (florist) — We have used the commercial fertilizers, also the sheep and cowyard manure, and find for our purposes that the common sheep and cowyard manure give better results. To get the best results from the commercial fertilizers they should be applied in the liquid form, and with great care. It takes an experienced man to use these successfully. Mr. Beltzer — I want to say a word on gooseberries. Five years ago I got the Pearl as an experiment. I also have the Downing. I cannot see a great deal of difference between the two. The best gooseberries in our country are the Downing and Houghton. J. P. Jackson (Iowa) — I have been doing a little experiment - ing with the Pearl and Downing, and find that they are about the same. The Downing appeared to me to be the better. I can - not see much, if any, difference, but the Downing satisfies me well enough. </seg>

Our station is situated on a level plane with sandy soil and pure sand from the soil to the water which is from four to eight feet beneath the surface on ordinary seasons. The past summer has been exceedingly wet, from early spring until late fall, and on the 14th of June there came a hail-storm that destroyed my corn and garden crops and greatly injured not only my fruit trees but all forest trees also. There has been no season in seventeen years residence here that has been so un - favorable as the past. I send you specimens showing the effect of the hail on apples, cottonwood, and diamond willow.

The year 1902 has been a hard one here; hail on the 2. r &gt;th of June barked all the trees on the south side, killed most young planted trees and damaged the older ones considerably. The trees were loaded with fruit and promised a splendid crop. At least 300 bushels of plums, half-grown, were destroyed. l&gt;eside all the small fruit. QMMMbcrrim were about gone, and June berries were partly ripe. I received this year sixty-two trees from the society through Marshall Brothers, and they were planted O. K. and have been, of course, hailed also, but most of them will recover. They were two-year trees, and I had to cut them back to six inches anyhow, as trees positively refuse to grow here on two-year nursery heads. headed, say. three feet high. The only trees that can l&gt;e made to grow here on open land are one year cut back to six to eight inches. Older trees are a waste of time and money in northwest Nebraska. Have tried thousands and advise others not to try it any more, but plant one year trees cut back. Fruit can be grown here in plenty, but only with trees branched right above the ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p044">45 Lucretia dewberries do fine here with a little cover. Flor&gt; crab-apple is a grand success, also Dyehouse and Ostheim cherry. The best plums here are the Sandoz. Wyant and Hawkeye, also the De Soto, but this latter is a slow grower and early to decay. Wolf, Rollingstone. Stoddard and Klondike do fairly well. All the above bear heavily on upland without irrigation. Juneberries are the berry for the northwest. No farmer ought to fail to plant a patch. I have just distributed, free, wagon-loads of plants from my early plantings, which were among my plums and in the way. Plant all trees with the graft about six inches below ground, and no plums on other than American roots ought to be planted. I hope to have a better year, this 1903, but must largely repair the damage done through the hail of last year. Am putting out about 300 new trees, also lots of shrubbery. I hope to get quainted personally with the society at the coming winter meeting. REPORT OF VALENTINE EXPERIMENT STATION. BY C. M. VAN METER. The stock furnished this year was planted and all that wu thoroughly cultivated grew aieriy, M it always does with me. but the apple trees, eight in number, were given such care only as two or three year orchard trees, with the result that three are dead. The first year is the critical period. There are present sev - eral kinds of insects. Am not able to identify them. There is fruit disease of cherry and apple and leaf disease of apple, cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. Would like information on these things. There has also been frost every month in the year and severe hail and rain storm the 15th of August, ruining some things. But with all this the planting here, as a whole, is in a thrifty condition and I hope some good will result. Crab-apples, cherries, plums, and gooseberries and strawber - ries will succeed.

Planting for foliage effect in autumn, we are tame as compared with the east. I think we can plant so that our landscaj&gt;es will be as a great garden of flowers in the fall. The wild cherry surpasses the elm. box elder and maple in the rapidity of its growth, and gives us one of the richest of all the foliage trees. A year ago my attention was called to this feature while in Minnesota, and I noticed after frost that my young trees put on robes of exquisite beauty varying in i from deepest crimson to purest gold. The black haw of the IMatte river is one of the viburnum family and that has most exquisite coloring. The oaks have been too much neglected. We have ten kinds growing in Nebraska and the foliage effect is fine. There are large groves with some good sized trees growing west of the HMIth meridian. There is an oak in York, the acorn from which it sprang fell out of a nursery box twenty-five years ago. It is about fourteen inches through and thirty-five feet high. Some pin oaks from Thos. Meehan's E show the very richest foliage eftV The Kims. — We have about eighteen kinds of these, and the diversity of foliage is fine. There are two kinds of weepers, two </seg>

Some Smt&lt;h elms planted in York twenty-five years ago are now of great size, and very fine and shapely. Strange to say they sprout from the root like the black locust. This can be obviated by grafting or budding on our native stock. Erhe Thurlow willow surpasses anything else in rapidity of &gt;wth. This has a straight stem and weeps from the limbs much the form of the cut-leaved birch. The Regalis willow is very iutiful, having leaves of delicate satiny silver.

I believe from what 1 have seen of them that they are the hardiest of all. I have for two years adopted a method of preventing too rank a growth of peach seedlings. When the ground is soft, lift them with a spade, and drop them back, and stamp them solid. They will hardly be checked, and will immediately throw out a root system such as they would not have otherwise, while the tree will be slightly checked, and not so liable to be killed in the fall. I would state in conclusion, that we have made another very choice selection to come from France this spring, as our im - portal ions of a year ago for the most part were a success.

The diseases of the apple tree that have been reported as exist ing in the state on the native trees are blight, canker, root rot. black heart, crown gall. scab, powdery mildew, and rust. Those of the fruit are scab, bitter rot. brown rot. pink rot. bacterial rot. rust, and sooty fungus. I will take up the diseases in order of harmfulness as it appears this year. The Siak (Yeatsria eakwoapera). — This menace to modern apple culture is perhaps the most common and most damaging fungus foe of the orchardist. It attacks both fruit and foliage BY GEOBGE F. MILKS. LINCOLN. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">54 NEBRASKA STATE HOHTICULTURAL SOCIETY. and also creeps back on the twigs, but causes greatest loss just at the blooming season. The young fruit attacked by the fungus at this period becomes blighted and falls from the tree. This is many times attributed to insufficient nourishment for the 1 imperfect pollination, and cold and wet during blooming season. It is true that the above named factors have something to do with the non-setting of the fruit, but the scab fungus is more re - sponsible for the loss than all the other factors combined. Not only does the scab cause heavy loss from dropping after blooming. but it attacks the fruit which escapes at that time. Such fruit may. and usually does, remain upon the tree, but the growth is interfered with and the apple is distorted, and many times the fruit is so small, irregular, rough or blotched that both the com mercial and eating values are reduced. The scab, when first noticed with the naked eye. is a small brownish patch with vague, indefinite outlines, which in a short time becomes definite. It is true many times that the market value of the fruit is not apparently reduced and the orchardist does nothing to check the disease. ITowever. when the disease is worse, there are solid black patches, from a quarter of an inch to an inch or more in diameter. The latter is only more developed as the conditions for growth have been more favorable and is now a thick corky scab which is usually circular. In peeling the fruit, the affected parts come off with the rind, unless the attack is severe, when the flesh of the fruit, as well as the skin, becomes corky. It will be found that the greater part of the apples affected by scab are most seriously injured on the lower half of the apple as it hangs. This is due to the better growth of the fungus on wet or damp surface than on the upper part, where the dew and rain tend to dry up quicker. We see the cause of the scab is the fungus which spreads its branching threads over a portion of the surface and from place to place, it enters the apple and then the spores are in time formed about the edge of the scab and as they are very small, can be readily blown from place to place.

If twigs arc affected, the fungus can be checked by spraying with Bordeaux mixture and Paris green or London pur pie. First spray with copper sulphate solution, one pound to fifteen gallons of water, before the buds break in the spring soon as the blossom buds are well formed, and again as soon a the blossoms fall, the trees should be treated with Bordeaux mix ture and Paris green. Repeat in two or three weeks with sam kind of solution. If the weather is rainy, spraying should be more frequent, as the solution is washed off the foliage and fruits, leaving them exposed to the fungus, which under the warm, damp condition is more active than during a dry time. Sooty Fungus (Phyllmchorm pomiyena). — In wet seasons and especially in damp, shady and low situations, apples are subject to the attack of a fungus which causes sooty blotches on the fruit. These spots are sooty, black, circular, and measure from a quarter to half an inch in diameter. Many times the blotches coalesce, giving the fruit a sooty, dirty appearance. The fungus, unlike the scab and bitter rot, spreads its branching tin • only on the surface and this fungus grows only in the outer I&gt;ortion of the epidermis or skin. The dis&lt; us to *\&lt;: after the apples are stored as well as when on the trees, but while this fungus does not materially damage the eating quality, it does to a marked extent reduce the commercial value. The Preventive. — Aside from selecting a high, sunny situation for the apple orchard, spraying with Bordeaux mixture will pre - vent this spot. One spraying may at the time the apples are the size of hickory nuts, prevent all or nearly all of the injury. Such varieties as Maiden's Blush. (Jriines' (lolden. and others with delicate colored skin should be sprayed a little earlier than just stated. Bitter Rot (CHoMpwittM frucfigmimm) . — There is no other disease as destructive to the apple fruit as is the one commonly known as bitter rot. This disease is a rapid worker, as is seen when a rijK' apple is inoculated with it. In the course of ten or </seg>

Eeen diiys. tin 1 apple is worthless for table use or CQWCTCially. is is the case only with varieties which arc susceptible as the u Davis or Grimes' Golden. Appmnmct of th&lt; I&gt;i&gt; Anyone can identify the disease as it &lt;&gt;&lt;•&lt; -iii's on the growing apple. The points of infection vary from half a dozen to nearly countless numbers, but usually there are only a few. At first, these are minute brown spots. ]&gt;ater they develop and Income quite conspicuous, dark colored, circular -. which, while preserving their circular form and definite outline, gradually enlarge until they are nearly three-fourths of an inch in diameter. This spot does not become soft at first but mken. and if the conditions are favorable for its growth, as moist, warm, cloudy weather, this sj&gt;ot becomes dull and leathery in the center while the edge has the glossy appearance of health. If the moisture remains for a few days, the fungus which has developed in the apple causes little pustules to rise in concentric circles beginning near the center of the spot and working out - ward. These in time exude a sticky juice which contains the sj&gt;ores. The juice is readily soluble in water, and during rains, dissolved and spreads the spores by the splashing of the drops and thus the apples that are affected while still on the tree are attacked worse on the upper side. It seems rather queer that the apples should l»e thus affected on the upper side and the question might arise how the higher apples were affected first. If we accept the investigation of Dr. Burrill of Illinois, we can account for this. He says. "While traveling through the country, their attention was called to the fact that the trees which had bitter rot on the fruit also had a certain kind of canker, and that the first apples were infected from the spores dropping from the fungus growth which caused the canker." Intive. — Dr. Burrill says that the experiments they carried . go to show that the Bordeaux mixture will check the disease d if the spraying has l&gt;een practiced the orchard will not be ected.

Bnrrill, in sj&gt;eaking of canker, divides it into "apple-tree and bitter-rot canker." He they differ widely. The bitter-rot canker occurs on twigs and small branches while the canker of the tree aypwn on any j&gt;art of the tree. He says also the bitter-rot canker is often &lt;;i either by an injury, as a bruise from a hail stone or by the wind twisting the branch. Then the sj&gt;ores from the bitter rot of the apples find their way into the injury and start the fungus growth. The disease on the twigs appears similar to the apple-tree canker. The preventive is the same as is stated in connection with the bitter-rot. The Appi.e-tree Tanker. — The fungus which attacks the apple, quince, pear and other trees causing the roughening and cracking of the bark either on the twigs, branches or trunk is usually called canker. The first sign of this disease is a small discol area upon the bark in the spring, which gradually spreads as the fungus grows. Growth does not continue during mid summer, but lies dormant ready to enlarge the diseased area in the spring or to attack in new spots. After this disease has been at work for some time, it is very noticeable because of dark, enlarged tions with rough, shaggy bark upon them. Sometimes, as in the sun-scald, the wood is laid bare, but not usually. Canker grows extends along the branch more rapidly than around it. When the canker girdles the branch, it cuts off the food supply from that part above, hence the branch must die. Preventive. — Bordeaux mixture sprayed as for scab, chi the disease and some experiment stations advocate winter spray ing with lime (unslackedi thirty pounds, tallow four pounds, and salt five pounds. Dilute enough with water to make it spray easily through a fine nozzle. Root Rot. — This disease has been reported by only a very few orchardists. but is found in the state. Usually the fungus which causes the decay of the roots attacks the smaller ones first, then gradually works its way up these into the larger ones and enters </seg>

It sometimes happens that tl diseased part is on the main root just a few inches below tl crown. It is easily seen that with a diseased root system, th amount of food will be reduced and the turning yellow of th leaves is the first noticeable symptom. The bark then withei and usually the fruit becomes wrinkled and drops. The tree sometimes will die on one side and perhaps bear another crop o the live branches of the other. The Oklahoma station holds, tha this root rot is caused by a fungus which is found on cherry apple, and also on some decayed forest tree stumps. The\ the threads will find their way through the ground from ten 1 fifteen feet and that there is no connection between this dis and any manner of grafting, budding, transplanting, or shipping Preventive. — Isolate tree or trees by a ditch and burn the branches in it to kill fungus that may be there. Dig tree and roots and burn. Experiments with about fifteen pounds of un - slacked lime mixed in about the roots seemed to kill the fungus when it first attacked the tree and the tree revived. Crown Gall. — This disease is not common to the state, al though it has been reported and si&gt;eciinens have been sent in during the past years, but none recently. Some crown galls are caused by nematodes or eel-worms. This disease works on the roots of the apple tree usually just below the ground and a swell - ing or knot develops varying from half an inch in diameter to the size of your fist. The diseased part looks very much like the work of the wooly aphis only that the enlarged tissue is spongy and the bark is roughened, while with the aphis it is solid and the bark is smooth. Preventive. — Destroy the trees by digging and burning. DISCUSSION. Question — Tell us about crown gall. Mr. Miles — No doubt a great many are interested in crown gall. The only way to work up is by experience. We are working on it and intend to make a more thorough study. </seg>

The only way we can come to a more thorough understanding of crown gall, is to have you join in with us. What we have got to do is to catch the thing that is causing this disease. A. J. Brown — The only thing to do is to be careful of it. We have not seen enough of it in the state to injure the trees to any great extent. I would like to know something more about the rust. Professor Sheldon — During the summer there were qui number of sjH'ciinens sent in of rust on apples. On some trees, in certain localities, the rust caused considerable damage. It seemed to be worse near red cedars. One gentleman asked me what to do with his cedar trees. I suggested that he cut down all the red cedars in the neighborhood. The rust begins to show on the apples in .July and August. In some places, where the apple trees were affected, they vm as yellow in August as they should have been in November. A Member — How far will this rust spread from the cedar? Professor Emerson — The spores of the cedar fungus have been known to carry eight miles by the wind. It seems that the only way to avoid this trouble is to cut down the cedars. If you want one of them you must get rid of the other. PICKING AND MARKETING APPLES. BY E. F. STEPHENS. CRETE. In discussing this topic I would like first to quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes. — "The training of a child should commence two hundred years before it is born." To attain perfection in any line requires careful preparation. If an orchard has been planted on suitable soil, carefully cultivated, pruned and sprayed. </seg>

We have found it l&gt;est to make three or four successive pickil For The first, about July Hi. select such as are large enough to cook and also show some color. The removal of half the fruit in the first and second pickings relieves the over-laden tree and allows the third and fourth pickings to swell to larger size. Apples swell in size rapidly during the last week of growth. The orchardist wavers l&gt;etweeu a desire to avail himself of the letter prices of an early market, and a later picking where he secures more bushels. Tender fleshed summer varieties must be picked and marketed while yet solid, or they will not hold up to time to market. This is especially true with such variety Red .June and Whitney No. M.

With favorable weather and sufti - soil moisture many of the cull apples become number 2, and seconds are swelled and colored to a better grade. Cultivation into September or even October assists in changing low grade fruit into merchantable apples. PREPARATIONS KuR PICKING. For shipment of summer apples, secure in advance the required number of ventilated barrel*. They can usually Ik&gt; parch early in the season at a lower price than after the denuiud lieoomes active. Winter apples are marketed in barrels of . quality that nearly exclude air. Summer apples are usually sold in less costly barrels, and are picked and hauled to the packing - house where they ate handled out of the sun. Time is saved in handling winter apples by having a large movable packing table upon which they can be emptied and rapidly graded into barrels. If they are intended for immediate con - sumption, they may lx- picked in grain-sacks tied cornerwise and slung over the shoulder. If fruit is of such quality as to require more careful handling, provide drop bail baskets lined with burlap, and plenty of light ladders ten to fifteen feet in height should also 1m- at hand. To head the barrels, we use a bail lever -. which we regard as quicker than a screw pi PACK At this time our trade prefers the three bushel barrel for nearly all varieties and grades. With average labor packing in barrels is more rapid than in lxtxes. To grade with such accuracy that a given numl»er of layers will exactly till a box and receive the right pressure requires more exjx'rt help than the average onhardist can secure. The major portion of the crop of summer apples is shipped to village merchants in one to the barrel lots to be retailed by the |&gt;eek. For summer apple* we use the venti lated barrel with notched staves. </seg>

Apples intended fur coamraption duriug December and later tould be picked with extreme ewe, graded to a higher standard lan bulk shipments, and barreled.

The barrel is then filled ith regular grade, shaking it five and six times while filling, to I sure that the fruit is as compactly packed as possible.

After nailing this head and liners. ie barrel is reversed and the variety marked on the faced end. hich now becomes the top. When the head is removed later, ie fruit looks much more attractive by reason of the even, well •lored facing. MARKETING THROUGH VILLAGE .MERCHANTS. During the months of July and August apples must be shipped n small lots by local freight or express. The orchardist who ias by careful work and good fruit built up a wide trade, can pe the middle profit of the jobl&gt;er or commission man bj hipping day by day to a circle of customers lifty to three hundred niles distant.

PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF HORTKTI/nUK IX NEBRASKA. .1//-. I'nxitlciit ami Member* of the State Horticultural Society: The subject assigned me by the committee for this meeting is "The Past. Present, and Future of Horticulture in Nebraska." I suppose they wanted me to review the past, extol the present, and prophesy for the future of horticulture in our state. The first nursery in the territory was started by Hon. J. 11. .Masters, adjoining Nebraska City in 1S54. who ran it successfully for two or three decades, and is the pioneer in Nebraska as far as I know. Two years later, in lS."»(i. a Mr. Bird Vowell came from Iowa and planted a thirty acre orchard in London, Nemaha county, on sod freshly broke. It was the wonder of the neighbor - hood, where it is remembered that the trees cost from 75 cents to f 1 each and had to Ik- shipjted from back in America, as it was then called, by steamltoat and stage -coach, and then from oO to 7."&gt; per cent of them dead on arrival. All eyes were ui&gt;on Vowell's orchard. The tree* grew and waxed strong, but seemed they out of their latitude, as they went to wood and not to fruit. The knowing ones would shake their heads and say no use. Nebraska would never 1m- a fruit-growing country. If I remem ber, that orchard never bore a good crop until it was fifteen years i:y w. •;. swan, tecumseh. </seg>

The gophers would conic from neighboring farms to get the succulent roots of those apple trees, often felling trees from six to eight inches in diameter. Mr. Vowell would trap and dig them out with a spade, often taking a half day to dig out some wise old gopher, who would obstinately refuse to go in a trap. If Mr. Vowell had known that a little strychnine and parsnip would have done the business, he probably would have been in Nebi yet, but fighting gophers and rabbits, and getting no apples, he sold out in 1S(&gt;7 and went to Oregon, where he thought he would grow fruit. Along in the sixties, when railroads In'gan to touch the .Missouri river, there was quite an imj»etus given to orchardin. trees got cheaj&gt;er. came through quicker and in l&gt;etter condition. Small orchards bcgU to dot many of our homes, and as the soil beeanie tamer it was l&gt;etter adapted to fruit, trees bearing fair crops several years younger than those planted before the sixties. Since 1880 thousands and thousands of fruit trees have been planted and seem to be as much at home as anywhere in the Inited States. Peaches in an early day were very discouraging to the orchard - is every two or three years the trees would winter kill, thousands of trees grew and died without ever having any blossoms, much less fruit. Along about IMt we tiegan to have some success, our climate evidently changing or the trees we now have being hardier. We now have some peaches every year. In the cold winter of lMHt when the thermometer r&gt; i 32° below zero, our trees came through without serious loss and we had a few peaches. I l&gt;elieve if we would save pits from the hardiest, we might improve them to stand 40 In-low zero have two old stumps fifteen years old. not very ornamental, but can rely on them every year for a few peaches. Pears do not like the rich soil of Nebraska, but are partly remunerative on our poorest soil. The main trouble is blight. Like hog cholera, when a tree gets it. it dies. If pruned, it only makes it like cholera medicine with the hog. seems to die easier. </seg>
            <seg id="p065">66 NEBRASKA STATE HOBTHUI/IT KAI. 8OCIBTY. Would plant a few on poorest land and never bother them after the first year. Seems pretty rough for them, but my observation is they are the fellows who bring pears to market. Plums are a failure with me at least. I set 500 seven years ago, planting every alternate row with different kinds, for fertilization, accord - ing to the hooks. Always have plenty of bloom but no fruit to speak of. Ten bushels in 1900 was my best. Mr. President, the past, present and future of plums has no charms for me. Grapes, currants, cherries, raspberries, gooseberries, and straw berries seem to be at home in Nebraska. Only give them good care and you are reasonably sure of a crop. The present, to use slang, is too utterly utter for pen t&lt; describe. Our present crop for 1902 is 150 per cent ahead &lt;&gt; anything we ever had before. For size, color, soundness am flavor they are world l&gt;eauties. Missouri with her little ret apples is not in it this year, and Iowa, having not heard from In - last fall, suppose she must have some few good apples or w would have shipped her more. Only three cars went from on town to Iowa this last fall. One word about the future and I will close this harangue. We are at present ahead of our sister states. Last fall buyers came up through Missouri and Kansas, bought our crop and shipped them to Omaha, Kansas City, and Chicago for cold storage. From there they distributed them to all parts of the United Si Europe, and the Orient for consumption by all the people of the world. In closing, just let me say I believe the future of horticulture in Nebraska will be what we as fruit growers make it. Standing as we do to-day, ahead of any state in the Union in our magni - ficent crop of 1902. it behooves us to be up and doing, to maintain our magnificent record of the past year, keeping out of hailing distance of Iowa, Kansas. Missouri, and Illinois. Granting they are great states for cattle, corn, and hogs, let us continue mixing fruit with our cattle, corn, and hogs, and our people will live long and be prosperous and happy. [Applause.] </seg>

Then the facts are dealt with when the last of the crop is marketed, and the memory of the dull, sickening thud when you lit makes the prospect good that you will increase the area planted to potatoes and cabbage next year. You will say. "He is not an optimist." Yet I am an optimist on strawberries as a money crop. But the wonder to me is that any one ever makes a success when we consider the fact that there are thousands of varieties, and not twenty that are productive and have size and quality that will enable you to realize a profit on time and investment. And it takes years of discouragement to separate the grain from the chaff. I have tested hundreds of the so-called leading varieties and have only found six that I would set for profit, and would reduce that number to four but for the fact that some prospective patrons wish to cater to the taste, while others wish to please the eye. During the fourteen years that I have grown it. I have never found any variety that will equal the No. 2 when prop - erly fertilized. I have grown many kinds that will produce much larger specimens, and in one single instance I realized almost as much cash from an equal area of Bubach No. ."&gt;. I had a market for extra large l&gt;erries and received almost twice as much per quart for them as I did for the Warfield. I have grown the Sample since its introduction and have found it a close second. From the tests I have made, if I were going to set an acre of this fruit.

I would set one-fourth acre with Sample fertilized by Ridgeway. and one - fourth acre with lUibach No. 5 fertilized by either Gardner or Fountain. With these six varieties, proper location of bed and good culture, nine ye;irs in ten you will have a big crop of berries that will sell at top prices on any market.

I have used eighty twahorse loads on one acre, and it gave better results than did sixr any less amount. I have raised one-fourth acre without the use of a horse after the ground was conditioned before plants were set, and had a far greater yield of more even sized berries than a like area treated identically the same in all other respects but this: the first plot was cultivated with hoe and garden rake, the latter plot with horse and Planet.

"Thai &lt;&gt;w for me." Such people usually gather their apples with a club instead of a ladder, trot their horses while cultivating their corn, turn their stock into their corn to save gathering it, and about January 1st go to their neighbor who "plods," as they term it, and borrow enough money to square the short side of the ledger. I would prefer to get a full crop from one acre to getting one fifth of a crop from five acres. The ideal mulch, so far as I have been able to secure, is ghum. Sow about July 15th very thick.

I would answer, patronize home industries at all times where ]&gt;ossible. even to the extent of paying a little more for them. In case you cannot get what you want near home, send to any reliable grower, anywhere north of the Ohio river and west of the Allegheny mountains. I have had as good results from Michigau grown plants. ;is I ever had from my own raising (and they were not the so-called "Pedigree" plants either). I want to say right here, that the man who will study the environments that are the only possible cause of bud variation, will succeed a great deal better than the man who propagates from plants which, on account of some soil or other advantages, produce a greater quantity of better quality of fruit than some other plant of the same variety that has been starved into nnfruitfulness. Every plant of any one variety is a part of every other plant of that variety, and must contain iden - tically the same inherent properties if they are treated identically une. and will produce identically alike. I am not in favor of irrigating the plant propagating bed. The strawberry is a "gormand." yet a sluggard if food and moisture are placed so that it does not have to make any effort to get it. There will be an abnormal top growth and very little root growth, and what little there is is of a spike-like growth and little or no fibrous growth, and consequently are not supplied with food gatherers sufficient to enable them to make a good growth when transplanted. I very much prefer to place the food well under them and retain moisture in the ground by continuous cultiva tion. You will not get so large a plant, but a much more evenly balanced top root growth. There is a time when irrigation will it almost any cost, and that is from the time the first bloom appears until the last berry is picked. It is hard to get too much water during this period. The last thing to be done be - fore the ground freezes is to take a single shovel plow and make trench in the center between the rows, and the rows to be </seg>

I should like to take an imaginary select the location, prepare the ground, mark it off, set it out, cultivate and mulch it. and give my reasons for each move, bnt time will not permit, and with a few remarks will dm Do not set vnur plants until, by opening the leaves, you can ii occasional fruit bud. as by this method the plant will make no further effort to produce fruit, and you not only save the labor of picking off the fruit stems, but will have very much stronger plants. But my tests have proven to me that you will third more fruit the following year. Always get one-tenth more plants than will set the l&gt;ed, and heel in the surplus in sand made quite wet. Set the plants in rows just so no one plant will touch any others. Three weeks after setting out the bed. go over it and dig up and throw away all plants that are weak, and fill in where any are missing, as a vacant space in the row takes the same labor as though there were plants there. After a bed has fruited once, my method for preparing it for ■ second crop, is to go it carefully with a two horse stirring plow and turn it up side down, at least eight inches deep. A new bed is cheaper and 100 per cent, better. Many persons have purchased plants from me and followed directions exactly as given until the plants were set, and then turned them loose with the weeds, and blamed me for swindling them, as I had a large crop of fine berries, and of course, they had none. They remind me of the boy who killed his father and mother and, when the judge was about to sentence on him. asked the court to 1k» lenient with him. as he was an orphan. He had just as much right to expect leniency on his pretext, as the man has to expect a crop without caring for his plants. Spasmodic enthusiasm will not win in strawberry culture. Such people as the above should set only Crescent Seedling fer - tilized by either Captain Jack or Charles Downing, as they will almost kill out white clover or blue grass, and by the way. are near the head of the list with good treatment. If I wished for </seg>

I have fruited the Rough Rider since its first introduction. It is quite productive of large berries, but too much of a prohibition - ist to suit me. as it absolutely refuses to color its nose. The most handsome berry I ever grew was the Anna Kennedy. The best flavored was the Qypay. The largest has also the distinction of being the poorest in quality. It is the Mary. The most ex - asperating, promising, never fulfilling is a trio, the Clyde, Brandywine. and Glen Mary. I will not try to give an accurate description of the way they have acted with me, as I have been taught not to use the language BMOMVJ to express my thoughts. I have grown the Nick Olnner for four years. It is the best plant of them all. but as I have never seen any berries of this variety, I cannot say as to their size, shape or quality. Any person who owus or can rent a small tract of land should plant enough of this fruit for family use, as there is no fruit that can be grown so quickly or so much of it on so small an area ;is can be grown of strawberries.

I was intensely interested in what a gentleman from Kansas had to say. We will have to drop down into Kansas and touch upon the results that have heen accomplished in this line. I have been a great many years in the study of cultivation, but only in the lust few years have I given attention to fruit or tree growing. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">75 SOU. CI'I.TIRK. I will mention the uaptakiaee of Mr. McAllum. who in 1895 planted an orchard of two and a half acres in the northwest cor - ner of Kansas. This orchard contains peaches, plums, cherries, and apples. There was sold from this orchard, in the year of 1902, $200 worth of fruit outside of what was used for family purposes. 1 do not Ix'lieve there is an orchard in any par eastern Nebraska, that is in a healthier apj&gt;earance than Mr. McAllum reported this year. In (irnhnni county we planted !M54 trees. These trees made a mammoth grmrtfc Teach trees that measured one inch in diameter, measured two and a half inches the following spring, the direct result of insistent cul - tivation. I am working in the western part of the state. My exj&gt;erience has all l&gt;een in that part. 1 am firmly of the opinion that on the high level prairies of northwestern Kansas and southwestern Nebraska, fruit growing will be a success. We have got to the pout where this (piestion can be controlled. 1 have found it im - portant to note closely this condition : when the soil is simply moist, not wet or dry, it is in the proper condition to work. If we catch our soil just at this particular time, it readily sepai into minute particles. We have read a good deal in the past of the dust mulch. The dust blanket will not hold the moisture as long as the small lumps. I want to touch just a little bit upon the corn, wheat, etc., as related to the development of the western part of the state. Forty miles east of Denver, on the Kansas branch of the Union Pacific railroad, a Mr. 1'. Jensen raised forty bushels of corn per acre by the conserving of the moisture. They are now thoroughly convinced that they can raise corn in that section. l&gt;own in Franklin county the hot. dry jK'riod early in August did a great deal of damage. One gentleman in that vicinity culti - vated three times after the rest had laid by. and by this method secured an increase of 2.000 bushels on eighty acres. He said if he had hired the help it would have cost him $28. In ltOl, during the extreme drouth, it was astonishing how the corn held out. You frequently heard the remark. "A few more days of this kind </seg>

While this year only fourteen a of dry weather with only five days of extreme heat prac - tically ruined it. Now. why this marked difference, since the rain ceased in LM1 before we stopped cultivation, while the rain continued after we ceased cultivation in 10(12? Gentlemen. I thank you. [Applause.] Mit. Hartley — What has l&gt;een your experience in orchard cul - tivation? Mr. CampmLL — I have had very little experience in the orchard. The President — I suppose Mr. Hartley will have to answer his own question, as he has proliably had more experienee than any other man in the room. Mr. Hartley — I got a very large wood growth. The trees did splendidly, hut no fruit. LMr. I'oi.laiu) — I do not know whether I can answer the (pies on or not. I can relate our own cxperienc» down in &lt;"ass county. We had very much the same experience that he had in raising ipples. We always gave thorough cultivation. Two years ago we neglected our orchard and it grew up to weeds. We have a •ich soil down there, and of course had a rank growth of weeds. The nexi year we let it go again. We let it go without any cul - ivation at all. The next year we had quite a few apples on this MUM orchard. So this last year we did not cultivate and the result was that we had the largest crop of fruit we ever had. This year we harvested apples from trees that were four and five i younger than they usually hear. I beHere that when the orchard is well under way. all cultivation should Ik- stopped. Check the growth of the wood and help the fruit. Mr. Barnes — The majority of our horticulturists cultivate corn in their orchards for the first five years, and seed down to clover. With the clover will l&gt;e found more or le&gt;s weeds. Judge Well house has a large roller with knives similar to a stalk cutter that he runs over his orchard twice in the season. This machine breaks down the weeds, cuts Them up and leaves them all on the grand. We think this makes a good mulch and fertilizer. </seg>

Officer* ii ml Member* of the State Horticultural Society — Gentlemen: In submitting herewith my article on U B &lt;iardening"' I wish to state that plants herein mentioned are only those which are able to withstand our climate, and such as are really useful as a garden or house plant. In the early spring, after the frost is well out of the ground, is the time to start work on the garden. Turning over the soil is necessarily the tirst course to Ik' taken, and by spading in a &lt;|iiantity of well rotted horse or cow manure you are assured of a stronger and faster growth. Sweet peas can l*&gt; planted very early. — in fact, earlier than any other seed that I can think of at this moment. If you desire very early sweet peas, make a trench about six inches deep, on well drained soil; the l&gt;est results are obtained if trenches run north and south. After the seeds are planted and covered, the hollow is still about four inches deep, the idea iu having this trench is so as to l&gt;e able to cover if frost is threatened, and later in the season to run water in. as they flourish lienutifully under this treatment. A hot-bed is a very useful addition to a beginner or amateur. A small one is made in the following way : Make a wooden frame of one-inch luml&gt;er: south end alxmt six inches above ground and north end about twelve inches; the width can ht determined on the numlKT of sash you intend using. The sash are three b feet in size, and glazed with ten by twelve glass. Suppose ours is three feet wide by six feet long, north and south. After the frame is fitted to the sash, the frame is dug out to the depth "f two or three feet, dejtending on the heat you wish to obtain, then fill in with fresh horse manure to within twelve inches of the top. leave for several days, or until the teinj&gt;erature has lowered to for otherwise the temperature will register 100 . which is too high. Then add six or eight inches of a 1. and finish with fine soil, and your hot lied is complete. I i having KY J. 1C. HATH. OMAHA. </seg>

SOCIETY. a hot-bed, or cariag to make oae, can sow their weds in plats, or shallow boxes, set in the window, and cover with glass to keep the moisture in. Seeds of plants wanted for summer blooming should now be selected, but what do you want? Let us glance over the list. There are asters, nasturtiums, pan verlN'iias. and sweet alyssum. and then forget-me-nots, salvia. snap-dragons, marigolds, storks, and vineas are there too. while we must not overlook petunias, four-o'elooks. mignonette, car nations and coxcomb, and for very late blooming cosmos can be had. The following are a few eUnben: Moonflower. Cobm scan dens. Japanese morning glory and several varieties of gourd, for an odd clbnber are popular. All of these should have a south - ern exposure. The plants named so far can all l&gt;e grown from seed, and the hot-bed conies in handy to make an early start. The seeds are sown in patches, and labeled, covered of course with the glass sash. If cold weather sets in again, some long manure thrown over the glass will l&gt;e sufficient protection. After several weeks. or after the character leaf shows, the little seedlings should be transplanted in two rows, an inch each way. and will make fair plants by setting out time, about May If. The spring has now advanced enough to decide what is wanted in hardy and perennial plants. One almost thinks of roses first. and that is a subject so broad, you can hardly make a mistake. The best known, as well as the most popular red rose, is the^ General Jacqueminot, a new variety. Jubilee is also good. Madam l'lantier is a very good white. In pink roses Ilie list is very long. Here are a few of the best : Magma Cfcarta, Le Heine. Captaia Christy. I'aul Xeyron. La France, and I might add the American beauty. Climbing roses are very popular, and the Rambler family are most in demand. They come in four colors. — crimson, yellow. white, and pink. The Crimson Rambler is the most popular, and the most lH'antiful. and though small, the flowers come in g </seg>

While on this subject, other climbers are also available, such as clematis, of which C. paniculata is the best grower, and the hardiest. Japanese hop, Virginia creeper, wisteria and Boston ivy. This last named clings to stone or brick, and is used much for covering stone walls. There are such a vast number of hardy bloomers that thrive well in our climate, so 1 will not attempt to mention but a few of the most popular. The large family of iris (oMM call them Hags) have many varieties that do well in our country, and these are used mi for borders. Hydrangea paniculata is a very popular bush, being the last to bloom, and hold their heads of lower way into December. Coreopsis, phlox, rndbeckia, foxglove, hollyhocks, peoaioi sweet william make up a small list of hardy stock. Lily ofthe - valley must not be overlooked, for there is nothing that on&lt; be more proud of than a patch of liliesof-the-valley. Many ad - vocate planting in the shade of trees, but the tinest patch I saw was in the open on a terrace or sh&gt;i&gt;e facing north. Suppose spring has now advanced to say. May 10, and our « in the hot-bed has shown results, we must prepare to set them out. After deciding where we want them, the soil is again gone over, and pulverized. beeMM our plants are rather small, and by exercising care in lifting from hotbed, plant into position half inch lower than originally, water with spray, and if the sun is shining, some shading is necessary. Now for a few things we could buy no seeds of: Cosmos should not 1h» passed by. for a brighter and more desirable plant is not to 1m i had. They come in various colors, bordering on the red ami yellow, and vary in height, from two and a half to six feet. Dahlias, too. are popular. Specialists have made great progress with this plant in the last five years, ('alodium, or elephant's - ear, is the plant par excellence for a l&gt;ed of foliage.

The ooleus are used mostly for edging &lt;&gt;n canna or geranium beds. or by themselves. Many l&gt;eds of striking contrast are to be almost anywhere. Everything has now l&gt;een planted, but we must give consider - able attention to watering, weeding, and staking, if i* The soil should always Ik- kept loose for blooming plants, as well as corn, as they will not give l&gt;est results unless they have an sioual stirring. You have, no doubt, enjoyed yourselves a great deal during the past summer picking flowers, weeding, watering and giving your plants the care they needed, but autumn is now drawing near, and we must think of winter and early spring. Tulips, crocus, daffodils, narcissus, hyacinths, lilies, and other bulbs of this order, can Ik- set out now. Septeml&gt;er is the proper time, because the bulbs should make many roots Wfore the ground freezes. The south side of the house is preferable. After you have selected what bulbs you want, prepare your bed and plant the tall growing farthest from your walk, and so graduate them towards the lowest, thereby making a mass of color when they come into bloom. These bulbs should be set about four inches under the ground, with about five inches of leaves, straw, and litter to protect them from the early spring sun. Should you want some of the Dutch hyacinths for the house, plant them in four-inch pots of loose sandy loam, and after one thorough watering, set in dark corner in the cellar. Water every two weeks, and after January 15 bring to light and water more liberally. The question now arises. 'What shall I have as house plants for winter?

The seore taiy asked me some five or six weeks ago to take a place on th program. 1 am a great fellow not to follow my subject. I hardl. know where I will leave off. when I get on a subject. I travel over the state a great deal and talk horticulture to a great many jK-ojde. We work at it all the time. Our room is in the state house. The state of Kansas supports us and provides for us a home. I like to talk horticulture. I have no paper for you this afternoon, and I thought for a while I did not have any thing ell Commercial horticulture is a big subject, some of you realize that. I want to start a little back of that and talk horticulture for the family. Every man who has a little patch of ground ought to get as many food things out of it as possible. We have in our town about :{.(»()() employes of the Santa Fe Railroad Company. If I talk of home or myself, do not think I am boasting, for I know of these as they come under my observation. These ;{,(&gt;(&gt;() em - ployes live largely in the roundhouse, but some have their own homes. If a man has only a small piece of ground in the back yard. I contend that lie can have some of the real good things for his table, and the man who raises these things to sell is not inter- I with by the man who raises a little bit in his own backyard. You will find you can sell to these, who like fruit, the year round. They are the In-st customers, and will depend upon the grocery men and commission men the remainder of the vear.

One beaatifnl thing about the straw - berry is that a man can grow all the lorries he wants for his family from a small patch. When starting for Kansas. I pui strawberry plants in one of these round ]&gt;each baskets. We had to travel by hack for a long distance. From Columbus the hack man refused to haul them any farther, saying he had all he could haul. We went on and the plants followed a week later. Our claim in Montgomery county was located by our running a line from LalK'tte county, which we thought was correct. Then we planted our strawberries out. Afterward the county survc came along and we found we were on the wrong side of the line and had to move our plants. Finally the government survi came along and we had to move them the third time. I!y this time they lM'gan to vine, and the 256 plants had dwindled down to tvrenty-tive. This was in 1871, and in 1873 my patch was about half as big as this room. From this small patch we had all the berries we wanted. Usides suppying our friends with plants. This was my early experience with strawlxTries in Kansas.

Mr. Swan -I want the birds to stay on their own side of the line and keep their place. Let them have the mullM'rrics. but pro - tect the cherries. Ms. P&gt;akni:s i continuing) — Another thing T would have would be five acres of land for every schoolhouse. Two acres for a grove, where all church people can go and hold their meetings, without regard to denomination. The whole neighborhood ought to have a claim on that grove. One acre for lawns, flower beds. etc. Ixt one boy have charge of these. Then take a boy who has ■ mechanical eye. and give him the gates and fences. Make him the responsibility of it. Then there should be two acres for the play ground. Let another boy have charge of this. I would put up swings and have croquet sets.

I agree with him on the sehoolhouse grounds, but I would have another boy there. I would have him watch the little birds. I would have them cared for by this boy just as carefully as he would care for his own sister. The man who is raising cherries is not doing what he should unless he plants •Kough for himself and birds too. An educated man. who ought to know about these things, can tell us that from &lt;&gt;0 to M i&gt;er cent of the food of birds is insects. I have had a little experience along this line. I had a neighbor who had an immense crop of cherries. I visited him and he told me about his crop. In walking through the orchard, we actually trampled on dead birds. He had shot birds from the time the crop had l&gt;eguii to ripoi until it had gone. He said to me. "Von will come to this just as sure as you | crop of cherries." I told him I never could, thiit I could not do su&lt; !i a thing as that. Hut when I got my tirst crop of cherries. I got my little rifle out, and out of every dozen shots I downed about nine or ten birds. I shot these little fellows until they were so thick on the ground I had to remove them. Afterwards my conscience hurt me. The bird is (lod's own insecticide. Kvery man ought to care for the birds. It ought to be talked in ■ horticultural meeting. When we do this, and do the i spraying, we will raise letter fruit and be in better condition to advance the lines of commercial horticulture. [Applause.] </seg>
            <seg id="p085">86 NEBRASKA STATE HORTIt'l I.Tl UAL SOCIETY. PRELIMINARY PAPER ON DISEASES OF GRAPES IN NEBRASKA. BY CHARLES E. BE8REY. Compl&amp;inti have conie to me of some trouble with the grape crop the past season, and inquiry has shown that while in nearly all cases it was injured, there is a good deal of differed (.pinion as to its nature and cause. No less than eight to teu diseases of the graj&gt;e are eomnionly known in the United States. but none a p] tear to agree fully with the descriptions which have been given me of the trouble as it existed the past year iu Nebraska. It may be well to briefly describe the diseases which are common on the grape, and which are found or are likely to Ik' found on it sooner or later in Nebraska. They are as follows: Anthracnoxc. a disease of the berries in which the skin become di'.rk reddish-brown in spots or specks, which increase in si/. until they are alnrnt a quarter of an inch in diameter. The mai gins are always reddish or brown in color, but the centers tun gray whfn the spots are full size. The •fleeted, l&gt;erries eventual!, dry up and become hard and shriveled. On some of the specimen sent me in the early part of this winter I found the characteristi 8jK)ts of this disease, and so can say that it was present in som parts of the state last season. Bitter Hot is another disease of the lierries which starts much as the Anthracnose. by a reddish or brownish discoloration of the skin. There are no distinct spots, and the flesh is soon intensely bitter to the taste. As the disease progresses the berries shrivel and drop off. I have no evidence that this disease is in Nebraska. Black Rot is a disease of the berries which in the East is regarded as one of the most troublesome of those with which the grape grower has to contend. The green berries become spotted with dark or black spots and soon rot. but here the berries do not fall off. but dry up and remain as black, shriveled objects on the vines, and as the fungus is alive in these old berries, it is carried over from one year to the other in this way. From some descriptions which I have of the grape trouble in Nebraska the </seg>
            <seg id="p086">87 year. I am inclined to think that a part of it was due to the Black Rot. Brown Rot affects the leaves, twigs, and berries. At first whitish, downy patches are to be seen on the affected parts, and Inter these turn brown. The diseased berries wither and eventually become dark brown in color. This disease is known to occur in Nebraska, and I have repeatedly found it on grape vices in Lincoln. Powdery Mildew is primarily a disease of the leaves and twigs, but in severe cases it affects the berrin also. Tt shows itself by a whitish powdery growth on the surface of the leaves and twigs, and by a similar growth on the berries, this growth eventually turning darker in color, especially on the berries. In some cases the berries crack open on account of the injury to the skin which the disease produces. This disease is common in Nebr; especially in damp weather, but it rarely if ever proves to Ik 1 a serious trouble. Several other diseases might be mentioned, but as they are quite certainly not related to the present trouble in Nebraska. I will not take space for describing them here. Now which of the foregoing have been concerned with the gra|»e crop of Nebraska the past season? Allow me at this point to quote from some of the letters written in answer to my inquiries. Om writer says that his trouble was that while the individual berries were perfect, the bunches were poorly filled out. Another says that he had few graj&gt;es. and those were of poor quality. Still another says that while his early grapes were excellent, the later ones did not mature, but rotted on the vines, hanging to the stalks by the stretched out skin. Another grower says while some of his grapes drop|&gt;ed prematurely, most of them remained on the vines, turning sour and finally drying up. A clow observer writes that while the full grown berries were alwnit as large as usual, they soon showed reddish spots as if stung by an iai and failed to ripen. Some of the grape growers refer the trouble to the uuusually wit season, while others refer it to overproduction the pre\ </seg>

Mj attention was called to this matter too late to enable me to make a thorough investigation, but from the information I have been able to get by correspondence and in conversation with grape giii wers in addition to what I have been able to make out by an examination of the dried up diseased grapes sent me during the month of December. T have arrived at the following gent nil ((inclusions: 1. That the trouble with the grape crop of 1902 was due to ;i combination of causes. 2. That some vines were in an enfeebled condition on account of the heavy crop, and severe drought of 1901. •";. That in some cases there was poor fertilization of the Howers on account of the rains. That the wet weather of 1902 favored the development of some of the more common diseases of the berries, among which are Anthracnose. Black Rot. and perhaps Brown Rot. ."&gt;. That a part of the trouble was due to a disease not yet &lt;!«• scribed, and which is possibly of bacterial origin. Here I refer to the cases where the berries became soft and flabby, hanging by the pulled out skin at the base. This needs to be carefully in\ gated. HAI. SUGGESTIONS. If I am right in my conclusions, which are tentative, and liable to modification after further investigation, we are not likely to have a recurrence of the trouble. It will be well for all who experienced any trouble whatever with their grapes to spray freely this spring so as to kill the fungi which grew so abundantly last year. This should be done more than once in order to be effective. as follows: First spraying, — just before the buds open. Second spraying, — just after the fruit has set. Third spraying, — ten days after second spraying. I'se Bordeaux mixture, in which the ingredients have the fol - lowing proportions : </seg>
            <seg id="p088">89 In preparing this, do it as follows: Dissolve the blue vitriol in two gallons of water. Slake the lime separately, using a little water only, adding more water when slaked, and pour this lime - water into the barrel containing the dissolved blue vitriol, stirring it as it is added. When well mixed, add water enough to make in all fifty gallons. DISCUSSION. Mr. Marshall — I would like to say a word here. I was sent down to Omaha last fall to procure grapes for the state fair. Of all the vineyards around Omaha, those on the south slope were very much better than those on the north. Those having a north slope were a total failure. Dr. Bessey — That is a very important point. I wish the stenographer would be sure to get that down. I would like to ask every one of you who grow grapes, that on the first appear - ance of any disease it be reported to me. THE FRUIT EXHIBIT AT THE GRAND ARMY MEETING AT WASHINGTON. Mr. President. Ladies and Gentlemen: When I noticed my name on this program, I thought it a little singular. Possibly I may have some relations with horticulture and the state of Nebraska. I always encouraged the horticulturists by buying a supply for the fall and winter. I was very much interested in seeing the display of fruit at the state fair. It captured me completely. The departmental commander was with me and I suggested to him that it would be a very nice thing to get a display of appl&lt; take with us to Washington. I was immediately made chairman of a committee to take up the matter. I consulted the Horticul- BY CAPT. J. H. CULVER, MILFORD. »ni** vitriol 4 pounds Quicklime 4 pounds &gt;Vater 50 gallons </seg>

So we made some preliminary arrangements, and the da\ before we started from the state with our offirial train we were notified that there were apples at the various depots for the G. A. R. We collected them. \\ e had some ten barrels, presented by Mr. Barnard. Mr. Youngers. Marshall Df— ., Mr. Christy. Mr. Stephens and others. We had succeeded in getting a place in the baggage car from the railroad comjmny. Arriving at Omaha, we were met by a com rade from Plattsmouth with some apples. Some of these were lalieled for the president, and some for our comrades. I expected questions to l&gt;e asked that I would be unable to answer. I knew enough about apples to know that lien Davis were the best for eat ing. when there were no others around [laughter], and that the drimes" (Jolden were the best for all purposes when all others were around. That was alxmt the extent of my knowledge. We started out with our official train. Arriving at Chicago, we laid over some time. From there we went to Niagara Falls and visited the wonderful works of nature there. Passing on down to Wash - ington, we found it particularly difficult there to secure a place for the exhibits, but finally succeeded. The gentlemen who had \olunteered to assist in this matter were busy. We very soon learned that Kansas was there. She always appears in very large numbers. Kansas is a great advertiser. We have caught a great many things from Kansas. [Laughter.] A Member — Yes. we have caught their hot-winds. [Laughter.] Mr. »Ylver — (continuing i — The grand review took place, and. as many of you know who have been in Washington, extended down to Pennsylvania avenue. Not only were the streets and by - b filled with i&gt;eople. but the house-tops, windows and ••■ thing were full. After this was over with, the people commenced sight seeing, passing around to the different places. They went up to Kansas. I had heard a great deal about Kansas. I went up there too. not in the daytime, but at night. I found they had monopolized two sides of a hotel, using the sidewalks also. They had actually planted their sunflowers right out in the streets. They had pumpkins so large, that I thought they had got them from just </seg>
            <seg id="p090">91 over the line — in Nebraska. [Laughter.] So that the city was rather wild over the Kansas exhibit. Our little exhibit dov the hotel was not drawing the crowds that the Kansas show was. We probablv had just as good a fruit exhibit. Then it w. found we had to do something. Having some acquaintances among the newspaper men. I ceived the idea of interesting them. I then hired a stenographer and dictated just as nice a letter as I was capable of. I bought some of the nicest baskets wt • &lt;&gt;uld find, and put this lettt the basket with the finest selection of apples we could get. and sent a basket of fruit to each &lt;&gt;f the varioi r men. The newspapers began to advertise Nebraska, and we n *onie attention. The crowds commenced coming, not only at a season - able hour in the morning, but at daylight, even before the p&lt; in charge were ready for them. They wanted to get in. They came and kept it up until after 12 o'clock every night. They 'vauted to know where we got our grafts from, if it was pos - to raise apples out oa the prairies of Nebraska, and where we got our fertilizers. They talked about things out west with a uncertain air. One gentleman, speaking about th&gt; "These men do not seem to understand the west." I said, they do not." Then he said. "I am surprised to hear them talk in this way. I am a western man myself. " "By the way." I "where do you live?" "I live away out in the . part of Pennsylvania." [Laughter.] There were a great many inquiries us to where the grafts for these varieties i-ould be had. and I gave the names of several of the gentlemen who make a business of growing trees. I only want to impress this idea tij»on the people, and tha if you have a good thing, push it. I think these exhibits ought to l»e kept up. that the world should know that Nebraska is some - thing of which to be proud. 1 thank you. [Applause.] Mr. Barnes — We had a little sport at the captain's expense. I lave a little joke on him. When I got rid of in .

I picked out one basket of very tine specimens, and sent it i&lt;&gt; Mr. Bncketi &lt;»f the Horticultural Department, from which to make plaster casts for the diflFerent museums. As I came back, I sjM-nt a day in Washington. I went to sec Mr. Rraekett and he said a gentlemen had been there to see if he had made casts of the specimen* of the fruit he had sent down. On inquiry he found the apples had ben secured from the Nebraska exhibit, but instead of using them for casts, as the captain had expected them to be, they had been eaten up. [Laughter.] &lt; ait UN Cri.vER — Yes, that is true. A gentleman came and asked for some specimens for casts, and I helped him sort out a basketful of the finest fruit we had, and when I heard they had been eaten, I asked him why this was. He said. '"We were hungry for apples, and as the Nebraska applet looked so much better than those of Kansas, we ate them." [Applause. Laughter.] DISEASES OF FOREST TREES. I!Y C. W. EDGERTON, LINCOLN*. NEB. On account of the great number of trees that may be classed as forest trees and the great number of diseases that these are sub - ject to. it is only possible to take up a few of the most common aiud dangerous diseases of our most important trees. Some of the diseases are common to many different trees. The most dangerous ones are caused by shelf or bracket fungi, or fungi of the toadstool type. Most of these fungi gain admission to the living parts of the tree through wounds, but there are a few species which do not. In the latter the threads spread beneath the ground. They come in contact with a tree root and enter through cells which they have killed by ferment, a solu tion which they have secreted. The fungus threads then up and down in the wood. The fungi which gain their en - trance through wounds are facultative parasites, that is, para sites that start their growth in dead material. Wounds are formed at places on the surface of the tree by the breaking off of </seg>
            <seg id="p092">93 limbs, by pruning, or in MOM other manner. A certain amount of dead tissue results from the injury. ISacteria entering the wound help the decay of the dead tissue. Spores of the t then find their way into the wound. This decayed tissue fi a very good soil for the germination of the spores. The fui threads develop in the dead tissue hut they do not confine them - selves to it. They pass into the live tissue, killing the eel they go. After the threads have reached a certain development, they form the fruiting bodies. These are commonly known as tcadstools. punk fungi, and bracket fungi. The (Hseasi by these fungi is the killing of the tissue of the tree and the decay of the wood. Most of the fungi attack the heart wood. The threads pass inward through the sapwood but they have no i uj»od it. Hut the heartwood is destroyed or decomposed in such a way that it is worthless for all pvrpoi These fungi do not all have the same effect upon the w ■ In their action, some of them extract the material which binds the wood fibres together leaving them as shilling, white eelli fibre*; while others act on the cellulose alone, leaving the « brownish or blackish and of a charcoal consistency. The fu (breads may Ik' in the tree for years before the fruiting 1&gt;. are formed. The tree may live on for years while these thn are working up and down in the wood causing the decay. I'.ut there comes a time when the tree becomes so weakened that it is blown over by the wind. or. as is often the case, dies standing in its natural position. The d\- msed by these fungi are not so very prevalent or dangerous in Nebraska. In the first place, the climate is dry. a condition very disadvantageous to fungi growth. Then, this is not a forested country. What trees we have are scattered or are in small groves. There is not the chance for the spreading of the disease. Then, most of the trees in Nebraska are rang and small. In its youth a tree is very vigorous in its growth. if a wound is formed, it will in a short time heal over. Rut - trouble is occasioned by these diseases and it will lie well to name some of the trees and some of their diseSJ </seg>
            <seg id="p093">94 Thecatalpa is one of the best trees of Nebraska. Two diseases of this have been described by von Schrenk. One is the soft rot caused by the fungus. Polyponix rerxirolor. The fruiting bodies of this are small and numerous placed one above another. The Wood of the tree Incomes pale and reddish, specked with scattered white spots. The discolored wood gradually decays until it be - comes straw colored. At this stage it is very soft and brittle, too much so to be planed. In the final stage, the whole heart - wood becomes a soft rotted mass. This is soft and spongy but will not crumble. The disease is rapid in its development, the tree sometimes Incoming decayed in six or seven years. In the brown rot the wood become* brown, brittle, and full of •racks. The decay takes place near the ground never higher than ten feet, and continuing after the tree has fallen. The rotted wood crumbles easily and when wet cuts like cheese. The fruiting bodies of the fungus, called by von Schrenk PolpporiU cut a I pa; are closely pressed Hat sheets, variable in shape, and in color, white, yellow, and brown at different stages. This dis - is found only locally and is not as dangerous as the soft rot. Whether these two diseases occur in Nebraska. I cannot say. but probably they do. They are both found in Kansas in the large plantations there, and in other places where the catalpa is grown. The cottonwood. another one of our important trees, is at - tacked by a nmnlM'r of these large fungi. A fruiting body of Foincx npphtnutus noticed, had an outward extension of about hfteen inches and a width of eighteen inches. A dead standing tree which I examined recently had as many as ten or a dozen of these large fruiting liodies extending from it. Whether these had caused the death of the tree or were merely saprophytes working on the dead wood. I cannot say. In either case they were render - ing the wood untit for any use. The wood in that tree was yellow with many white specks and of a very spongy nature. The conifers are also subject to a number of diseases. The ■ •nee of these can l&gt;e detected by resin knots forming on the exterior of the tree. The resin passes outward before the in - vading fungus threads, and Iteing under pressure, seeks outlets </seg>
            <seg id="p094">95 at any place. The fruiting bodies of the faagm generally form at these places. Tlic resin hardens* as the twpCBliJM erapon preventing the w(»un&lt;l from healing. Tlie re&lt;l cedar iH attn by two fungi, but seldom Itefore it has reached an age of from fifty to seventy-five years. The white rot. caused by Polyp juniperux. does not occur in this state, it being found in Ken - tucky and Tennessee. The red r» &lt;1 by Poli/poni* mrnetu, is more common and more widely distributed. The wood aff« is full of brown pockets, tilled with disintegrated wood in small cubes adhering to the walls of the pockets. The pockets occur one above the other near the base of the tree. They often unite forming larger pockets. The wood is very brittle. I cannot say whether this occurs in Nebraska. The pines, spruces, larches, and other conifers, as a rule, have like diseases. These are causal by a numt&gt;er of different fungi. The appearance of the wood varies with the different fungi. It generally turns a shade of brown, or red. or yellow. In some it is specked with light colored spots, in others it is filled with numerous fissures. Some fungi attack the roc i, otherH the stems and brand Our other trees, as oaks, ashes, elms, maples, and others, are attacked likewise by many of the large fungi, the trees being killed and the wood rendered useless. The threads of a few of these fungi, attacking l&gt;oth conifers and broadleafed trees, spread through the ground and enter the roots at any point, not needing the help of a wound. One of these is the toadstool. Agaricus tin md another Po/;//&lt;- Kchirrinitzii. has an umbrella shajK'd fruiting body. These dis - eases may 1h' kept from spreading by digging a small trench around the diseased trees. As for remedies, there are none for the diseases caused by any of the large fungi. But they can be prevented in a way. if the time can be afforded. All dead branches should be removed and the wounds covered with tar or something of that nature to prevent the entrance of spores. Tf any pruning is to lte done, the branches should be cut close to the trunk, in late winter if possible, and the wounds coated. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">96 i lie (lis&lt;';is»'(l trees should lx* cut and burned, for they sire doomed iuiyway. Other diseased sometimes occur in forest trees, but they are not as dangerous :is the ones mentioned. The so-called cedar apples of the red cedar is as dangerous a one as any. This disease used by the same fungus that causes rust on apple and pear leaves. The fungus causes an abnormal growth j n the young branches of the cedar. The branch affected is pushed aside until the knot seems to be terminal. About the first of May little yel - low, cylindrical masses push through the surface of the knot. These bear the spores which cause the apple rust. Later the knots dry up and fall off. The influence on the cedar is not marked. A few branches are deformed, but unless the knots are very numerous, there is but little danger. The disease is present in Nebraska, but has seldom caused much trouble. If apples and cedars are close together, there is a chance of the disease becoming too severe. Tf so. either the apples or cedars must be it-moved. While the trees have l&gt;een known to l&gt;ecome infected at a distance of eight miles, the disease will not become serious, unless the two kinds of trees are quite close together. Then as in fruit trees, the leaves of forest trees are affected with such diseases as leaf blight and rust. In some parts of the country these diseases are quite important. Sometimes the trees are almost defoliated. But in Nebraska they cause but little damage. The rust on the cottonwoods and poplars is as bad as any. The leaves affected turn yellow and fall to the ground. The effect of this is to cause a weakening of the tree and growth. Another class of diseases it that known as "witch brooms." These are common on such trees as the hackl&gt;erry and elms, es - pecially the hackberry. These abnormal growths are either caused by insects or fungi. The insect or fungus enters the bud of the twig and sets up a stimulation which causes the bud to send out many small twigs in place of the one large one. These live for some time but thev eventuallv die. These give the tree a very bad external appearance, besides weakening it. </seg>
            <seg id="p096">97 While the diseases that have been mentioned bn only a few i&gt;f the many that trees are subject to. they are the most dangerous ones and the ones to be most feared in Nebraska. Dr. Bessey — I would like 1o say a word here. When you go into the forest and cut a tree and find it rotten on the inside, re - member that there you have a disease. Mr. Kdgerton expects to be a forester, and if any of you find any such diseased sections, we wish you would send them to us. Now do not send any bugs. [Laughter.] I hate the abominable things. Send them to Professor Brunei 1 , he can look after those things. Send me only Ihe diseased sections of wood, and I will see that they go where they will do some good. Professor Bhbloom — Dariag the summer my attention was called to the disease of red cedars. I think from what I learned that this disease was quite destructive, especially among young red cedars. They -were so badly affected that the tops of the little plants had turned almost white. Dr. Bessey — To keep the disease from spreading, we ought to get rid of these dead branch' Mr. Yager — This disease was quite general on the red cedars of the Platte river this year. We find that these cedars that hav l&gt;een planted close to apple orchards, have produced cedar apples and a great many of the orchard trees have blighted. I woulc like to hear some discussion on this subject. This disease is some - thing of which we know very little. Professor Sheldon — There is no question but what the rust from the cedars goes to the apple tr&lt; Mr. Harrison — This fungus of the red cedar has been affecting them for a good many years, and it is a question whether we had ln-tter plant them any more. Mr. Swan — Have you professors discovered anything that will destroy the rust of the apple? Professor Sheldon — Cut all of the red cedars down. Mr. Swan — Is that the only remedy you have? Professor Sheldon — I do not know of anything else. </seg>
            <seg id="p097">98 Mr. Ei&gt;wabi&gt;s (Iowa) — Twenty-three or twenty-four years ago. I made up my mind to have MM evergreens around my orchard. Among the different kinds, I planted about fifty red cedars — Iowa red cedars. These trees were only some four or five feet high, when I began to notice this injurious disease on them. These trees have been there now over twenty years. Some of them have died — it was during the drought of 1890 — and I have noticed for the last ten or twelve years very little of this trouble. With us the red cedar is coming into favor. People regard it as one of the best things to plant. I do not like to think we have to destroy it. 80 far as my red cedars are concerned, I am going to leave them. I want to add a good word for the Austrian pine. It is one of the best things that I have. In 1804. I believe it was. my Scotch pine were almost demoralized, but the Austrian pine came out in the spring magnificently. L. A. Reltzer — I feel like I was losing one of my best friends when we talk of cutting down the red cedar. I have had a great deal of experience in evergreens and cedars. For a while I was discouraged with everything but the Austrian pine. Then I fell back on the native cedar of Nebraska, and it is just the tree T like and admire. Me. Pollard — I would like to say a word relating to this. We have the red cedars at home, and have a cherry orchard just across from them, and the rust has almost ruined the cherries. It is a very serious question with us. We do not want to cut down our red cedars nor our fruit trees. We don't want to use the axe. We want to use our scientific men. and get them to help us get rid of our difficulty. </seg>

Herewith I hand you for your annual report a paper on twenty - five of our common Nebraska birds and what they eat. This is to take the place of the two papers read before the society at its last summer meeting held at Tecuinseh, and the winter meeting held here in Lincoln. After considering the matter carefully, it was thought best to make this modification in order to give specific information about certain of our birds rather than a repetition of the geMMl remarks that have so frequently been published in other places heretofore. The accounts of the birds here treated have for the most part been prepared by Myron II. Swenk, a special student of mine, who pays particular attention to our birds. The percen given of the various kinds of food eaten by the birds treated are chiefly those published in the reports of the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture. In most cases the exact references are given, but in a few where this was impracticable this has not been done. Lawrence Brlner, Speeiml Committee on Ornithology. </seg>

Grasshoppers (10^) are most frequently eaten in August, when they become one-third of that month's food. Caterpillars amount to 6$, all injurious, and at least one-half of them cut-worms.

Hut let him not forget that at every other season this is a well behaved bird that lives to the ad - vantage of all small crops, that it has really paid a good high price for the fruit by insect destruction and that perhaps even cultivated fruits do not grow for man alone. At the same time he should make an effort to reduce the loss to the lowest possible amount. Keep the birds shy by the use of scarecrows or gun- </seg>

These precautions taken, the depredations will to a great extent cease, and recourse to the loaded shotgun as a protection will be a thing of the past. The fact is the Robin is entirely too attractive and valuable a bird to be condemned for such a tem - porary fall from grace. THE BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEE OR TITMOl (Partis atrirapiUus and P. a. septmtrion One of our most hardy, and. at the same time, useful resident birds here in Nebraska is the Black-capped Chickadee or Tit - mouse which is shown herewith in a characteristic attitude so frequently assumed by it while engaged in its search for food. This interesting little bird is grayish above, white beneath, with buffy sides, and has its throat and top of head black. The Chickadee may be seen and heard on almost every warm day throughout winter if we care to go to the groves of natural timber growing along our streams. Sometimes it will even ven - ture into our orchards and about the li here it conn bright sunny mornings for any scraps of food that may be left lying about loose.

The nest, which is made of bark fibres. feathers, moss, etc., is generally lined with rabbit hair. In this are laid from five to eight white eggs that are finely speckled with reddish brown. The young birds are comical looking fellows when first leaving the nest, and may sometimes be seen all perched in a row on a small limb. It feeds preferably upon various small insects and their eggs which are to be found hidden away in crevices of rough bark and about the twigs and buds of trees.

"The hairy skins of the fruit of the common wild sumachs were among the most abundant elements of the vegetable food present. The edible portion of these fruits is evidently eaten to a con - siderable extent throughout the winter. ■A remarkable example of the benefit that may be derived from the presence of a Hock of Chickadee*, has been recorded by Mr. E. II. Forbush. in a bulletin of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture. In a certain orchard in Massachusetts, canker - worms had been abundant the previous season, and the moths of the Fall Canker- worm had deposited great numbers of eggs upon the trees. Pieces of meat. bone, or suet were fastened to the trees early in the winter, to attract the Chick adees. The birds came, and remained about the orchard nearly all winter. They were carefully watched, it being found that they were feeding on the eggs of the (anker-moth. A few birds were killed, to determine the number of eggs eaten. Between L'lMi and 300 canker worm eggs were found in the stomach of each of these birds. In the spring, the female moths of the Spring Canker-worm were also devoured by these birds. The result was that the Chickadt ted in spring and early sum - mer by various other birds, saved the orchard from any serious injury by canker-worms. "The investigations show that the Chickadee is one of the best of the farmer's friends, working throughout the winter to subdue the insect enemies of the farm, orchard and garden. For the efficient service thus rendered the bird asks no pay. although it may be induced to remain more of the time upon the farm prem - ises, if bones or suet are hung in trees where the birds may get it during winter."

It usually nests on the ground in some exposed situation as on prairies or pastures, but it does not shun cornfields or clover fields, or even the potato fields about our homes. There, in a hollow under some protecting tuft of grass it builds a nest lined with horsehair, and lays four or five eggs, white with the faintest tinge of blue, marked thickly with scrawled, zigzag lines of blackish.

Vegetable matter constitutes nearly three-fourths (73#) of its food for the year, and of this 21# is of grass seed, mostly pigeon-grass, crab-grass and other closely related grasses. Grain ( i. e. corn, wheat and oats) forms an unusually large part (13;*) of the year's food, but the greater part of this is taken in the winter months, when the bird is without the limits of our state, and the grain consumed must be almost entirely waste. In Jan - uary it amounts to 490 of that month's food, and in February Little or no grain is eaten during the sowing season, and this acquits the bird of harming newly sown grain, and its love of the roadside renders it quite probable that the greater part of the summer's grain also is waste. It has a great fondness for the seeds of clover and alfalfa, these seeds amounting to 8^, but this is also a winter habit, and comparatively little indulged in sum - mer. The remaining 31 ', is entirely of weed weds, of which half is composed of rag-, bind-, smart-, and knot-weeds, the other half of sunflower and purslane seeds with a sprinkling of amaranth, woodsorrel and lamb's -quarters. The animal matter (2~&lt;&amp;) is en - tirely of insects, of which 14V. or more than half of the animal food, is grasshoppers. These insects are mostly eaten in June when the young birds are being reared, and amount to 43# of that month's food. This places the Lark Sparrow in a high rank as a grasshopj&gt;er check, especially since a large part of the grasshop - pers are the Rocky Mountain locust.

During the nesting season the Goldfinch sings a great deal, for he has a pleasing song of great sweetness and variety, and some - what similar to that of the caged canary, and this together with his similar plumage has given him the popular name of "Wild Canary." He is also called "Yellow-bird" because of his color, and "Thistle-bird" because of his food habits, since he subsists almost entirely upon weed seeds, among which those of the Compositae or sunflower family predominate. Thistles of all kinds — Canada. Scotch, bull thistles — have an especial attraction for them, and there is hardly a greater devourer of sunflower seeds than this bird. The seeds of wild lettuce, dandelion, coneflowers and rag - weed are also eaten in enormous quantities. We certainly have the Goldfinch to thank for this great assistance in checking such troublesome weeds, especially since the great benefit is not in the least offset by some objectionable feature in its diet. THE BRONZED GRAGKLE. (Quiscalus qui8eula aeneus.) The Bronzed Grackle, or large Crow blackbird, is a very com mon bird over the greater part of our state. Hence we should know more about its habits than we do now. Like several of the other birds pictured in this article, it is becoming adjusted grad - ually to the changed conditions which civilization has wrought in the region frequented by it. On account of this adaptability it is sure to become more and more closely related to the agricultural and horticultural interests of the country with each succeeding year. In appearance this bird is that of a very small long-tailed crow or a large blackbird. As the name implies, the feathers of the male have a brassy or bronzed reflection in addition to the purplish tinge possessed by its black feathers. Its eyes are light yellow, and the feet and bill black. The female is more modestly attired than her mate, being of a nearly plain dull black color, though in some cases showing tinges of the purplish and bronzy sheen. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">131 Like several of the other blackbirds this one is quite sociable, and gathers into flocks even during the breeding season. Some - times several dozen pairs will be found nesting in close proximity. They usually build in rather tall trees. &lt; ottonwood groves on farms and even about towus and cities are greatly in favor for this purpose. During the breeding season these birds exhibit some very interesting habits. One of these is the selection of some particular grove where they gather for roosting — sometimes these "rookeries" are used by thousands of birds nightly ; and the same grove is occupied for the purpose year after year. The principal offense with which the Grackle is charged is of damaging grain, and especially corn, both when sprouting and BRONZED GRACKLE. F. E. L.

Other insects such as bugs, ants. etc.. together form 2.:5V. Spiders and their eggs with a few thousandleu are eaten in small numbers throughout the year, the maximum of 7$ occurring in May. Crus - taceans and mollunks are also considerably eaten and average 3.1# of the year's food. This accounts for the Grackle's common occurrence on the banks of streams, along which it walks witli the ease of a sandpiper. Crayfish form the bulk, along with a few sowbugs, snails and small inollusks.

Out of all the 2,346 stomachs only one contained a trace of young birds, and 37 of bird's eggs, so the damage done in this line is certainly not very great. The vegetable element (&lt;i9.7#) is as varied as the animal, and mostly grain and fruit. Grain constitutes 46^# of the food, corn being the favorite and constituting 37.20. This is eaten at all seasons, though mostly in winter, and varies from 82# in Febru - ary to 7.7^ in July. There is very little evidence against the </seg>

From this time on until the corn is gathered, the major portion is gathered from the standing grain and the damage done is often very great. Wheat (4.8#) forms 260 of the food of July and August, or during wheat harvest, but is very little eaten at other times. Oats i re eaten the entire year to a small extent, reaching the maximum of 14£# in April, and while most of the grain is waste, during this month it is probably largely pi up from newly sown fields. Buckwheat, rye and rice together form 1 .*&gt;',. but the latter two are rarely eaten. Weed seeds (4.2j&lt;) are considerably eaten in early spring, fall and winter, reaching a maximum of 11£ in September and October and forming 10.6jf of March's food, but almost entirely absent in summer. They include seeds of rag- weed, barn-grass, gromwell, smart-weed, poke - weed and sorrel. Fruit (o#) both wild and cultivated is eaten to a small extent most of the year, but only in June, July and Au - gust does it become important, forming in these months 7.13# and 10# of the food, respectively. The cultivated portion (2.9%) i* mostly blackberries and raspberries, with cherries, grapes, ap - ples, strawberries, currants and grapes. Wild varieties (2.1^) were principally dogwood, huckleberries, elderberries, service berries and hacklK»rries. The remaining 14# consists of mast (i. e. chestnuts, acorns, etc.) which is taken mostly in fall and winter, sumac, and poison ivy seeds. Numerous pieces of sand, cinders and other hard substances are also present. In summing up the good and bad in this bird the following con - clusion is reached : "'The farmer whose grain is damaged, if not wholly ruined, by these birds, may attempt to count his loss in dollars and cents, but the good services rendered by the same birds earlier in the season cannot be estimated with sufficient precision for entry on the credit side of the ledger. And although </seg>
            <seg id="p131">134 the number of useful predacious beetles they destroy is rather large, yet it must be considered that the final value of useful birds depends not so much on the character of the insects they destroy as on the extent of their work in keeping the great tide of insect life down to a proper level. The examination of the food of the blackbirds has shown that they do a good share of this work, and are therefore most emphatically useful birds- — so useful that no general war of extermination should be waged against them. This does not mean that they do no harm, or that they should be per - mitted to do harm without restraint. A bird whose diet contains 46.5$ of grain must be capable of considerable damage in any section of country where grain is an important crop; and when blackbirds descend upon a corn or wheat field in flocks of hund - reds or thousands, they inflict a real loss, from which the farmer should defend himself by any practicable means. * * * The local ravages they commit are usually due to overcrowding in a restricted area, and when this occurs there is no doubt that their numbers should be reduced." THE REDWINGED BLACKBIRD. (Agelaius phoenucun and A. p. fortis.) Along in the first days of March the Redwings reappear amon us, the uniformed flocks moving about over the barren fields wi1 a military precision, flashing their brilliant scarlet epaulets a every wing stroke, and making a most welcome sight indeed. In few days the plainly streaked females also arrive, and the tw sexes linger about in small flocks in their breeding grounds of th past year, patiently awaiting the growth of new grass and rushes in which to build their nest. This is completed about the midd of June, and is a coarse basket of grass and weed stalks with lining of grasses of a finer texture. The eggs are four or fiv bluish-white with a number of peculiar blackish scrawl scratches, streaks and spots. The Redwing is a polygamist, am often a colony will consist of but one male with several females and nests. However the bird much prefers to gather in minions </seg>

If any disturbance arises the song quickly changes to a harsh "chut," and with fluttering wings the birds hover over the intruding object. After the breeding season is over they gather in large flocks, either alone or with some related species, and late in October they leave again for the south.

Caterpillars (5.9#), including some army- worms, are taken in gradually increasing amounts until in May they form 20^ of the food; in the summer they are but sparingly eaten but increase again to 9|# in September.

Spiders and thousandlegs amount to 1.3#, while snails and various small crustaceans constitute the remaining \$.

Grain (13.9#) consists of oats, corn, wheat and barley. Oats (6.3#) are most eaten, and a large part of the April oats (6£) are no doubt taken from the newly sown fields, while that in July and August (22.6^ and 27.3#) is probably largely gathered from the newly cut grain.

"In summing up the economic status of the Redwing the prin - cipal point to attract attention is the small percentage of grain in the year's food, seemingly so much at variance with the com - plaints of the bird's destructive habits. Judged from the con - tents of the stomach alone, the Redwing is most decidedly a useful bird. The service rendered by the destruction of noxious insects and weed seeds far outweighs the damage due to its con - sumption of grain. The destruction that it sometimes causes must be attributed entirely to its too great abundance in some localities."

This is a hollow in the ground, either natural or made by le birds, lined with fine grasses and placed under some pro - ruding grass tuft which is often lx&gt;nt over the nest to form a sort of a domed roof. The eggs are four to six in number, pure hite, more or less thickly spotted all over with shades of red nd brown. They are terrestrial birds, and only occasionally ill they alight in a tree, always preferring a post or telegraph K&gt;le for an elevated perch. On the ground they walk about with |&gt;eculiar, dainty step, and have a habit of frequently jerking heir tail nervously. Before Hying they crouch low, giving a pring as they start. Their flight is swift and straight, alter - ately beatiug rapidly with their wings and then sailing for a hort distance. Besides trying to prevent the destruction of birds because they are birds, the National Committee of Audul&gt;on Societies has begun the publication of "educational leaflets" in which the economic value of these creatures are set forth. In leaflet No. 3, Mr. William Dutcher has the following to say with reference to the bird under consideration: "It is probable that there are few birds as valuable to the farmer as the meadowlark. as it is entirely terrestrial in its habits, procuring almost its entire food supply from insect life harmful to meadows and prairie lands. "An analysis of the food of the meadowlark leads one to wonder how a farmer can act so much against his own interests as to allow one of these birds to be shot on his premises which he controls. • • • "The accompanying diagram shows that nearly three-quarters of the meadowlark's food for the year is composed of inst 12# is weed seeds, and l.V; is grain.

After the month of May when grain is ripening and is being harvested none is eaten by meadowlarks. The favorite food is insects when thev can l&gt;e obtained; for six months of the year the amount being over 90^ and during August and SeptemlHT over !t!K. Kven during the winter months when insect life is dormant the meadowlark finds enough that is hidden below the surface of the ground or secreted among the grass to furnish a very considerable portion of its diet. An examination of the table* showing the actual kind of food found in the 238 stomachs gives further proof of the immense economic value of the meadowlark. Onwhoppm and crickets compose over of its food, while an equally large share is made up of beetles, among them weevils, curculio, click-beetles, these latter during the larval stage being known as wirewornis, when they often destroy seed before it has germinated, thus ruining fields of corn and other grain at the outset. Meadowlarks also destroy cut worms, army worms and many of the pest known as chinch -bu»s. This latter pest has destroyed in the United States during the l;ist half century grain to the value of over f330,000,000. In some of the Southern states, notably in Georgia, the meadowlark is called the wheatbird, as it is claimed it destroys wheat; however, the scientific study of its food proves this to be an unfounded and erroneous claim.

Till] KINGBIRD. (Tyrannus tyrannus.) Here is a well named little monarch who has gained such a wide - spread reputation for genuine reckless bravery that even the most renowned warriers well may envy him. All trespassers on his domain suffer alike the penalty of his wrath, for there can be no crow so large or no hawk so savage as to inspire fear within him. Hut like all others truly courageous, he carefully distinguishes friend from foe and the smaller inoffensive birds are not molested but allowed to share the same tree with him when they build their nest, and he takes upon himself the additional duty of protecting their property also from the thieving crows and jays. He is a king for justice and right, so long may he reign ! In his personal appearance the Kingbird is quite modest, with his blackish back, head and wings, white under parts, and pure black broadly white-tipped tail. But occasionally when he is ex - cited and raises his short crest, he will show a bright red spot on the crown which is ordinarily concealed. Kingbirds arrive from the south the last week in April, but it is not until June that nesting is commenced, and then the pair selects a fork on a low, spreading limb and together they build a strong nest of small twigs, grasses and hair. The eggs are four in number, white, variously spotted with brown of different shades. Although the Kingbird is no songster he is very noisy, es - {K'cially in the early spring, and he keeps up a constant, shrill twitter, accompanied by much fluttering and hovering in the air. </seg>

"The body of the night-hawk is much smaller than one would suppose from seeing the bird upon the wing. The long wings and loose, fluffy feathers tend to give an exaggerated appeanui' size that is not real. The body is actually so small, and with so little flesh on the loose skeleton, that it is about the last bird one would suppose that anyone would kill for food. The pectoral muscles which move the long wings constitute the principal only part where there is much flesh. The legs are small and weak and do not appear to have much use. so that the liin - which move them are reduced to a minimum. "In one point, however, the Night hawk's anatomy is fully dc veloped : its stomach is huge for so small a bird. In capacity it fully equals, if it does not exceed, that of the common pig whose body is at least twice as large. It is right here that the Night-hawk'a usefulness appears.

Practically all the food is insects of various kinds. Caterpillars - form nearly one-half of the entire food, constituting M0 of the May food and 75^ of that for September.

Other cater pillars prominent in the food were the larva of the Tussock moth, of the sphinx or "hawkmoths," and the various large silkworms, among which the thickly spine-covered Io moth larva was moat conspicuous. As before stated, cuckoos differ from all other birds in that hairy and spiny caterpillars are much more eaten than smooth ones, and the effect of this habit is that often the bird's stomach is so jterforated by the bristles that it has a coating much resembling fur. The larvae of butterflies are much less eaten than those of moths, and adult Lepidoptera are only rarely taken.

It is of a very unoffending nature, and very frequently the nests of smaller birds are within a few feet of its own.

During the past few jean the writer has devoted consider; time to the study of insecticides. Much of the work is too tech - nical to be of immediate interest to the practical man. Th&gt; tails of the methods of study and analysis have l&gt;een publ in scientific journals. This paper is intended to convey to the intelligent horticulturist a brief statement of some of td obtained. No attempt has beta made to write a manual of spraying. It is hoped, however, that it will give the orchar of Nebraska some practical information in regard to the com - ]K«sition and character of the insecticides that they are liable to use during the coming season. There is a widespread opinion that this insecticide is commonly adulterated. A bulletin issued some time since by the Oi State Board of Agriculture contains the following: "Paris g is one of our commercial articles which is shamefully adulter • • • So far as we know but two adulterants are used — gypsum and Glauber's wilts. The method generally given for the detection of adulterations is to dissolve a small sample of the Paris green in ammonia. If there is any gypsum it will not dis - solve, but forms a sediment. OkMber*! salts can not be detected by this method, it being equally as soluble as Paris green; but if one has a strong microscope at hand the adulterant granules can 1m&gt; easily detected, they being white, while the pure article is green. Ammonia, however, is generally a good test, gypsum being most commonly used as an adulterant. * * * Paris green being so much adulterated, its use has been pretty much discarded." Bulletin 126 of the California Station gives in its summary: "Paris green as now found on the market is often unsatisfactory, occasionally a bogus article, sometimes adulterated, commonly I'ARIS &lt;!REEX. </seg>

Orchardists in Nebraska report that they have had poor results from spraying with Paris green and thiuk that the green may have l»een adulterated. In view of this uncertainty, it was determined to analy/ many samples of Paris green as could be found in the hands of the dealers or users in the state. No effort was made to ascertain the factories producing these samples. The &lt;iuestion to be an - swered was simply this: "Is Paris green sold in the state in i instances reasonably pure?" Composition and Standard* of Purity. Paris green is also known as Schweinfurt greeu. and Emerald green. It was long used as a pigment before its use as an insec ticide became common. According to Ehrmann and others, pure Paris green is copper areto -arsenite; in 100 parts — oxide of cop - ier. ."$1.2!t: arsenious acid. ~&gt;S. &lt;&gt;."&gt;: acetic acid. 10.06. Wagner states that this formula is only empirical, ltecause a portion of the copper is present as the sultoxide. and a parties of the arsenic as arsenic acid. The statement has Iteen frequently quoted in station bulletins. The writer l&gt;elieves. however, that his experi - ments show that in the samples examined during the present this variation is very slight if it exists at all. and that Ehrmann's formula is essentially correct. Several of the states have now well enforced laws requiring thai Paris green exposed for sale in the state shall contain not less than ."&gt;&lt;&gt; per cent, of arsenions acid. In such earn there is a margin of a little over 8 par cent, ltetween a pure sample and the minimum legal requirement.

Average of all samples: Per cent arsenious acid, ."&gt;7.1 ; {&gt;er cent soluble arsenious oxide. 1.40. All of these samples are of good quality, and, with one or two exceptions, remarkably uniform. The averages agree almost exactly with the calculated percentage composition of a sample of copper aceto arsenite &lt;ou - taining 2.5 per cent, of moisture and foreign substances. Samples of this character have almost nothing to be desired in the wi purity. No evidence, whatever, of the reputed widespread adul - teration of Paris green was discovered in Nebraska. The Action of Water on Paris €h Nearly all authorities state that pure Paris green is insoluble in distilled water, and assume that, in case Paris green gives off arsenic to distilled water, the cause is traceable to free or uncom - bined arsenious acid in the original sample. This assumption is incorrect. Pure Paris green is broken up. to a greater or less extent, by the prolonged action of water, and is resolved into soluble arsenic, soluble tappet, and a residue containing a higher per cent of copper than the original green. Pure Paris green usually consists of well defined microscopic- green balls which resist fairly well the disintegrating action of water. If these balls are broken by grinding, the decomposition is rapid. In this laboratory we have extracted, by means of distilled water alone, 55 per cent, of the total arsenic in a sample that we have i reason to believe was perfectly pure. This sample was, however, finely pulverized. Free arsenious acid is always soluble in water; combined arsenious acid is liable to Ik- rendered soluble by water; soluble arsenic burns foliage. In ordinary spraying operations Paris green, free from incombined arsenious acid, is not deeomp with sufficient rapidity to seriously burn the foliage of most forms of vegetation. The average of only 1.4 per cent, soluble arsenious acid is all that could be desired. In concluding this topic the writer would state that the </seg>

This insecticide is used in Nebraska less frequently than Paris reen. London purple is generally supposed to consist of arsen - e of lime mixed with a small per cent of arsenate of lime and residue of an "aniline dye." According to an investigation just lublished. the greater part of the arsenic is in the form of arsen - te of lime. It has long been known that London purple is pe - uliarly liable to burn foliage and this tendency has been traced o its high per cent of soluble arsenic. Tests made in this labora &gt;ry show that in some samples considerable lime is present in orm of the carbonate. In such cases there is present inert tatter of no value whatever. Since the comjmsition of London »urple varies m greatly, and since the appearance of the article fords no means of judging of its composition, the prospective ■rckMKT can protect himself only by means of a chemical nalysis. The samples of London purple analyzed in Nebraska average 87.26 per cent, arsenious oxide. If Paris green sells for twenty -. London purple ought to sell for thirteen cents in order to give the purchaser as much arsenic for a given amount of money. It is, however, preferred by many horticulturists on a&lt;- - &lt; ount of its remaining more readily in susjK'iision.

The usual precautions to pi-event poisoning should be observed. Especial care should be taken that well-burned and fresh (i. e., not air-slacked) lime be procured. This product would probably be found by the orchardists of Nebraska about one-fourth as ex- I*ensive as Paris green. The well known formula of the late Professor Kedzie, of Michi gM, as given in California bulletin No. 12t&gt;, is as follows: "Boil two pounds of white arsenic with eight pounds of sal soda in two gallons of rain water. Boil these materials together in an iron pot not used for any other purposes; boil them fifteen minutes or until the arsenic dissolves, leaving only a small muddy sedi - ment. Put the solution in a two-gallon jug and label "Poison — Stock Material for Spraying Mixture." The spraying mixture &lt;-au be prepared whenever required in the quantity needed at the time by slacking two pounds of lime, and adding this to forty gallons of water; pour into this a pint of the arsenic stock solu - tion; mix up. stirring thoroughly and the spraying mixture is ready for use. The arsenic in this mixture is equivalent to four ounces of Paris green." k Prepared for spraying in this way. arsenic would cost in Xe - aska, pound for pound, about one -third as much as when pur - ased in the form of Paris green.

Mr. President, and I'eihir Workers: While electricity may have the first place iu modern research, we have a subject that there is at least more enjoyment in, and one that will have a large part in improving the health and happiness of our children. The evolution of the plum, at first thought, would mean the bringing up of the fruit itself from a low to a high standard, as the Riene Claude, the Lombard and later Shippers' Pride from the sloe, or the Burbank from the insipid Japans. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE HOBTICULTCRAL SOCIETY. H. A. Terry, of Crescent, la., has worked on this line using native varieties ouly and has given us the Hawkeye and Hammer, and now conies out with twenty-four especially fine new varieties that, to take his word. "l&gt;eat the world." Luther Burbank works with the Japs until he produces a plum to which he is willing to affix his name and gives it to the world (a success). T. V. Munson and others of Texas. &lt;J. L. Tabor, of Florida, and many others have worked on this line with signal success. But when we of the north, with the Plum Wizard of Nebraska as leader, tried to use the work of these men, we found obstacles in our way that did not confront them. In our climate their trees winter-kill, so our first work is in the tree. With this end in view, Mr. Williams crosses the Burbank with the I&gt;e Soto and gets one tree that has a resemblance to Dc Soto and retains the Burbank fruit. Not being satisfied, he crosses again with I&gt;e Soto and produce* a Jap fruit on a tree apparently true Americana. He also begins with the I^ombard and Hawkeye. and gets a blue plum on what appears to be a pure Americana Tree. He takes the De Soto and by inbreeding and close selection in eight generations eliminates the red and has a plum that will cook yellow like the peach or apricot. Here we have found a method of overcoming the first obstacle, tenderness of the tree. Could we all live in such a climate as Luther Burbank has, w would not be satisfied with navel oranges or silver prunes, but ou motto, like his, would Ik*, "something better." We have now learned how to put his fruit on hardier trees, and even if w fail in this, we may not l&gt;o so far from producing the "somethin better," in our climate as it at first appears. If it is true, as said by Mr. Kerr, of Maryland, "the Wild Goose and Pottawattamie are crowding the Japs in the eastern markets." the day may not be far off when the appetite of our eastern friends may lx&gt; educated up to and their prejudices re - moved from the red plum, so that we will get a demand for our plum that will surprise the most sanguine. The popular appetite being often a matter of fashion, our own views, or at least the way we advertise them, will have a large influence on the fashion. </seg>
            <seg id="p162">165 EVOLUTION OF THE PLUM. Again, when we cross the i'2d parallel of latitude we find an - other obstacle not encountered by either Mr. Williams or Mr. Terry, they have an advantage, though they neither one like it, the non-sprouting root. This root has proved worthless in oar hard dry dimate, and while .Minnesota and the farther north is not bothered so much, we on the l&gt;orderland find a large portion of our trade taken by the wily agent and his plum tree guaran - teed not to sprout. Very many, especially those who want to set the trees and let nature do the rest until picking time, claim the sprout to be an unmitigated nuisance, and I admit we need a little education along this line. Right here we meet one of the knottiest problem* for the plum grower of the northwest, and if you will l&gt;e patient I will give you a few pointers on the subject of roots and sprouts. First, when you want small or no plums, ( ( uit cultivation; second, when you want to get rid of sprouts, plow your plum orchard June 20th.

Mr. Terry has sent all his new plums to Maryland to 1k&gt; worked on peach in hopes of getting them on their own roots. Mr. Williams is trying to do the same thing only in another way. Your own Professor Hartley says that he l&gt;elieves that an own root cherry tree will bear three times as many crops as a grafted one. Professor Waugh, of Vermont, in a late paper says: "I should like to warn every farmer in the state not to put out any more plums until ♦ hey could Ik 1 procured on Americana roots." The native root line moves gradually south. Northeast Iowa Society conies out this year and condemns all non sprouting roots for plum trees. And the sooner the farmers and orchardists demand own root or at least Americana rooted trees, the sooner he will have what plums he wants to eat. </seg>
            <seg id="p163">166 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. THE DISEASES OF THE PEACH, PLUM. AND CHERRY AND THEIR FRUITS. 1IY I". J. PRITCHARD, LINCOLN. In preparing this paper I have attempted to consider only those diseases of the peach, plum, and cherry which, either through tmmapimitmBB or my own observations. I have found to be present in this state. BROWN ROT. Om of the most destructive of these diseases in Nebraska, and one which causes a large loss of fruit annually, is brown rot. This is caused by a little fungus i Munilia fructiycna) , which may attack any part of the host, particularly the fruit, blossoms, pedicels, and adjacent twigs. Where it attacks the fruit, there is first a reddish or yellow spot in which the fungus threads grow. In the fruit's surface the threads produce tufts of ash-gray spores, arranged in concentric circles. This ash gray or blue-gray powder is quite characteristic of the disease. Later the fruit turns brown and rots. It finally dries, shrivels up, and, unless removed, usually hangs on the tree all winter. In the spring, with the return of warmth and moisture, the fungus threads in these dried or mummified fruits revive and produce more spores which in - fect the blossoms, the young leaves, and the twigs. On a single fruit, there are enough sjwres if properly distributed, to infect a large proportion of the crop. These spores frequently enter the fruit through wounds, but Cordley at the Oregon Station found that spores placed on the moist surface of a perfectly sound fruit soon germinated and pushed their germ tubes through the skin, starting the disenv When the blossoms are attached, they turn brown, rot. and remain hanging on the trees three or four weeks. Whenever they touch the neighboring leaves or fruit, they start decay. During hot, wet seasons, it is nearly impossible to control this All measures must be preventive. First remove both fruit and parts of the trees affected and burn them. Allow no infected fruit to hang on the trees during the summer and scatter </seg>

When the flowers are falling, spray with Bordeaux mixture, and again every week or two with ammoniacal carbonate of copper i copper carbonate, 1 oz. ; ammonia, \ to 1 qt. ; water, 9 gal.) until the fruit begins to color. SHOT HOLE Dl- During the past season, the shot-hole disease of the cherry and plum has affected many orchards in Nebraska. It apj&gt;ears as red or rosy spots on the under surface of young leaves. Later these diseased points become brown; the margins turn purple; and a white speck forms in the center. This speck is a spore mass. On these same dead areas, another crop of spores is developed during the winter. A third and last set of spores is formed in the spring. These are long and slender and are produced in little sacs or pustules. They are spores which infect the new lea\ On the plum the dry area shrinks and tears loose from the margins, leaving a small hole about the size of ordinary shot, hence the name shot-hole disease. The fungus may also atack the twigs, fruit, or pedicels. The trouble is more commonly found on young nursery stock, causing defoliation. In this case growth is delayed. On bear - ing trees, however, it reduces the fruit crop since the fruit's nour - ishment depends almost wholly upon the leafs chlorophyll. When shot-hole disease is present, all the fallen leaves about the tree should l»e destroyed. The trees should l&gt;e sprayed with Bordeaux mixture early in the spring and again after the k expand. POWDERY MILDEW. Another disease worthy of mention is powdery mildew. It may affect grown trees and often does at same time they are inf. with the shot-hole fungus, but it more commonly attacks young cherry or apple trees. The disease makes its appearance as small white spots which boon run together forming a felt. On some trees it grows on the upper surface of the leaves; on others, on the lower. Sometimes </seg>
            <seg id="p165">168 NEBl: HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. it eofen both surfaces. The fungus threads send little Backers called haustoria. down into the leaf cells and absort the plant' juices. It thus lives at the excuse of the host for it is unable t manufacture any food for itself. Where the felt is thick, ther are large quantities of white powder. These powder grains ar Bjtores. If they fall uj&gt;on young leaves or tender shoots they gei ininate and grow, forming another mass of felt. Later ver minute black spherical spores are found. They are surrounde&lt; by a thick wall which enables them to withstand the extreme colt of winter. The next spring the covering decays and the spore germinate. Powdery mildew is worse in dry seasons. The dry weather either conduces to its growth or reduces the vitality of the host, v hich enables the fungus to feed upon it more easily. This pest is harmful to mature trees only in so far as it robs them of nourishment, but it defoliates young trees and stunts them. Since the mildew grows upon the surface, it is easily reached by fungicides. Finely powdered sulphur dusted over the diseased parts will kill it. Some spray witli potassium sulphide solution. one-half ounce to a gallon of water. In the spring all the fallen s should be raked together and burned. ( ; OR BLACK SPOT. A frequent trouble of the jn»ach grower in certain localities is black spot or scab. It makes its appearance as small greenish - brown spots on young jteaches. Sometimes the spots coalesce, forming blotches. These infested areas dry. turn black, and. in severe cases, crack open, furnishing an easy ingress for other fruit-destroying fungi and bacteria. Such fruit either rots or forms a corky tissue as a protection. It is all damaged from a loss of growth, the amount depending upon the number and size of the patches. When the fungus ( Cladotporimm curpoithiluin I attacks a young peach, it almost invariably checks iis growth in that part, giving it an ugly, misshapen form. The fungus frequently attacks the twigs and leaves. On the twigs it forms yellowish-brown spots with a dark border. Some times these spots are in dense aggregations completely hiding </seg>

On the leaves it forms spots with more or less perforation somewhat resembling the shot-hole dis- Halsted (New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station report, is!»4. page 329), wr The fungus prefers the por - tions of the leaf lying midway between the main veins and, as these portions Income infested by the fungus, the tissue dries up leaving h iles that are often circular in shaj&gt;e." P.efore applying a remedy, it is well to consider the d bution of the disease. On the fruit the tilaments spread over the affected areas producing dark colored spores on little upright threads. These spores are borne by the wind, birds, and in - to other fruit. The fungus passes the winter on the twigs and produces more spores in the spring. These are the spores which attack the young leaves and the new crop of fruit. As the tirst step in the treatment, destroy all diseased peaches. In severe cases, remove and burn all infested wood in the winter before the development of spring spores. All the leaves ultout the should be raked up and burned, Before the buds swell in the spring, spray with one pound copper sulphate to twenty - live gallons of water. BLACK KNOT. Perhaps the most destructive disease of the plum and cherry in the I'nited States is black knot. While it is not present to any alarming extent in Nebraska, it is. however, a dreaded foe in the where it has ruined hundred* of orchard* Black knot is caused by a fungus ( I'loin Ujhtia morbosa), hich grows within and irritates the tissues of the past sea - rowth causing small swellings to appear in May or June. Fre - nently it spreads over the trunk and branches killing the entire •ee in less than two years. As the swelling i ti • the hark racks open and a soft, s|K&gt;ngy tissue protrudes.

            <seg id="p167">170 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. of two-celled winter spores. These ripen during the winter and are ready for distribution in the spring. When a knot entirely circles a limb, growth beyond is stopped. The enlargement, unless removed, extends downward toward the tree year after year. To eradicate the disease, cut off all infected limbs several inches IkIow the knot and burn them, for spores will mature in knots left lying on the ground and attack other trees. In seven* -. the summer spores should be checked by spraying with Hordeaux mixture. All infected wild plum or cherry trees in the vicinity should also lw removed and destroyed for the disease spreads alike upon either wild or cultivated varietii FUNGI. Another trouble which needs investigation is the death of numerous limbs and frequently whole trees that are thickly studded with the fruits of fungi. Either a shell fungus (thki - eopkpUum mm nt unix) or a prickly fungus (Trpc.r siniioxia) is usually present in such cases. Since they are close relatives of fungi which can feed upon living tissues, it is possible that they are the source of the evil.

I can assure you they will lie appreciated and that no effort will lx&gt; spared to trace any of your fruit ailments to their sources and ascertain what can l&gt;e done for them.

THE MORAL AND HKALTHFl'L HKNKFITS OF FRl'lT riLTIRK. BY ELD. I). NETTI.KTON. PASTOR NEBRASKA SANITARIUM Mr. Pnx'uUnt. Lmdie* ami (initUnnit: I feel myself compli - mented in having the opportunity to speak to a class of people that I believe are deeply interested in the most l&gt;eneticial science of our state; that is. the culture of fruit. I am to speak of the moral and healthful benefits of fruit culture. Our Heavenly Father desires the health and happiness of His people. He says He wishes above all things that they "should prosper and be in health, even as their souls prosper. " In this </seg>
            <seg id="p171">174 we tears that He is just as much interested in our physical and mental as in our spiritual health. Now when the Lord made man and put him on the earth He purposed he should enjoy himself, and as He knew the quality of his food would have much to do with his happiness. He gave him his bill of fare. He said to him. "Of all the trees of the garden thou mayest freely eat"; also. "Hehold. T have given you everv herb lienring seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a fame yielding seed ; to you it shall Ik* for meat." These health and strength giving articles Clod placed there and said he might freely eat of them. As to the tiesli diet, we only have our food second-handed. The animal gets it first from the grains, vegetables, and fruits. Why not eat first class food? The iH'autifnl garden, man's first home, contained no butcher shopR or places for the wiling of dead flesh for man to eat. These places are symliols of pain and death. I believe it is unnatural and out of harmony with Cod's original plan for man to slay in order to eat. The advantages of the fruit diet are numerous. First, it is a germ killer, a disease destroyer, and a medicinal food. All well informed people know that disease comes from germs. Tt has been demonstrated scientifically that it is absolutely impossible for the typhoid fever germ to live in lemon juice. The same can lx&gt; said of other fruits. If jteople would only 1k&gt; sensible and live on a liberal fruit diet, they would find that it would kill these fever germs, also other germs of disease, and there would be less sick and consequently less sorrow. I ltelieve the men who are here to-day that are interested in the culture of fruit are the great benefactors and physician* of the j&gt;eople. I believe if the orchard could be substituted for the slaughter-house and butcher-shop, it would be very much to the health and happiness of the people. Health is happiness. I am sure that in health there is youth and strength, and in a fruit diet there is that which gives health. The moral influences of tree culture are numerous. Our en- </seg>

Man's first employment before he fell into sin was to cultivate and keep the trees and Inui &lt;lod had planted and given to him. and after the fall He sent man forth from the garden to till the ground and to eat his bread by the sweat of his face. There is a refining and moral influence in the society of l&gt;eauti - ful trees and flowers, especially of fruit trees. Their l&gt;eautifiil lilossoms. making the air fragrant with heavenly perfame, their rich glowing fruit in bright dusters beading have a power to soften in man that which is rough and cruel, and encourage him to cultivate and live for that which is kind and gentle. So the fruit trees, vines, and flowers help to make gentle men and lovely women. Children that receive their first impressions-— and lirst impressions are much more lasting than others — in homes sur rounded by hen coops, cattle yards, and pig |&gt;ens. that has listen constantly to the Itellowing of cattle and squealing of pigs. do not have the loving, refining influence that those do that come from sweet, clean homes, surrounded by green grass, sparkling and laughing brooks, and blooming trees, among whose leafy bowers the happy birds build their nests and sing their cheerful songs. And there is no employment so healthful as fruit growing. All men that study the health question admit this truth. The pale cheeked men and women of our cities long for the green fields and happy groves of the country. Many of the great commercial who live in crowded cities, love to think and sing — How dear to the heart are the scenes of my childhood, When fond recollection presents them to view; The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wildwood.

ORCHARD RENOVATION. K. A. EMI What shall 1m- done with unproductive old orchards? This question cannot be answered in a general way; so much depends upon the orchard and the man who owns it. Each orchard is a problem in itself. Some orchards are so badly diseased that the best treatment is a vigorous application of the axe in the hands of the hired man while the owner is away from home. When the main limbs on the southwest side of a tree are dead and the southwest side of the trunk has lost its bark and begun to ii the tree will usually yield a more profitable crop of fuel than of fruit. There are many old onhards in eastern Nebraska, however, which are not badly diseased, but which, from one CMH another, are unproductive. The writer has recently l&gt;een study - ing some old unproductive apple orchards in southeastern Nebraska. The conditions found there are more or less common; hence a discussion of them may be of interest to fruit growers in general. The orchards in question are about twenty years old. The trees were planted and still stand from eighteen feet to twenty feet apart each way. Several large crops of fruit have l&gt;een produced by these trees, but for several years they have yielded almost noth - ing. Considerable fruit sets every year, but by midsummer most of it is on the ground. What remains on the trees until fall is small, knotty, and wormy. The first thing that is thought of in a CM this kind is that some insect or disease is responsible for the </seg>
            <seg id="p177">180 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. trouble. Some of the trees in these orchards are badly diaeaaed, but a considerable number of them are sound. Codling-moth, eurculio. and sometimes scab are present in abundance ami tainly do much damage, but it is very unlikely that they are the main cause of the trouble. On the same farms with the old orchards, and in one case within a few rods of an old orchard where all the fruit drops by midsummer, young trees, just coming into bearing, last year produced a few apples which, although they were attacked and in many cases deformed by codling-moth and eurculio, nevertheless hung on the trees until picking timt and kept well during the winter. Can the ability of one orchard and the inability of another Ik* a matter of age alone? Are we to expect, in other words, that orchards will become unprofitable at the age of eighteen or twenty years? Will it be necessary to set new orchards every fifteen or twenty years? To the writer this does not seem probable. There are orchards in eastern Nebraska that are producing fair crops at over twenty years of age. Trees ought to produce paying crops of fruit as long as they can be kept healthy and vigorous providing they are of the right variety. Is lack of vigor a prime cause of unproductiveness? Where orchards have received no cultivation for years, where the tnta are far apart and trimmed up high so that a thick sod of blue grass has formed under them, and especially where this grass is kept closely pastured, the trees may lack in vigor and the fruit be small, but in other cases, apple trees are making all the growth necessary. The writer has seen orchards in which continued cultivation and rich soil have produced such vigorous growth that the trees have not been as fruitful as they should be. The drought last season has had a tendency to check wood growth and to induce fruitfulness, but in some cases it may still be necessary to seed the orchards to grass for a few years or grow vigorous clover crops in them during late summer and fall to bring the trees into heavier bearing. The soil is naturally rich, as is shown by the luxuriant growth of weeds where occasional trees have \wn removed, and its surface is in fine condition mechanically. The </seg>
            <seg id="p178">181 few weeds which grow in the shade of the trees, fall to the ground and together with the leaves of the trees are forming a inulrh w leaf mold like that in forests. In fact, almost ideal forests have been established in these orchard But the best forest conditions are not ideal orchard conditi The best forest trees are tkoM that have long straight trunk* few branches. Such trees are produced profitably only when grown close together ; their upper branches alone being expos&lt; strong sunlight. The best shaped forest trees, however, rarely yield much seed. To produce seed or fruit in abundance, trees must have broad spreading tops and trees form such tops only when the light reaches all sides of them. Here we have a due to the cause of unproductiveness in the orchards first consul. A* was noted before, the trees are about twenty years old stand eighteen feet to twenty fed apart. The limbs of adjarcnr trees interlock and the lower limbs are shaded by the ones alxne them. The fact that these trees, owing to the ec lishment of natural forest conditions, do not suffer ously from the drought must not make us think that they are not crowding each other seriously. Soni&gt; the lower branches are dead. Some of those that live have made little growth during the past few years. Many others, it is true, are making considerable growth, perhaps • to twelve inches per year; but growth in length alon enough. The twigs are entirely too slender, the fruit spur - too weak to mature fruits that form on them. That lack of light is responsible for this weak, slender growth is well shown by the that in nearly every case where a tree had l&gt;een cut ou' or three years ago adjacent trees have strong twigs on tin toward the vacant space. This indicates that the first remedv t.» be applied to such orchards is thinning. About one-half of the trees should be cut out at once. In fact, they should have removed three or four years ago. Cutting out every alternate row will make it easy to get a team through the orchard, but will admit light on only two sides of the trees. A better plan cut out every alterate tree in all rows, leaving the end tree in one </seg>
            <seg id="p179">182 row, the tree next to the end in the second row, and bo on. This will expose all sides of the trees to light. Of course this method cannot be followed in all cases. Trees that are suffering from crown-gall, root-rot or any equally serious disease should be removed and sound trees left standing without reference to their position in the orchard. After thinning, the next thing that demands attention is pro ing. If the trees have gone unpruned for several years and are fu of sprouts, the natural impulse of the primer, now that lie is rcn vating his orchard in earnest, is to make a clean sweep of ever thing in the way of water sprouts and crowding brandies. Th is the one thing to avoid. It will not only let the sun ban tl limbs which have become tender by excessive shading. l&gt;ut it also apt to induce a growth of wood so vigorous that the pnwe trees may not fruit well, to say nothing of the liability of tl succulent growth to attacks of blight. We should content m selves with removing limbs that are dead or diseased, that ru each other, making bad wounds, or that are so completely shade* that they can never be of any use to the tree. It is better to tak two or three years to get the trees into shape than to prune m all of the undesirable wood at once. After pruning, thick pail or hot coal-tar should be applied to the wounds to keep out fang which would cause decay if they should gain entrance to the wo&lt; of the wounds. All the brush should be gathered and hurne» Nothing is better calculated to protect many insects and dia than piles of decaying brush. When the trees are thinned out, the weeds will grow with great vigor. It will, therefore, be necessary to cultivate the orchard again or to mow the weeds two or three times each season. Culti - vation is to be preferred, because it is one means of keeping the insects and diseases in check. As a final measure, it will undoubtedly be well "o spray for scab, codling-moth, curculio, etc. Spraying without first thinning and pruning would be a waste of material and labor, but after careful attention has been given to improving the trees by thin - ning, pruning, cultivation and the like, much of the injury from </seg>
            <seg id="p180">183 ORCHARD RENOVATION. codling-moth, scab, and possibly from curculio can be prevented by spraying with Bordeaux mixture and some good arsenic poison. Three or four sprayings should be given. The first just as the leaf buds break, the second just before the flower buds open, the third within a week after the flowers fall, and the fourth a we&lt; two later. If, after employing all these means in renovating old orchards. no crop is secured the first year, the owner should not be dis - couraged. Some improvement should be noticeable the first . but a good crop of fruit cannot be expected for two or three j It will take that long probably to get the trees into condition t&lt;&gt; support a good crop. DISCUSSION Professor Emerson — I would just like to add that if any of you have orchards planted thick and think they are not suffering because the trees are making a good growth, take the trouble to go through them carefully and note those places where the trees have been cut out and note the difference. In some orchards near here the difference in the character of the twigs on the side &lt;&gt;f the trees toward the open space was very noticeable ;incl that shows that it is light the trees need. Mr. Marshall — I would like to ask if you advocate thick plant - ing in the first place? Professor Emerson — Well, that might depend a good deal on circumstances. If you depend on thinning it out yourselw will not pay, because when you have a good strong looking tree you hate to cut it out. Of course, if you plant trees that eoaM into bearing quickly and do not live long, it is possible that jam might plant them thicker. Where the trees do not live more than fifteen or sixteen years, as in the far north, you might Jw well plant them close together; but that is not true here if the trees are taken care of. I do not think it is a good plan to plant trees close unless you are sure they will die. Mr. Snodurass — When you get a tree large once and it is a good size and if it is bearing, that one tree will bear more fruit than two little young trees. You cannot afford to destroy th&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p181">184 NEW: HDRTliM I.TIKAI. SOCIETY. orchard and depend on young trees. If I were planting I would not plant as close as most orchards have been planted. I think I would place the apple trees farther apart and then depend on some secondary crop to get returns until the trees come into bearing. Mb. Atkinson — I have noticed red cedar trees that have rust or scab. Will spraying prevent that? Professor Emerson — I don't know. I looked that up hint spring and no one seems to have experimented much with it. I haw never tried. I don't know. That fungus is a sort of rust. It is the same thing that forms those large mushy balls on your eedar trees, those balls about as large as nuts, which, when the moist weather comes in spring, enlarge greatly and become jelly like. That is the same fungus that does this damage. Mr. Marshall — I thought that was scab. Professor Emerson — No ; it is not scab. That lives on the dead apple-tree leaves. But these cedar apples produce yellow rust like spots on the apple leaves. I would like to try some exj&gt;eri - ments with this disease. We have some small trees at the experi - ment station, but they have never shown the rust. PRVXIXli THE ORCHARD. T. B. SNODGRASS, JOHNSON. Mr. President.

I presume that if I should call up a dozen men and line you up here that each and every one of you would have a different way of taking care of your trees. I presume that there is not any one phase of orcharding that is so sadly neglected as that of pruning, and I wish to say. ladies and gentlemen, that if I had not had over </seg>
            <seg id="p182">HARD. 185 fifteen years of actual work in pruning, together with twenty years in orcharding, I should not undertake to say one word in regard to pruning. I wish to say also that unless my tongue slips every proposition that I make you here to-day I can prove right in my own orchard, an orchard that was planted some twenty years ago. The trees were planted exactly two rods apart each way and when the trees were small, crops were planted between them, and since that time it has had thorough cultivation throughout the season as well as in the early part of the year. In the early part of my orcharding I attended a horticultural meeting one day and an old gentleman there, in talking on the subject of pruning, told us young fellows to go to the hardware store and pay a dollar and a quarter for a pruning knife, take it home and let it fall in an old well. You see what that meant. That meant to plant an apple tree and then let it strictly alone. I can show you orchards in our community that have lut'ii let strictly alone and I cannot show you any fruit on them : ami I can show you orchards that have been pruned that today thfl apples are actually breaking the limbs. Now there are so many things to consider on this question that I scarcely know where to commence and the President will tainly have to call me down. In the first place, we deitend on our nurserymen to grow the trees until ready to set out and we expect them to do their bearing after their own fashion: but ;is soon as the tree comes into our possession it is our business to look after the pruning as well as the other care of the tree there - after, and there are about three or four principles in pruning that include the whole business. One of the most common practices throughout our whole country is to allow a tree to fork. We buy a nice little tree and there are two leaders — two limbs contending for the leadership — and it is a beautiful tree and we just have not got the heart to take out our jack knife and cut one of them off and only have one; or if we do not take the limb off entirely, if we would just cut it off at a bud. I have trees in my orchard that are six or eight inches through </seg>
            <seg id="p183">186 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OOIETY. that two limbs were contending for the leadership and only one has been cnt off at a bud, that has a bushel of apples on to-day. The other limb sent out other limbs far enough above this that they did not interfere, and they are loaded. I have had Jrat one tree in twenty years that has ever broken down with me and I have that one on the ground now. One tree broke down just a few days ago and that is the only one I have ever had. I have had cherry trees-, but not apples. There is another principle in pruning that is to be looked after and we find a great deal of it in riding through the country. Last fall my son and I took two loads of apples to Lincoln and on the way I naturally looked at the orchards as I went along and I only saw about three orchards in the entire trip that it seemed to me looked like they had had proper care. Here is one thing that I found was prominent on that trip. T had seen some of it but I did not know It was a general practice. And the nurserymen arc not to blame; it is you. They have to grow all kinds of v The tree that suits one man another won't take, and they have t&lt;&gt; have trees to suit all, but it is your business to see what kind of a tree you get. There is a tree that is very prominent all over, between my place and Lincoln, at least ; and it is forked like i have here. It is what they call a whorl; and that is, where all these limbs have come out near each other, come out pretty together. Here iR a specimen with five limbs coming out within a finger's length. [Showing specimen.] Now we all understand that these limbs never get any farther apart. That tree is no gi &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;]. as it has ruined itself, and the man that bought it and planted it has thrown away his time. That tree will never bear. The main part of the tree has been choked off entirely. Instead of having an apple tree, after a while he will just have a little sprouting bush. It never can be a profitable tree. A portion of the limbs should have been taken off the tree and started out right. Those are two principles included in pruning. Then another very serious objection to the orchards in this day is letting limbs oqm out too near each other on the same side of the tree. It would be much better to take off one of these limbs. You have to be your </seg>
            <seg id="p184">187 PRUNING THE ORCHARD. own judge of which one shall be taken off. One or the other mu$t be taken off. The professor spoke of thinning out the trees and letting in the sunlight and the air to color up the apples — to give them color — and to give them flavor also. The apple that grows in the shade is flavorless. It is not fit to eat. I advocate pruning trees from the time that we plant them out until they are de-ad and gone. When we get the tree home from the nursery then we want to commence, if we have not learned it already, and understand how to prune that tree and take the limbs off each and every year as the professor said. You can't go into an old orchard and do the work all in one day. I have seen that tried right in my own neighborhood. The best thing would have been to cut the tree down entirely. That is too great a shock to the tree. But if we commence with young orchards and cut off the forked limbs, and parallel limbs, and the limbs that grow up in the center and make the tree too thick, that is an easy matter, and when our trees are eighteen to twenty years old we have hardly commenced to think about them dying. One of these advocates of planting trees thick, a man that had had a great deal of experience in orcharding, came into my orchard when the trees were small and two rods apart, and it looked a long ways apart, and he shook his head and he i "Thomas. I am afraid your orchard will never amount to much." That made me heart sick right there, to hear an old man in the business, that had sold a great many bushels of apples, make that remark ; but I went on with the work. When the orchard m years old the same gentleman passed through and the trees were all healthy and he said, "Tom, if there's an orchard in Neinaha county that is going to live and hear to a good old age you have it right here." I felt encouraged. I have some specimens here that I want to show you that prove, so far as I am concerned, that a great many larger limbs tan be cut off with impunity. I have been making this test in my own orchard to prove to myself whether or not I dared do it and so some two years ago and a year ago I took off some large limbs. </seg>
            <seg id="p185">188 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The lower limbs on my orchard now. they have no apples on. They have leaves on and are drawing from the strengt): of the tree and it seems to me like they have got to go, and with the experience that I have had in taking off large limbs in the last two or three years I feel perfectly safe and 1 am going to make the venture. I am going to do it in a small way and take a half off each year so as to give the tree time to recover. I have taken off limbs three inches through. I use no paint. I fail to see the need of it. And I find that the wounds are healing over just as nice as can be. I went out to the orchard and I thought I would bring a specimen of the tree healing over where the limbs had been taken off as large as that but I couldn't find one that 1 had the heart to take out of a nice tree with ten or fifteen bushels on, but I would do it if I thought it would be of any general benefit and if in the future it is necessary I will lose a tree to prove to your minds what can be done. There is more in the manner in the way a limb is taken off than anything else. A few years ago a gentleman in our neighbor - hood advocated the principle of cutting off a limb, leaving a stub about a foot long; next year cut off another little slice and s&lt;&gt; on until you get down to business and take the limb off when' you wanted it off and he claimed that it was less shock to the tree. Well. I had but to think that if I had a dog and wanted to cut off his tail I certainly would not murder the dog in that way. I have quite a lot of specimens here, which, as I suppose, will prove to you that the taking off of larger limbs, if taken in the early season of the year, is not injurious. Now, gentlemen, if you will go to an orchard where a man has used an ax to take off limbs instead of a saw you will find that these limbs are never going to stop dying. They will never heal over. There is no bud out here to pump the moisture out and to heal the limb over, and decay will never stop. We are told that we must not take off limbs even as large as that [showing a limb one and a half inches through], because it causes the tree to take lots of water in. I never could understand </seg>
            <seg id="p186">189 PRUNING THE ORCHARD. how the water got in there. There is scarcely ever a limb that stands right up and we very well know that if we pour water on a tree's surface we can hardly force it into a small hole. There is a time, as I consider it, to take off limbs, unless quite small limbs. I have no hesitancy in cutting off small limbs that I can take off with my knife. I find it safe any time. But I would be very careful as to what season I took off a limb like that. [Showing limb one and a half inches through.] I would not want to take a limb off with the saw until January and if I could do all of my pruning in one day I would do it the first of April, just before the sap starts in the spring, although we have men who advocate pruning every month in the year and especially in June, In every other line of business that farmers undertake they study it from Alpha to Omega, and it always seems strange to me that so important a phase of orcharding as the pruning has been let go in the manner that it has. You can scarcely find a book on the subject. You go all over the country and we have orchards on every farm, but you can scarcely find a book on that subject. Now I will try to show you how I take off a limb of a tree, and I want to say also that one of the practices of my early pruning 1 had to give up. When I first commenced to take off such ii limb as that [showing a limb an inch and a half in diameter] I justified myself in taking it off in the manner that I did with the idea that it was making as small a wound as possible, and that it would heal over very quickly and I cut right square across the limb that I wanted to take off and that made a small wound. The limb was on the tree in a slanting position and by cutting it off right square across the limb it made a smaller wound than if the limb was taken off parallel with the body of the tree or the limb that it grew on. You will find that it will injure your trees less and that your trees will heal over entirely and cap over and do it quicker, if you make a slanting cut. Mr. Marshall wanted me to explain why here is one of these specimens with the heart of the tree to one side of the limb. And </seg>
            <seg id="p187">190 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. that will continue right on, too, in the side of the tree. 1 cannot eay, I don't pretend to know whether the taking off of that limb changed that or not. If anybody does know, I am not from Mis - souri, but pretty close by. It does seem to me like it is a sad mistake to plant trees as ntensely thick as they have been planted right in my own neigh K&gt;rhood. There is only one way out and I have never seen a an get out that way. Plant the trees thick, take good cart' not o pay much attention to pruning, and get three or four good rops of apples ; and then take out every other row entirely ; then n a year or two more go cross- ways and take out every other row ; nd then take them down entirely. But that is a theory I have - ever seen put into practice. It seems to me better to plant the rees farther apart and to prune them carefully and I am satisfied lat it at least does give me good results — good returns — and I can tell you here and now, as I spoke before, you want to do some f this work everv vear. Everv vear some needs to be done. Now then, in an old tree twenty yean old. t ven when they get to be fifteen, you will find a great many limbs standing right straight up on your tree which one day had the finest apples on it. That will be a detriment to the tree and in your way, and ought to be taken out. and, as Professor Emerson says, all the brush ought to be burned. There is one practice, for the benefit of those that have planted the trees too close, — and I wish to say that my trees two rods apart, planted twenty years ago, are interlappiug — where trees have been planted as dose as so many are. here is a practice that helps somewhat. When a limb is growing out straight from the tree after the tree becomes laden once with apples this limb naturally hangs down over to the ground. 1 have served a good many of my trees in this manner: Omk off the limb right at the bud when it is making an upright growth ; and I can show a great many fine apples on limbs that have been treated that way. Another thing, in regard to water sprouts. You take an orchard that is heavy laden with fruit, that weighs down, and the fruit hangs on it and the limbs harden and they are apt to stay </seg>
            <seg id="p188">191 PRUNING THE ORCHARD. that way. I have found I can fill the spare in batwvai that has been left vacant by the limb bending over by these water *p" and I have sprouts in mv orchard to day laden with fruit, that have grown right out and filled that space. I don't know, Mr. President, as I have anything further to say on the subject and T hope that I have not done any harm if I have not done any good. I thank you. SSION. Professor Emerson* — How far apart do you like to have the ground limbs come out when the trees first start, not to have them too close together? About how far do you leave the limbs apart? Mr. Snodgrass — Why. if I get a limb from a fiMit to eigli inches or even further it is close enough. Take two limbs just three inches apart now. and just think what they will be when they get to be six inches through, each of them, and they would get even thicker than that. Professor Emerson — I don't mean on the MM side of the tree. I mean one on one side and the next on the other side. Mr. Snodgrass — Well, you could have two limbs come out &lt;&gt;u opposite sides, you might say. if they come almost together course it would be better if they were an inch or two or three inches above each other than if both come out together. 1 always forms a collar right around the tree. Two limbs would not close that, but three will do it. Mr. Marshall — Isn't it hard to get two opposite to each other on an apple tree? Mr. Snodgrass — Not very. You hardly ever find them that way, though. Professor Emerson — When the limb gets to be three or four inches through they look to be pretty nearly opposite. Mr. Snodgrass — -Yes, the limb never gets any higher on a tree than when it starts. </seg>

Mr. President: It is said that one who is good at making ex cases is good for nothing else. I will run that risk, and make an excuse or apology. I was billed for a ten or fifteen minut talk in the hall with the Horticultural Society in a feeble effor to pay tribute to one of the first men of this state, and hence ha not prepared myself for such an occasion as this, and in a pla&lt; such as the one in which I find myself. In addition to that, have a chronic trouble with my throat and am forbidden by in physician from speaking in the open air, but I will run the ris in that and accept the invitation. It is a great pleasure and an honor I feel for me to say a word in regard to the life and life-work of one of our best and fore - most citizens. I regret that he has passed away; but I rej&gt;v;ir, it is a pleasure to me to speak of him. Julius Sterling Morton was born in the state of Now York seventy years ago the 22d of April last, and there is what might be called a coincidence or something singularly strange in that fact. I have known Mr. Morton for forty-seven years intimately. and I think I knew much of him — much of his thoughts, much of his ideas, much of his habits. I remember that Mr. Morton desired to pass the three score and ten milestone of his life. lie did it just on five days of borrowed time. His birthday was on the 22d of April and he died on the 27th. I say there w;is something singular about that, because of my own knowledge he had long wished to pass that milestone. When young, with his parents he moved into the state • Michigan, where he was well educated in all the practical affair of life; and had qualified himself afterward for the practice o law. Without having much practice he came immediately afte bis marriage to the territory of Nebraska. He soon found tha there was an opening in this new west that suited his tastes an </seg>

His thoughts, his words, his pen, were all directed in the line that tended to make a commonwealth. Is make a happy and prosperous people, and hence, in the language of some one, I cannot now remember, and it is not material, speaking of a man who had made his mark in the world : "If you seek his monument, look around you." That truism never was more applicable to any individual than it was to .J. Sterling Morton. He comprehended first that it was a timberless coun - try; that without timber, without something in that line of work, we should always be restrained in our onward work and progress; and hence he at once directed his attention to what could be done in that line. Not only the forests, but the orchards, more particularly the orchards, but everything of a tree-growing character he devoted himself to. He was the author, as you all know, of Arbor Day. That has become universal in the United States, and in many of the older countries. I was intimately associated with him in that work, and in my official position on the State Board of Agriculture I have had, within the last ten years, some half dozen or more applications asking information in regard to Arbor Day and what was meant by it. from foreign lands. As to his work in tree-growing we have all felt the result of his work and I scarcely need talk to the peo - ple of Nebraska, and especially in this vicinity so near where he grew up, only a few steps from you. so that you nearly all know as much as I can tell you, and hence it seems to be a waste of time to refer to this matter. I liked Mr. Morton, and I will take occasion to relate the cir - cumstances under which we became acquainted. It was simply a fact — there is no- egotism about it. When I came to this state he was editing a Democratic paper in Nebraska City. I came to Brownville the next year after he did and was in the same work, and we differed politically, and without seeing each other, </seg>
            <seg id="p191">194 r,i"iv\^i\ A M A 1 &gt;j It' *1\ III \ (-It KA I ■ \ |j 1 I, t writing about each other and about politics. I reckon there •e no two better scored men in the territory of Nebraska than rton and Furnas. Some of the bitterest, most scathing articles &gt;eared regarding each other and our political courses. It was haps a year afterwards before we met and when we met. our versation was all in a different direction entirely from politics — in regard to everything that tended to make this common - wealth, and we fell in love with each other and agreed never to talk nor write politics again; that is. as to each other. That compact was kept in good faith always, strictly so. and we thus became co-workers outside of politics in a more ennobling lino of work than modern politics. It was a work more en - nobling and tended to make a happier and more prosperous people than modern politics. We followed that line of work in conjunction with each other, and I think we have jointly ac - complished something in that line. I know that Mr. Morton has. I know that his impress was not only in this state, but in all the other states of this Union, and in foreign countries. He was unfortunate in political associations in so far as holding office was concerned. He was a faithful exponent of his own principles. I think a more honest man never lived. He be - '1 strictly in what he said and he had the boldness to speak what he thought. He did not stop to think what the influence would be. He was satisfied he was right and he had the boldness and manhood to speak out on every occasion, and whatever might have been the difference of opinion in regard to Mr. Morton, his political enemies, even, always gave him the credit of being an honest, conscientious man. I differed with him in many things besides politics, but we never discussed those questions about which there was a difference of opinion. After serving here in various capacities, he was. when tp - pointments were made under a Democratic administration. aj&gt; pointed Secretary of the Territory of Nebraska and at one time acting governor, in which capacity he did more than all the territorial governors had ever done before him. He was selected as one of the president's counselors in the </seg>
            <seg id="p192">MEMORIAL ON J. STEELING MORTON. 195 cabinet of President Cleveland; and this uas singular. He was in the national convention when Cleveland was nominated first and his first choice was a gentleman from Delaware. Mr. Bayard. He stood out for his man to the last and never did support Cleve - land in the convention, but Mr. Cleveland was nominated and he said a good many ugly things about him, — bMHM I think he felt it, — and the result was that on one or two occasions, when his friends desired him to occupy some position within the president's power to appoint, he treated him coldly and said he didn't want any Morton in his administration. Durin land's second administration he became one of his cabinet, as the secretary of agriculture. He received that appointment under singular circumstances. I well remember he had some political friends who desired him to have that position. He really had more friends in the republican party who knew his fitness for that position and worked more strongly for him to obtain that position. He finally succeeding in obtaining it ami became really the man of that cabinet. There was more brains there than in any other one man. What he did in the line of agriculture there has served a greater purpose than that done by any of his predecessors. I will not say su because the present one has not completed his term. Mr. Morton did this — and I claim a little of the credit — I visited him at Nebraska City and said to him that if he didn't do anything else during his term than to do away with the spending of millions of dollars in the distribn tion of the commonest garden seeds in this land he would have accomplished his purpose. The distribution of seeds in an early day meant something. There were then no experiment stations in the United States. Not one. We have some of those ; Professor Burnett knows what they are accomplishing, what they have been organized for; but before that Mr. Watts of Pennsylvania was commissioner of agriculture and the law existing then, and the same law exists now, required him to obtain valuable h "New and valuable seeds," I think. Professor Burnett, is the language of that law, sent out for experiment to this man and that man, or that lady, all over the country, with printed instmc- </seg>
            <seg id="p193">196 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. tions, and every person was an experimenter. They were made the experiment persons instead of stations. Now we have these experiment stations all over the land, Kareetj a school in this country without such a station, such as we have in Lincoln and all of the capitals. He was with that work. Those experi - ments were made in our own soil and with all the surround ings necessary to let the ]&gt;eople have the l&gt;euent of that experi - ment. Now then, this simple nonsense of sending out two or three million dollars of seed and the commonest seed that grows in the land, that everybody can get everywhere. — and I have reason to believe when I say this that I state what is a fact, — that the most of the seeds are old Maw worn-out seeds, when they are sent out. I wouldn't plant one of them. The present meml&gt;er of congress sends me seeds every year. I would not risk them under any other circumstances. The law compelled him to send them out, but he procured the very best possible. They were tested, and gave satisfaction. lie went into the cabinet endeavoring to do away with that criminal expenditure of money, because no good had grown out of it. He was determined if they were to be sent out, they should be good, such as he would not be ashamed of. He got himself into a hornet's nest. He told me himself that he got into trouble about some of it, that Mr. Cleveland sent for him to come to his office and Cleveland had a kind of an every day way of talking with everybody and he says. "Here, my young man, ain't you getting yourself into trouble?" "What trouble?" he says. "You don't seem to want to send those seeds out and comply with the law under these circumstances. " Mr. Morton said. "Mr. President, when I came into your cabinet you called a conference and stated to us all that you didn't want any sinecures about any - where in your administration and you didn't want anything done without any practical purpose. I found there is nothing prac - tical in this thing the way it has been conducted and the law is not complied with. These are not new and rare They are old seeds taken from the wholesale dealers and are good for nothing. They have been sent out for two or three years to sell. </seg>
            <seg id="p194">197 MEMORIAL OX J. STERLING MORTON. and then were returned to the houses, and they have this way of getting rid of them." He had learned this out to be true, too. "I am endeavoring to carry out your ideas.'" Mr. Cleveland was rather pleased with his position and said, "You fight it out in your own way." The result was that he obtained good seeds and endeavored to get as many of the new and valuable ones as pos - sible under the law, and I think that the people of the country were better pleased with the seeds sent out by Mr. Morton than by any other. Now I want to read you an appreciation, what the department at Washington thinks, those who were in immediate contact with Mr. Morton in his work, what they had to say of him since his death. This was at a meeting held by the employes and sub - ordinate officers in the agricultural department over which Mr. Wilson, the present secretary, presided, and this is part of the report of a committee: '•The administration of ex-Secretary .T. Sterling Morton, whose death occurred April 27, was marked by a number of important events which contributed in no small degree toward the reor - ganization and development of the department. While nothing like a general reorganization was undertaken, a number of changes were made in the direction of a more compact organiza - tion, and several new lines were inaugurated which materially strengthened the work of the department. The divisions of soils and of agrostology, for example, were established in his tim&gt; was also the dairy division in the bureau of animal industry. Congress appropriated funds for the collection and distribution of information relating to public roads, out of which grew the office of road inquiry ; and the section of foreign markets was re - organized and placed under the secretary's immediate sujKrvision. "Through Secretary Morton's recommendation the experiment stations and the department were brought into much closer rela tions. In his first annual report he called attention to the lack of any federal supervision of the funds given for experiment stations, and advocated an amendment of the law placing such supervision in the hands of the secretary of agriculture. In </seg>
            <seg id="p195">198 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. response to this, congress empowered the Secretary to prescribe the form of the annual financial statements and directed him to ascertain whether the expenditures conformed to the require - ments of the Hatch act, which has taken the form of an annual inspection. The advisability of this step is universally accepted, since, aside from safeguarding the funds, it has brought the department into much closer relations with the stations, and has strengthened the organization of the whole movement. -I'cretary Morton also obtained the first appropriation fo nutrition investigations, which carried the first legislative prov feion for co-operation with the experiment stations, a featur which has since assumed more imj&gt;ortance every year and ha proved of mutual benefit in working out practical problems i the application of science in agriculture. "The Year book, which supersedes the formal annual report and has become one of the foremost agricultural annuals of the world, was started in the second year of Secretary Mortons ad ministration; and he secured the first appropriation from congress for the publication of farmers" bulletins, which he hojM-d to substitute for the congressional seed distribution." And here let me say. that in his attempts to do away with the distribution of worthless seeds he encouraged the policy of dis tributing monthly bulletins of information that were worth thousands more than all the old seeds he had been sending out before. "Failing in this effort and in the attempt to bring about th abolition of seed distribution, he set about improving th quality of the seed furnished, by establishing a lal&gt;oratory fo testing the purity, vitality, and genuineness of the seeds whic were purchased for that purpose. This laboratory has l&gt;een coi tinued and its duties and scope materially enlarged." Upon that very point I could talk to you all this afternoon — - of the importance and power of scientific agriculture. In other words, the farmer who doesn't keep up with the procession, who doesn't keep up with all that is required to obtain the greatest yields with the least expenditure and toil, is out of the </seg>
            <seg id="p196">199 MEMORIAL ON J. STEELING MORTON. race. It requires as much to fit a scientific farmer to prose - cute that vocation in a way that pays as it does to adauite ■ physician or a minister, and unless he does and acts from that standpoint farming: don't pay. But I am digressing. Just another point in regard to expenditures. Mr. Morton was an economical man in all his work and life. He was opposed to the taxation of the people for any other pur - pose than the support of the government, and in that he was correct. There is no kind of doubt about it. that there is no justice in taxation for any other purpose. We have gotten ourselves in the habit all over this new country of taxing ourselves to help build railroads and to help do this and to help do that. Mr. Morton fought all such, I remember, when a member of the legislature; he fought that just as strongly as he ever did afterwards. Be was an economical man throughout. Now in regard to that so far as his acts were concerned while he was secretary of agriculture: "Secretary Morton appreciated the inadequacy of the pr&lt; department quarters and the great desirability of a commodious and appropriate building. In his last annual report he pointed out that over $2,066,000 has been covered back into the treasury during his administration, and strongly recommended that the amount so saved be applied to the erection of an agricultural building. "Mr. Morton's deep interest in tree planting and practical forestry is well known, and he will be remembered especially as the author of Arbor Day legislation. "Upon the receipt of the news of the ex secretary's death a committee was appointed to draw up appropriate resolutions. which were subsequently adopted at a meeting of the officers and employes of the department. Secretary Wilson has directed that a portrait of Mr. Morton be inserted as a frontispiece m the forth - coming Yearbook now in press." Did you ever hear of anybody in public office before who g back money into the treasury after it was placed in their hands for expenditure? I do remember but one instance of it in the </seg>
            <seg id="p197">200 NEBRASKA STATE HOBTICII.TI RAI. BOCIBTY. discharge of official duty in this state. William E. Hill, who was a resident of Nebraska City, was given in charge the erection of an insane asylum at Lincoln with a certain appropriation. Be completed the building according to contract and returned a very handsome sum; not so large as this, but quite a large amount. I speak of these things to show the character of Mr. Morton and I believe that we cannot do any better act than to hold before the young men and the young women what good men have done, what has been accomplished by good men. I do not think yon can do more to educate the young man or woman in a line of duty than to keep before them what such men as J. Sterling Morton have done. It is an object lesson to us, what men have done. I think the longer you can perpetuate the memory of men the better. We have under consideration now the project of erecting a monument to Mr. Morton at Nebraska City. We started with a view of raising twenty-five thousand dollars for that purpose. Somebody said to me. "What do you want to spend money that way for?" I replied, "I wish we could on monument to every man who has done as much as Mr. Morton. It is there — it remains forever." When the youth of coming gen erations look at that monument and say. "What was that erected for?" The answer will be, "It was to commemorate the life of J. Sterling Morton." "Who was J. Sterling Morton?" "One of the very early settlers of Nebraska, who devoted his whole life to the advancement of the state of Nebraska. He was the author of Arbor Day, which was the means of planting millions and mill - ions of trees." "Oh. that is the man, is it?" Now when these monuments are built each leaves its impress and it teaches the young — not only the young but the old — what can be acconi plished by a single person in a single life. Thia morning, when I left home. I thought I would simply i to this audience what J. Sterling Morton said of Dr. J. A. Warder, of Ohio. All of you older men remember him — a man who grew up under the same circumstances as Mr. Morton. He qualified himself for the practice of medicine, but when he got out into the world he thought he saw other fields in which he </seg>
            <seg id="p198">201 could accomplish more. At the meeting of tho Mississippi Valley Horticultural Society Mr. Morton was present. We were to take some action in regard to the death of Dr. Warder. I knew what a pen Mr. Morton wielded, better than a tongue. He was not an orator, but he had on hand always, a stock of anecdotes and inci - dents that he could tell in a plain practical way, but was not a silver-tongued orator. But he was a silver-tongued writer — a mighty pen. He was one of the warmest hearted men I ever knew. I knew him closely for forty-seven years. At first acquaintance he didn't leave that impression. He seemed rather brusk and gruff in his deportment. Be didn't seem to get down on a level with the common people. But he did have the biggest heart in him I ever knew. Somebody said of him once. "He never forgot his friends." I said, "And he never allowed his enemies to forget him." Now that covered the characteristics of -I. Sterling Morton. He Wiis positive. You knew where to find him always. I have known him in some of the affairs of life in dealing with his children — and by the way. I want that to come in. There was never a man who had a more ideal home than J. Sterling Morton. No man who felt more the importance of a home. I have said that a man never becomes a citizen of the country in which he lives until he becomes identified with the soil of his country, and that means to own a home. He had given attention to the home. Let me mention this. He had — he has a home, an ideal one and four ideal boys. Everything about him was ideal. And in order to perpetuate that home, to make it a point where his children and grandchildren, and their children and grandchildren could have a home, Arbor Lodge was conveyed or written up, or whatever my legal friends may call it, in the old English entailment system, from oldest son to oldest son. I was at his funeral and was talk - ing to the boys, and Joy, the oldest one says, "I don't want this property and I won't take it. I differed with father when he made this arrangement and I don't want to take it. It is ours — it belongs to all we boys." He had all his children and grand - children come together at Arbor Lodge once ■ year at least and had sand piles fixed for the little fellows to play in and everything to amuse them. Therefore he was a strong man in that line. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">202 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. Now I will read this reportland I want you to substitute the name of Morton for Warder all the way through. This was his report: "As guests register their names at a hotel, depart and are for - gotten, so humanity, stopping for a short time on earth, makes its autograph upon the age, and sets upon its returnless journey to that realm whence come neither tiding nor greetings. "Each individual of the race leaves some trace of his existence in the generation in which he lives, and numbers transit their names to posterity italicized in good deeds or embalmed in mMc and elevating thougli "The desire to be rememl&gt;ered and esteemed by those who conic after us seems to be, with the better and more exalted minds, a greater inspiration to high intellectual effort than the mere plaudits of contemporaries. As on the stage these actors who play best their parts are recalled and applauded after the curtain has fallen, so those in the brief drama of life who have best performed their duties are, after their mortal costumes have been forever laid away in restful graves, again called out by their admiring contemporaries and thus their intellectual and moral BCMMfr alities reappear before the lights, amidst tumultous and emulative applause. "It is the duty and pleasure of your committee, gentlemen of the Mississippi Valley Horticultural Society, in harmony with this line of reflection, to bring before you the character and services of the recently deceased Dr. John A. Warder, of Ohio. His naturally strong mental faculties were led out and trained in school and college to a full and vigorous stature. His chosen pro - fession of medicine, in the earlier years of his manhood, occupied his entire thought and stimulated him to untiring labor of mind and body, and at the same time gave him that culture of the heart which, through his refined, emotional nature, was ever incarnat ing itself in delicate acts of kindness and generosity toward those who needed the sympathy of friends. "But he turned at last from his professional studies — from the books in his library — to those broader investigations of the </seg>

His childhood and youth had passed amidst the rust of a home in the country, on a farm ; and as the m shell, though ever so long and far away from its home in the surf. will, when placed to the ear always moan of its ocean home, so his great and tender soul ever yearned for a life among the flora and sylvia of youth. His brave and benignant spirit explored all avenu&gt; knowledge which led into flowering fields and orchards. To his eye every blossom was a poem; to his quick j»erception every tm« a book full of useful and agreeable teachings. And to the study of these volumes — these continued annals — fresh in new binding, embellishment and gilding every summer and autumn. Dr. Warder devoted the choicest years of his mature manhood. "It is the enthusiast of a cause who gives vitality and propul sive power. Dr. Warder was an enthusiast in horticulture and in forestry. To advance the race in those two vocations no I was too great for him to undertake, no sacrifice too severe for him joyfully to make. At his own exj&gt;ense he went into fresh territories and states, preaching, as a missionary of a new gos|&gt;el. the importance and necessity of orcharding and tree planting. "His thoughts were strewn, like precion among the dwellers on the prairies of Nebraska. Dakota. Wyoming. Min nesota and the northwest. And they took root, so that the con - cepts of thousands of groves and orchards which now stand M living monuments to his useful life, came from his own philan - thropic brain. In his mind miniature forests grew on every prairie, and golden fruit flashed in the autumn sunlight of every hill side. He knew no limit to his love of horticulture and arboriculture. He was earnest; he was honest, sincere, and his vitaegraph is written wherever flowers bloom, fruits rijien and forests wave all over the country he loved so well and served so modestly, efficiently and faithfully. "His example is worthy of the emulation of our sons and of their sons. And standing at his grave it is meet and proper for this society to recall his noble servii to wish that. </seg>

I thought I could not pay him a better compliment than to read what he had prepared for a predecessor in this work. Dr. Warder. I therefore have taken the liberty to read it. I thank you for your kind attention. HOW TO ADORN THE FARM BOUSE. John Keble has written : "Sweet is the smile of home, the mutual look Where hearts are of each other sure; Sweet all the joys that crowd the household nook, The haunt of all affections pure." The love of home is innate in the heart of every human being. The ideal home is one in which all are in perfect accord, and ambitious to make the most of life, and its opportunities, although each must work in his own particular sphere, and yet loyally stand guard over their united interests. But the ideal farm home is not merely four square walls that will shelter from the sun and rain, and a place to sleep, but should be a bright, cheery place, a true haven of rest to all of its inmates. It matters little whether this home be large or small, certain elements must be considered to have it just the perfect place our imagination pictures. Happy are those who own the homes in which their lives are spent, and thrice happy if they can begin at the foun - dation and build and arrange both buildings and surrounding grounds. But the most of us who have come to Nebraska in the last quarter of a century have found these foundations laid by others, and so must adjust our plans to the existing conditions. In driving through the" country we are struck with the great difference in the appearance of the places we pass by. On the MRS. E. G. JURY, TECUMSEH. </seg>

Our spirits are depressed accordingly and we wish there might be some way to reach the people and show them that as citizens of this great commonwealth of Nebraska it is their duty to make their homes attractive to the passer-by. It has been truly said that "A nation never rises higher than the homes of its people." But I was to say a word about how to make these homes attract - ive, and not \rhy. The first thing I think to be considered is the house in which we are to spend our time. Have it as convenient for your work as possible, but also add as many touches in the way of odd corners and nooks as you can afford. Be liberal in the matter of porches, for they will prove to be Imth tiseful and ornamental. Then paint the exterior nicely, and in these matters individual taste should be considered. Paint, or what is perhaps better, oil. the interior woodwork. Then the walls should l&gt;e nicely paired, and to-day this is not such a great burden of expense as it was a few years ago. as just as dainty colors and patterns are found in the medium grades as in the higher priced. I think any woman who can make a room look tempting and homelike with cold white walls is possessed of wonderful capabilities. Let the cur - tains, floor covering, and furniture of the different rooms be chosen to accord with your own ideas of the particular needs of those apartments. But the things which aid in making the sun - shine and brightness of these rooms should not be forgotten. For the dining-room have an abundance of table linen with bright dainty glassware and china. It is surprising to find how beautiful are the table articles in pressed glass and semi-porcelain china, and practically inexpensive. Do not understand me to mean by this that the farmer's family should have only the inferior. Not so. But if we are to keep our homes attractive, we must procure </seg>            
            <seg id="p203">206 NEBRASKA STATE HOBTICl'LTL'KAL SOCIETY. for everyday use that which shall also prove useful as well as ornamental. And the average farm housewife, who must also be an adept in at least a dozen distinct vocations, will not rate to be burdened with fragile china, etc., for constant use. Let these be reserved for special occasions. Then adorn your walls and tables with choice pictures and etchings. Have numberless cushions both for use and ornament, and books and papers galore. But do not neglect the outside of your domain, but see to it your yard is well seeded with grass; a mixture of blue grass and white clover we have found best suited to this climate: keep it nicely cut with lawn-mower. "It will prove a thing of beauty and a joy forever." Here and there have trees planted— not very many — of the thrifty, branching varieties. Elms are especially valuable as shade trees. Also have a very few ornamental trees; wild olive is fine, as its various shades of silver are a constant pleasure. But there is a large variety to select from. No evergreens? Yes. of course; but reserve these to be planted as wind-breaks or in groups at the sides, for the only good way to grow an evergreen is to allow it to be natural. If planted for a shade tree, it must be trimmed and is then far from ornamental, an unsightly object. we must have evergreens, for when we list to the winter's chilling blast, and all nature looks brown and barren, we turn to them with their wealth of summery green and our thoughts are turned from nature up to nature's God, and we seem to catch a glimpse of the land where "it is always summer and storms no more shall come." And last, but not least, be sure to have an abundance of flowers, both in and around your home. For in doors select those which are best suited for the windows yon must use. But you will be amply repaid for all the trouble to raise them. For the porches have plenty of vines, if a permanent shelter is desired, a plant of the wild grape vine, also the common five leafed ivy is good, but if you wish the space clear in winter, use that prince of climbers, clematis paniculata. The cinnamon vine is good also. Or take some of the annuals, as morning glory. wild cucumber, or the flowering bean. These will all yield a </seg>

Then plant beds of bulbs for early or fall blooming, with a goodly variety of the hardy shrubs. These give large returns for time and labor expended on them. But for a continued bloom ing we must depend quite a good deal on our annuals or per - ennials, and while many of the new sorts are excellent, be sure not to forget the old friends. The petunias, verbenas, asters • ombs, phlox drmmnondii. portulaea. etc.. that begin to bloom early and stay till killed by the frosts. What would our homes Ik* without the flowers? We gat he them to deck the rooms tor all social occasions, and "when Wi welcome the coming or speed the parting guest." We deck th - bridal chamber with blossoms because they speak of hope an&lt; sunshine. And when our loved ones leave us for a brighter. l&gt;. land, again we strew them with lavish hand, for they speak to 11 of immortality, of a land that knows no death. "In eastern lands they talk with flowers And tell in a garland their hopes and fears. And we have learned this lesson also. Does all this seem like theory, but hard to achieve? It is only what may be seen in nearly every community; but I hope the time will soon come when every farm home will not only l&gt;e ■ place to exist in, but also l&gt;eautiful and speak to the world in unfaltering tones, that the truest, most useful life, most restful life, can be lived away from the bustling, busy markets. Then shall we be able to prove our assertion that life on the farm is no more one of drudgery than that lived in the towns. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">208 V 8TAXK HORTIOuI/TI. It A I MY EXPERIENCE WITH ONE THOUSAND STRAWBERRY PLANTS. DE. JA8. B. HUNGATE. The ground selected for the planting had been cleared from brash and trees for six years and used as a garden and planted to apple and cherry trees. It lay just west of the barn, and had received liberal applications of well rotted manure and the drain from the horse and the cow lot. The slope was to the north toward the Weeping Water, distant about two hundred yards. In April, 1901, I received from the Titus Simij Coapaaj one thousand plants of the following varieties in equal quant i - ties, viz.: Warfleld. Splendid, Bisel, and Brandywine. The ground was well prepared with a one-horse Hapgood plow and ;m Iron Age harrow. With the aid of an assistant and a spade F set the plants in rows four feet apart, and plants sixteen inches apart. Every third row we encountered an apple or cherry tier twenty-four feet apart. I put fifty plants of one variety in a row, and then changed to another kind. We found when we had finished that there were thirteen rows 112 feet long ; and as they were four feet apart, the width of the patch was fifty-two feet : or 5,824 square feet of the lowest part of the enclosure, about two-fifteenths of an acre, was to be our strawberry patch. Weekly cultivations with plow, harrow and hoe were given until the rain came in August. No weeds were allowed to grow and the surface between the rows was covered with dust, and the dryest time moisture could be found on kicking the dust aside with the foot. I judge that about 80 per cent of the plants lived; those dying being the ones nearest the fruit trees, and those that were tramped on by the horse in cultivating. In the autumn runners began to spread and new plants to take root. I visited them almost daily from the time they were planted and when I could see a new plant in prospect I gave it needed help by freshen ing a spot in the row and placing the embryo plant therein and covering its tiny rootlets with a handful of the richest and </seg>
            <seg id="p206">209 moistest earth. When the cool wesrther of November b&lt; rows were green to the width of a foot with big hanl\ and I began to think of putting them to bed for the winter. I morning before breakfast found me with the wheelbarrow and fork placing all the stable litter we had saved during the summer. and five loads from the livery stable I had bought at fifteen cents a load, between the rows; and at the wm time I refill not to get any of it on the plants or too near to them, for fear of heating them and causing them to rot and die. By Dernaber 1 had finished that step in their care and ordered two l&lt;&gt;;i&lt;' clean old wheat straw which I began to place over the plant! themselves to the depth of not over two inches, placing it care - fully and evenly so that all were concealed but not lost n the blanket of straw. This was finished on December IStk, and on the 14th the thermometer was 14 degrees Mow zero at our place and I was hugging myself that niv (M'ts were safely asleep in their clean, warm beds. Tn early April I began to wake them up and to pull the cover apart a little that they might get a peep ;st the warm sun. I was delighted to find them all alive and as green as they were when I put them asleep. Heavy rain and the spring thaw had cut some ditches across the bed and knocked the blanket awry, and thrown mud into the crowns of some plants, and up - rooted others; but I replaced them with my hands, leveled up the ground and rearranged the blanket. Then another - would come and cover all and still they slept safely and all the unsightliness was hidden. When I read in the fruit paj&gt;ers that the strawberry would be a short one this year because of the fact that the plants had winter killed, T again hugged myself that mine were yet and I would probably be eating strawberries with plent Jersey cream, thick and fat, when others were wishing they had some to eat. I was reminded of the Scotch grace and kept hum - ming it to myself as T spaded between the rows with the potato fork, turning over the mulch and earth: "Some ha'e meat and can na eat. And some ha'e nane that want It ; But we ha'e meat and we can eat, And say, the Laird be thankit.' 8 </seg>

Whenever during; the summer I had noted an absent plant, o when we found that the plants had given out before the row wa quite finished beiug set. I went and got a wild plant from th orchard fence row and put it in the place of (he absent one. did this with the hojH' that the pollen from the wild berry wouli ■&lt; fertilize the highly bred plants and give the fruit flavor am abundance. I have continued the practice again this year, bu the results are still undecided in my mind yet. The plants blossomed in profusion al&gt;out Maj (5th to 15th and looked very pretty in white and green with a background of brown straw. How eagerly we watched for the first ripe berry and finally found it about May 20th. and by the 2.Sd we had our first dish of Splendid strawl&gt;erries. both in name and quality, on our table. From that time on for a month we have had them at every meal. Our family consists of live persons all big enough to eat berries, and it was not considered a breach of etiquette to up the dish for more when one dish had been dispatched. Then again we had more company, at which we were highly pleased, during strawberry time than at other times, and more visitors came, "just to see that patch of strawberries of yourn. Doc," so we invited them to pick and eat. and gave them a U&gt;\ and told them to pick it full and take it home with them that the family might enjoy them too. Of the varieties, all were good and it would be difficult to say which of them were the best. The lirandywine was the biggdt, firmest, and would stay on the longest without being picked with out damage of any of the others, but its flavor was not in it with the dark red Warfield with its calyx turned back on the stem. making it so easy to pick and stem, but it was tender and easily crushed. The Splendid was the earliest, roundest and certainly has the proper name, but the Rise], while not so large nor round, gave the greatest number of berries. One row that was planted with the last two named kinds gave at one picking ten quarts of the finest ever seen and I gave the boy that picked it a silver quarter for doing so. In order to encourage my own little girls to earn something for </seg>
            <seg id="p208">ONE THOUSAND STRAWBERRY VI 211 themselves I agreed to pay two and a half cents a quart for pick ing. and found that I was a cent above the regular price for that kind of labor. One girl earned a dollar for about tive hours' work, and all the boys and girls that heated us did well financially as long as the berries lasted. I kept an accurate account with the patch, and charged it with all items of expense, and gave it credit for all buiki sold, but none in figures for those eaten or given away. The beiikai were all sold in the home market, and nearly all by one gro&lt; man, and five times as many could hav&lt; -old if I had had them, so I might have supplied the demand. The telephone was in use as a means of communication between the house and the grocery and whenever a crate was ready the grocery man was only too ready to know it, as he had them already sold over the phone for dinner or supper as the case might be. He would his delivery wagon after them, and thus relieve us of any trouble but the picking and crating in the patch. The public w r for them and complimentary in their praise of the quality of the fruit. The crop retailed for twelve and one-half and fifteen cents a box. I took my pay from the dealer in his scrip, that was . for its face in merchandise at his store, or any dry foedi store, and it was the same as money to me. Thus I realized $3 and $3.60 Der crate for the entire crop. The total receipts from the berries sold was f."&gt;«;.-t."&gt;. Tht pense for picking, crates and boxes was $11.80. This leaves a net profit of $44.65, or in other words I received that amount for my investment of $5 for 1.000 plants, the money I paid out for hired labor, the rent value and taxes on the real estate, and my own labor performed at odd times and as a matter of exercise and recreation. There are several little examples in practical arithmetic that one can work out, taking these figures as a I' e. g. : If two-fifteenths of an acre produce a net profit of $44.66, one-fifteenth of an acre will equal %'2'2M'2L or an acre under the same condition will yield a net profit of $334.87^. This imm take into account the fact that the family were supplied with berries for a month to eat. bcaMn ■&gt; goodly numlier canned for </seg>

Tt is fair to conclude that there were produced and not marketed at le.iv crates of an average value of $3. as there was no expense for boxes, crates, or picking, which would add |18 to the net amount produced. Then we would have !&lt;'»:.».&lt;;."&gt;. or *400.S7} per acre as the net profit: and the total gran production of an acre of straw berries with ideal care and conditions of $558,371. I think so well of my experiment that I gave Youngers &amp; &lt; '• for 650 plants of the following varieties, viz. : Nick Ohmer. Ruby, and Wm. Belt. These were small and had lain in the freight office for five days waiting for the agent to arrive to get them out. as they were consigned to him. and the weather being dry the middle of April, less than 50 per cent of them lived when given exactly the same treatment and set alongside the other patch. I have a suspicion that the varieties of these last may not prove true to name, but T shall find out when they fruit. I replanted spaces left vacant by the dead ones with plants taken up from between the old rows of my own plants, which were much better and stronger than those I bought. These have mad'' a vigorous growth so far this season under ideal treatment. At the close of the berry season T have taken up with plenty of earth on and reset 850 more plants, thus finishing the enclosure with strawberries, or one-third of an acre to fruit next season. There are also a few, one-half dozen experimental plants, set early thin spring, of the variety known as the Gardner, which T shall watch with jealous care, with the hope of having something extra fine. Cultivation will proceed weekly when the ground is dry enough to work by running the pU&gt;w. harrow, and hoe after every rain to break the crust, and prepare the dust mulch to conserve the already abundant moisture which has fallen. There were nine inches in this locality in June, and July opens out with an inch and a half more. The plants recently set have not appeared to know that they have been disturbed. When the time comes the same process of mulching and cover for enrichment and winter protection will be resorted to as last year.

I believe that one can buy the best acre in this much favored fruit district at flOO set it to strawberries of varieties that are known to do well here, give them intensive culture and care, and pay for the ground the first year; then have the next three or four years as a clear profit to himself. Hut uo sluggard need apply. Weeds must not be allowed to grow; the definition of a weed is, a plant out of place; the strawberry plant and w never marry and they are much out of place in a weed patch.

They forgot to mention their real cause of failure, which was neglect and lack of forethought, and argued that l&gt;e - cause they had failed I must surely do likewise.

We can beat that all to pieces. We keep a close account of all our berries. I can tell you at the end of the month every cenfs worth of fruit, all the berries we have sold, and we know what it has cost us to produce them, and the doctor's estimate is low on his strawberries. While T have not tested all of the varieties he has tested, undoubtedly he has some good ones. Mr. O. P. Christy — Have you the Ruby? Mr. C. H. Barnarp — No. I don't have the Ruby. Dr. Elongate he paid two and one-half cents a quart for picking. My pickers T hire by the day. because when you pay by the box they all want to pet one row — they all know the l&gt;est row — hut if yon hire by the day you can say. pick here or there. T use my regular monthly help for picking berries and T find it very profitable. This year T paid $2") a month and board and we thought it wn* money well expended. Mr. H. F. MiTntosh — I was in a patch where they paid only one and one-half cents for picking, and so T think Dr. TTnngate was amusing the children when he paid two and one-half rents a box. Mr. C. H. Barnard — Dr. Hungate gets better prices than w* did. Last year we got fl.ofl a crate. This year we got *2. Mr. W. &lt;J. Swan — Ts Barnnrd's bed as clean as the doctor'g? Mr. C. H. Barnard — As far as the new ones are concerned, we keep them clean: but for old ones, this year we just couldn't do it. There was too much rain to keep our old patches "leaned out. Our patches planted this spring for next year's crop- - and we get our best crop the second year — two mowings with a mowing machine is perhaps the best they will get this year. Then the third year we will plow them up. Mr. T&gt;. M. Rissell — Dr. Hungate wanted me to criticise his paper and I thought I would just stand up and tell him that T caunot do it. He was sj&gt;eaking of the Gardner, that he planted them and exj»ected something fine. T think lie will be disap - j&gt;ointed. The Gardner is a good berry, but too coarse, like a </seg>

He will always have something to &lt;!• believe I have known the doctor to have a lonesome time of it because people were provokingly healthy, but T warrant when he is in the strawberry business he will always have - thing to do. Mr. J. E. Atkinson — T would like to ask if the calyx didn't wither sometimes so that the berries are not salable, particularly on the Splendid variety? Dr. Hungate — I would like to answer that question. The calyx of the Splendid does wither, but I have never known ■ per - son to make an objection to the calyx being bad. They want more berries all the time. T keep mine nice and clean. I only had two-fifteenths of an acre and I could tell the difference in the berries, and I did notice these dead calyxes on the Splendid, but in putting them in the box I always put the dead calyx down and they bought all the berries all right and wanted more. About the picking. I had to pay these children cash. T wanted to employ my children, so I said T would give two and one-half cents.

I get out every morn - ing and pull out every bit of grass and every bit of weeds and when I have it all clean it is as clean as a floor. Ken year 1 will have more, about 2JBM strawberry plants. I took just four varieties and tried these four. I have three more. I don't know whether I have them or not, but I think 1 have them. They are just young ones. I don't have any kick coming on the Gardner. They may be too hollow, but I will find that out. and that is what we learn; we learn something all the time; and the possibilities of this district for growing small fruits — I know that, take it for one season, that it has been almost boundless in amount and profit and it is beneficial to anyone. So next year we will have a paper on 12.5OO strawberry plants. Me. G. 8. Christy — Were not your Splendid, with the dead calyx, good berries all the same? Dr. Hungate — Oh, yes. They always went down in the box and my wife always pulled them off when we used them on the table and we had plenty of Jersey cream and you pat them into your mouth and smile and it slips down and you MWr know whether it had a calyx or not. Mr. Silas Wilson — Do you have the Rederwood? Dr. Hingate — No. Mr. Silas Wilson — Now that is the best of all. I mention that because it is the best strawl&gt;errv we have.

"No good on earth." He had bragging up everything else, but he didn't like this. Mb. Silas Wilson — Too common for him. Mr. G. S.

Dr. Hungate — I think you must get the variety suitable fur your conditions. Some will fail one plan that will sn another place, and that is the reason we get such a di\ opinion as to varieties, when it all depends — a great deal dejx — upon the location. I would advise no one to have too man rieties. They say a man with less than four varieties is m it, and a man with more than seven is out of it. Mr. E. W. Dole — We have tried a Bomber of them. — \i&lt; wood, Parker Earle, and others. Mr. Harnard said he didn't cultivate; mowed off his patch after the first year. Would not have done better if better tended? Mr. C. H. Barnard — We never made a practice of tending I the second year. We find it is a good deal easier to plant a new patch thau to keep an old one clean. Mr. E. W. Dole — We put in an acre and cultivated them the next year we got a crop and we weeded it once before ing and as soon as the picking was over we veeded the bi and the following year the same way. We run them tin to the patch and keep weeding them once or twice before the weeds ripen. We had over $800 worth of berries in three crops. The second crop was the heavier Mr. &lt;i. S.

            <seg id="p215">218 Me. H. F. McIxtosh — I am afraid the audience will miss tto chief virtue in this paper; not how much money T»r. Bungate makes off his patch, but the fact that he finds the strawberry bed extremely interesting and valuable as a part of the home equip - ment. If any farmers were here — T suspect you arc all citv people — I would say to the farmers: Farmers arc too much accustomed to think they cannot succeed with strawl&gt;erri« that they are not worth while to prow. T offer the suggestion that the reason for the farmer's opinion on that subject is that he has tried to prow strawl&gt;erries as he prows onions — he hat planted them in little beds and planted the rows about a foot apart and attempted to keep them clean by weeding them. The result is that with the arrowing of the plants, the thickening &lt;&gt;f the plants, and the growth of weeds when cultivation is Impoa - sible, your strawberries have not been a success. The remedy for that is rational: Planting jnst as Dr. TTungate advises, four feet apart, one or two feet apart in the rows. Then cultivate them with a horse. Plant them like potatoes rather than onions and study the nature of the plant so you can control it instead of letting it control yon. and it is easier, twenty times easier. to have a crop of strawberries in your home garden than it i* to have a crop of onions and the strawberries are twenty times more enjoyable than the onionR. That is the main point in the whole case. Dr. Hungate — Like Mr. Mclntosh. the esthetic side appeals very strongly to me and T am glad he brought it out — the jo one gets out of a thing beautiful in form and color, soinethin to gratify their sense of the esthetic. No one is too poor t have something out of nature that is the real thing, not counterfeit, and the result in the flavor, the color, the shape, th size — I can gratify my sense of the esthetic, and everyone can by trying to raise a strawberry or a beautiful bird or soinethin that will be a good deal more good than a picture hanging on dead wall.

            <seg id="p216">219 GBOWING EVERGREENS FROM SI GROWING EVERGREENS FROM SEED. HARRISON. YORK. This is one of the most difficult tliinjrs in horticulture. After twenty-five years of experience I am convinced tliiit torn kinds cannot be successfully raised frmu seed in &lt;&gt;nr climate You may have exactly the same methods, tin* same seeds, am everything the same, but the climate, and yon cannot make it b the usual outdoor process. I never got a good stand of |i pungens. When east T have seen l&gt;eds of them as thick as liai on a dog. You can raise them all right in boxes in the h - but our climate is too savage for tender things. They can be grown all right; there is no trouble about that. Have a lions* built for it. with a moderate degree of heat. ITave them shell from the terrific drying winds of spring. They will start readil enough. Then you can toughen them gradually to the weather Leave them in their boxes or shelf for two or three years am then put them under screen for two years. Move them wlie they are ready for the open. This is something the state should take hold of, either through the Horticultural Department of the College or through the exj&gt;eriinent station. Tt would cost per haps two to five hundred dollars to get I plant suitable for ex periments. Then they could be turned out by the million. The needs of Black Hills spruce, piceas pungens and engelnianni are very small and the plants are very tender so they need - help for a start. Abies concolor is a very difficult evergreen to raise from - I have raised thousands of them and the seed does not come high, but the yield from the seed is light. I have raised them nicely in a box in the house: when the same seed was planted out of doors I did not get a plant, and yet in the mountains I have known the squirrels to drop cones in moist place* where they kept damp all winter and every and would sprout. I have often seen where cattle stepped on a green cone and pressed it </seg>

SOCIETY. into the earth the plants would come up in a mass and in col - lecting we always secured these clumps because we could spade out such fine, long roots. I think with these we would do Iwtter to plant the seed and never allow them to dry till they ger - minate. They are very soft and I think are injured in gathering, especially when the seed men wish to do a nice job and hull them. The easiest evergreens to raise are Norway spruce, Scotch pine and the easiest of all, the ponderosa pine, unless we except the Chinese arborvita*. which is the surest to grow of all, and never damps off, and it is very thrifty. I have known them to make a foot a year in the seed bed. I was induced to raise them by Robert Douglas, who recoil mended them as the best tree for the hot states of the west ant southwest. I think he was right. I have had excellent sn with them and they do well in Kansas and Oklahoma and ther is quite a call from those states. The seeds are not large bu they germinate well and stand our climate. You see advertise ments in our papers in the spring advocating northern MbanlUB for Kansas and Nebraska. They are worse than worthless. Last spring I planted one thousand under screen and a lot of the Chinese in the open to be cuffed and burned and scorched by the awful heat. They rather enjoyed it, but the Americans under cover panted and died. Well, let us take a trip to the mountains and gather some seeds. One year we followed in the wake of a sawmill. The men took the logs and let us have the tops, so we could gather rapidly. But generally we let the squirrels do the work. They can climb so much better than we. I have l»eeu in those high altitudes when the trees would be burdened with cones and in three weeks there would not be one to be seen. It is a busy time for l&gt;oth squirrels and seed gatherers. It would l&gt;e cruel to the squirrels were it not for the fact that they cut off ten times as much as they can possibly consume. Bat their idea is to leave nothing. •They will take a large tree say of the concolor. the coin which are as large as an ear of small sweet corn, and in a short time the stems will 1m&gt; gnawed off and the cones come thumping </seg>
            <seg id="p218">221 to the ground. Sometimes the cones are worthies did not mature. These the iquirrrti never touched. We &lt;lid. hut found them useless. At first we used to climb and gatln great expense and trouble, but now our collectors almost en - tirely depend on the squirrels. If a man wants the hardest scold - ing he ever had let him fill a bag with cones while the little fcl low is at work up the tree. He tells him in plain language he is a thief and a robber and if he was not so large he would come down and give him the biggest thrashing he ever hail and some times he would start to do it anyhow, but the nearer he not to his enemy the bigger he looked and then he would go back an.l work a while and scold a while. The most singular thing aliout the little fellow is the va keeps the seeds. They must be kept fresh or he cannot use them. Tf they should not he would starve. Tie has places where he stores them among old well-rotted cones. He s'tands them m end in clusters of about a double handful and sprinkles some old cone dust between them; then covers them lightly and sometimes under a single tree the man will get two or three bushels. The cones are put in sacks and bound on burros or horses and taken to camp, where they are spread out on large sheets to dr.\ . They are then threshed out and put through a fanning mill and are ready for market. The industry has grown immensely. Our collectors in Beulah, Colorado, gather nearly a ton a year; many of these go to Europe. One year we sent a lot to plant I'rince Bismark's estate a few vears before he died. Having gotten the seeds, now for planting. Make a pen eight feet by thirty-two long. In this climate yon must have a pea which will come down to the ground or the wind will blow under and mow down the young trees. You can cover this pea with a double row of lath screens. These are nailed together four feet square for ease in handling. Of course you have spaded up the bed and raked it down fine. Get it level. Sow the seed, rake them lightly, then cover evenly with half an inch of fine sand. </seg>
            <seg id="p219">222 WHEN TO SOW Many of the coarser kiuds. especially the ponderosa, should E sowed in the fall. That is nature's way. They come up earh the spring. The great danger to seedlings is the damps, which ts them down as with a knife. This danger menances them when they have the first set of leaves. When they get a second set they have hardened so thoroughly there is but little danger. There would be no need of shading the ponderosa only to keep the bed from drying out. One thing you must observe: Never let the bed dry when tlu seeds are germinating. For this reason you should have youi beds not far from water. A sprinkler is better than a hose. es|» cially if there is much force back of it. Care should be taken to have the land as clean as possible. I have about ten beds eight by thirty-two. I got a new piece of ground and broke i last summer, plowed and disked it in the fall ; but it was tin weediest piece I ever saw. There was no white clover whei plowed, but there had been jears before and the seed had laii dormant for years and it is the worst weed on earth with ; long, tough root, and of course in weeding many plants mi injured and disturbing the young plants seemed to induce th« damps. Then, as never before in the history of the state tin cutworms were on hand and mowed down the young plants ;i&gt; they came up. There are two kinds of cut-worms, the common brown and the black. The black one usually comes under a screen which is two or three years old. It likes such places and it lets nothing escape. The common brown one is bad enough, but he will leave one now and then. If one is raising evergreens he needs to invoke providence am providence will send a few toads for you to take care of and thest will take care of the cutworms. Years of drouth had killed our toads, hence the terrible work of the cut worms last spring. II&lt; is not a very handsome animal and yet you may take off you hat to him as one of the most faithful friends you ever had and if one is raising things which require much care, like the ever </seg>
            <seg id="p220">223 green, he should keep a colony he can move from place to place as needed. Of course you must keep jam seed beds well weeded and for most kinds keep the screens on the first year and till the.v l&gt;ef;in to start the next spring. If you wish to plant out in the open vou should let your * lings stand three years. I have planted out pondi : thin age and not lost more than five per cent. At two .vears they are too young. The foliage is too near the hot earth and the Joss will be very heavy. If you transplant under screen vou can take plants two years old. Let them stay under cover the year, take it off the second. We usually let evergreens stand two years before transplanting. It takes them al&gt;out a year t' well rooted. If you raise ponderosas, which is the fats jreen of western and central Nebraska, leave in the seed bed three j Plant in the open, and let them remain two or three yean lo and then plant where you wish them to stay. The Austrian is a grand pine. Twenty five wars aga I planted some catalpas and they have kept up with them. One great trouble with the Austrian is, it is the worst evergreen in the whole catalogue to damp off. 1 have planted in the fall but the seed is not as hardy as the pouderosa and does not germinate bo well. There is the same trouble east. It is twice as easy to raise the worthless Scotch as the Austrian. Chinese arboi you can transplant easily when it is two years old. Now as to red cedar. I have been at great expense and troubl to raise these trees. I was sure that in the forest the seed neve germinated till it first passed through a bird. I have a inn in the mountains and no red cedar within a mile and yet unde the screen nice little silver cedars would come up. Nothing bu birds could have carried them. But the silver cedar is not native cedar. There is only one seed in a berry and that is &lt;a»e&lt; in a very horny covering. It is certain, though, that birds do much in scattering our red cedars. On this supposition I saved several bushels of &gt;■ </seg>
            <seg id="p221">224 washed off the pulp and had a peck of fine clean seed. These I fed to a flock of confined fowls, intending to plant the droppings. I was sure I had the thing cornered. I paid hut little attention till they were all eaten and then I found every seed completely digested, hoof, horns, hide and all. Hut at the same time I the seed which floated on top. mixed it with sand and put it in a box. Now the box did not have the drainage it should, and the seeds in the bottom were water soaked and drowned. But after all I planted those poorest seeds and most of them killed, and yet I got quite a lot of nice trees. So gather ymir seed this fall : 'lay in sand in a box; have perfect drainage in the bottom; bury the box a foot deep; leave it a year; take the seed up am! them the next fall as yon do other evergreens; and in the spring you can have them by the thousands. But is it best to have so many red cedars? Tn my neighbor's yard are Austrian pines and red cedars planted twenty -tw ■&gt; years ago and the pines are four times as large as the cedars. Some claim that cedar fungus is the cause of apple-tree rust. Most of our experiment stations have so decided. They are as difficult to start as any evergreen we have. T have planted the ponderosa beside them and had a far better stand. They do not begin to transplant with the pungens. The loss, do the you can. will be twice as heavy. This year a large part of trans planted cedars have blighted and the dread of blight hangs over the seedlings and often whole beds of thousands will be com pletely wiped out by it. Nebraska is a good country for evergreens if you plant the right kinds. I have gathered hundreds of thousands in the nionn tains and raised an immense amount from seed and had us soon raise an evergreen as a cottonwood. T did not lose more than two per cent in pungens this spring. The concolor is called the hardest tree on earth to handle. You never will forget last Arbor Day. We had to hold our boxes from blowing away and sometimes we had to run after them, but on that terrible day. fighting the wind, we planted several hundred concolor and did not lose more than five per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">225 This year I am testing the pinus monophylla or the pinou tree. I find the large seeds sold for nuts in Denver ami other western towns. They grow readily and I have hundreds that have come up but cannot tell how they will make it yet. Some one iu Nebraska should raise evergreens by the million. They will be needed. They will stand the drouth which kills other They, more than anything else, will arrest hot winds, temper the winters, shelter the stock ami make the farm home-like in winter. They can be raised for profit, too. There is an agita tion in Kansas of raising catalpas to take the place of white pirn as a timber tree. That is all right, but with us some of the ever greens keep up with the catalpa and will probably 1h&gt; as valuable An immense problem of redeeming the plains is before us. and it must be done with evergreens. DISCUSSION. Mm. Bei.tzer — We all have our little hobbies and sometimes we get an elephant on our hands we don't know what do with. I got into trouble with my cedar seed once and I did not know what to do with it. I wrote to Dundee, Illinois, to Mr. Hill, to brother Stephens and brother Harrison for information. Now the reason I am interested is that* I have had considerable ex - perience with evergreens and I have almost come to the conclu - sion that the cedar is the Nebraska evergreen. I think it hardy as anything else and I expect my wife would verify the statement. I want something to control. I want to absolutely keep it where I want it. and I can keep the cedar where I want it and in any shape. I don't believe I ever knew of a cedar when once thoroughly established to die in this country and so I am interested, or would like to be. I guess one man in the state of Nebraska knows how to propagate cedar seed and he j;ives it iu plain language: Don't make any inquiry in regard to prop ing cedar seed. I am anxious to know, as brother Harrison gave most of the conditions, and I would like to bring out that little fact and hear from him just how to propagate it from his ex - perience. He tried to tell in the letter, but it was pretty hard 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p223">226 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. to do. I have tried several different ways. I have soaked some of the seed and planted it out, soaked from sixteen to twenty days, some soaked in ashes, some in lime water, planted it in layers and covered it with sand, leaving it lay there, or planted out several rows — different ways. Then I also tried to follow his ideas, as he wrote me, about putting it in a box. but I didn't know just how to do that. I guess I made a mistake. I put in a layer of sand three or four inches deep, put the seed on top of that and covered that with sand and kept it wet. That is as far along as I got. Mr. Harrison — Did you take the pulp off the seed? Mr. Beltzer — My dear sir, I have some work to do up there. You would have to take it off with your fingers and I have work to do. Mr. Harrison — Mr. Dunlap has had some experience. I want to hear from him. Mr. Dunlap — Mr. President, it is an old saying: If you want to make a rabbit stew you must first catch a rabbit; if you want to learn to pick strawberries you must first have a patch; and if you want to train a grizzly you must first get the grinly ; so when you go to grow red cedars you first must have the fraud adapted to that purpose, but as far as making red cedar grow, I think you can grow them just as surely as beans. Take the pulp off and take it off with a screen and then take a soft brick and rub them. Take and mix them with dirt to get them cleaner and let them stay a week. (Jet this soft clay; it does better yet. Take that gum off and plant them early in the spring. Never put them in sand. If you do they will sprout and start before you plant them. Another way is to put them in wind when you get them, and let them stay for a whole year. The gum will gradually rot off. Another way is to put them in one winter in dirt and let them stay until the coming fall and then plant them. 1'nless you have the ground and conditions for growing them all these will fail. If the ground is not moist you cannot grow them. In dry ground, unless you can irrigate them, the ground will crack and many of your plants will die. I believe it is better </seg>
            <seg id="p224">227 to call on some person in the business and have the ground adapted for the purpose. If you want a rosit you can ha\&lt; tailor make it cheaper than you can yourself. The same way with a pair of shoes. But if you want to pwv them, you can _ the red cedar as easy as beans. Mit. ALBBCH — 1 have had a little experience. I have sold great many and have them all the time but the birds do th business for me. I suppose they do. The trees come up under th apple trees all over. I wish to say this: Someone said that h fed the seeds to chickens and they spoiled the seed. That ma be. I never tried that. But if you give a turkey as little nomisl ment as a chickadee, the chickadee will destroy the seed whe the turkey would not. Mrs. Aldrk'h — In respect to cedars we have grown, they have been scattered by birds and they are always propagated on tin - north side of trees and better on a northern sIojk 1 . or if there a pile of brush, which sometimes lies on our place, then fortunate place for the little cedars. We have sold from a thous - and to several thousand each year and we are running out and will not have any more now. T have thought of sending ami getting some to raise. Mr. Barnard — I have not had much experience in cedars l»nt I did once. I pot Borne seed and sowed it under the pine where it was moist and the first year I didn't find a cedar. The second year the trees were just fine — had splendid — cp last year we tried it again but we didn't have any seed last But I think that anyone can grow them if they will stratify them for a year, but it's too long to wait. Mr. Wilson— I think Mr. Barnard is very correct in that. I have had a great deal of experience in different fruits. The Mahaleb cherry is difficult to propagate. You buy the seed and they come to you in a dry condition. If planted in that condi - tion and kept damp you soon can grow a small per eentage &lt;&gt;t those seeds, and they are usually good, but if you stratify them and keep them over one year you can almost be sure of a perfei t stand. The same will apply to a number of fruit seeds. The </seg>

I have only had a limited experience in them, but ;i nurseryman, it would pay him to carry his seed over for a year because then he can act with certainty. He can carry it over in a stratified condition, being careful to keep it damp. The weon year he can depend upon it. You only have to wait a year. Tha is not long for a busy man and if you have seed a year old all th time, which I would certainly do. then you can act with certamti I believe that plan would be well to practice, but I do not believ I would advise a farmer to go to all that trouble. He had bette purchase the same plants of someone who makes it a busincs and he will get better results. The same applies to the Maliale cherry. I have had a great deal of experience with them. The are easy if you give them such care as the seed requires. Lai year I had three hundred thousand and the seed came froi Arkansas. They are growing them in Arkansas now and tin - do well. They plant them green after they pick them but prefer to put them in damp sand and bury it in the ground an keep it until a year old ana" then you can count on it. . I thin eedar seed would do well under the same treatment, being of th same nature. Mr. Harrison — I have very good success with seed by planting it immediately, letting it lay over winter in the ground altout four inches deep and I had an excellent stand. You could not ask anything better. Mr. Dinlap — Didn't a good many come up the second year? Mr. Harrison — I didn't notice. Mr. Din-lap — I usually have the most the second year. Mr. Harrison — I should take exception to his method of keep ing them over winter. I should plant them in the fall. 1 think that point we have overlooked. After taking the pulp off the cedar seed, especially if we leave them in sand a little while, they could be planted in the fall before freezing in a well prepared bed. The bed should have a pen around it so the air will not circulate underneath. In making a lath screen — I have spent a good deal of time on this — you take lath which are four feet long, common </seg>
            <seg id="p226">229 lath, and then have other thick lath, one at each end. and one through the center, and then you put your thin lath across so they project over the other lath about two or three inches, and in this way if your pen is eight feet wide and you put up a ■ section in the center, your sections of lath catch very readih do not slip off. It is very necessary to have this latli Sheltered in this way the ground does not dry out and if you have good soil there is not much trouble. Spade deep. Level it down, put in the seed, covered by half an inch of sand, and 1 think according to Mr. Dunlap's suggestion there would be very little trouble in raising cedars the first year, provided you take the extra pains of putting them in a box with sand and shaking it a while to wear off the gum. In the spring l&gt;e careful with your screen and your pen. The ground will dry slowly if it is well sheltered. You have f conditions. You must watch things and if you find your drying out take a sprinkler and sprinkle them. Wfcea the seed is germinating you must not allow them to dry. The beat way in raising other erergreCM is to plant in the fall. I have been in the Black Hills, a place where the soil has been taken off and right there in the open you will find ponderosas growing about as thick as they ran stand and perhaps the wind has blown them for several rods across the track and there they lie with the sun upon them and they come up readily. moistened by snow in spring - time. Now there is a problem of forestry in the Black Hills. It can't be done by following the teachings of nature. I noi last year where the miners had thrown out the earth and the had fallen it would be easy to gather one hundred plants on a small area, so you are to work under natural conditions. I know they are being raised without any artificial aid whatever. The ponderosa is about as easy to propagate as anything. You the seed in June and lose almost every one of them they cannot resist the sun. Sow in the fall. The damping off c when the first set of leaves is on, and they are tender. Then the second set of leaves come earlier before the hot weather and the plant is then strong enough to resist the heat. I bel uust </seg>

How ever, as more articles are called for on small fruit subjects and the summer horticultural meetings are the place for this discus sion. if I am able in the time allotted to provoke another to good works in this commendable occupation I shall not feel that labor and sincere effort have been expended in vain. Twentieth century horticulture demands of its earnest votaries as necessities what were formerly considered luxuries. Wind, steam and electricity are drafted mankind's carriers to hasten the various products of every land for the daily table and every clime contributes its quota of varied fruits catering to the most delicate and capricious appetite. The people of this country are especially notable as a fruit eating, fruit loving and fruit demanding people. Every year fruit raising becomes more and more a specialty as the cultivator realizes a fruit garden can be manipulated successfully on a small parcel of ground and a berry patch well-tilled is a "health giving, hope-inspiring, happiness-producing" investment, paying heavy dividends for the labor expended on it to its fortunate p Suburban homes are often purchased by toilers in the busy city that they may revel in the luxury of raising the generous small fruits for their own home table. A retired farmer in Illinois, liv - ing on a town acre. prides himself in raising every variety of small fruits congenial to that latitude and is continually surprised and delighted with the amount of pleasure and profit realized from his novel and interesting experiments.

            <seg id="p232">235 SMALL rRUITS FOB PROFIT AND THE TABLE. In raising fruit for profit the home table should the first and most careful consideration. Not only an abundant supply of these health conducing delicacies should be provided. but a variety should be sought for and the l&gt;est and not the refuse used for home consumption. At one time while teaching I boarded with a well-to-do family during a plentiful currant and raspberry year. Mv lunch basket was daily supplied with the rich, red curran tened with brown sugar, while the luscious raspberries found their way to market every morning, never appearing ou the table but once, and then in a fine berry shortcake, accompanied with the assisting dainties, white sugar and rich cream, given to crown a swell dinner to city fri. With Charles Dudley Warner. I considered the currant as well enough, clear as truth, and exquisite in color, yet I ardently longed for a more intimate acquaintance with the "exclusive hauteur of the aristocratic strawberry and the native refinement of the quiet, elegant raspberry." Variety is the spice of life, and too much of a good thing generally grows monotonous. In many of the mountainous districts wild berries grow in the richest profusion and variety and whole families make yearly excursions up the wooded heights to gather for use and market the abundant fruitage. In our own state in a limited degree are found wild grapes, plums, cherries and blackberries, which added much to the scanty provisions of the early settlers. But too many families were then and are now restricted too closely to the "jK&gt;rk barrel, potato bin and bread tray" who might easily have their slender resources supplemented by the unlimited abundance of small fruits if they would give the matter a little forethought and careful attention. The anxious, care-encumbered house and home-maker with her multitudinous duties, has the additional one of providing the 1095 meals during the year. Not only should she have the as - sistance and encouragement from the nourishing vegetable garden and well-filled orchard, but her daily menu should be further extended to the enjoyment of the exquisite delight from small fruits, each in its season, or canned and preserved for </seg>

A producer of great crops of small fruits writes : "Fruit eaten are always good natured. A fruit diet during hot weather means a clear head and strong body. The rich fruit acids the blood and are the great panacea for aches, pains and the blues. It saves family jars, doctors' bills, and enables a poraoa to accomplish more work. It will keep boys and girls &lt;&lt;&gt;n tentedly at home. They see all these nice things in town and forget they are products of the farm. Nothing adds so inix-li to home life as a fruit garden — to enjoy the fruit season von must see things grow. To see the great beauties beginning to turn their color and peep out from foliage so coquettishlv is a great treat. To hoe and cultivate the plants and study their in - dividuality is not hard work but genuine pleasure. The author of "My Summer in a Garden," says: "There is no prettier sight to my eye than a gardener on a ladder in his grape arbor, these golden days, selecting the heaviest clusters of grapes and handing them down to one or another of the group of neighbors or friends who stand under the shade of the leaves flecked with sunshine and cry, 'How sweet!' 'What nice ones!" and the like remarks — encouraging to one on the ladder. It is a great pleasure to see one eat grapes,'' and closes with this philosophical obaerva - tion: ''Nothing shows one who his friends are like prosperity and ripe fruit. I had a good friend in the country I almost never visited except in cherry time. By their fruits you shall know them." Yes, it will be found very profitable to have enough to enjoy with your neighbors and also to divide with those other wel - come or unwelcome visitors, the birds. Next to strawberries, grapes are recommended for large tinan - cial profit but many speak of raspberry culture as a pleasant money producing occupation. Our one time interested fruit grower. W. K.

Currants are so hardy it is amazing that every table is not supplied with this delicious fruit. Dewberries are spoken of M luscious beauties worthy of cultivation. The gooseberry popular fruit and Juneberries are highly praised both for table and canning purposes. There is no better opportunity than now, when times are p to get in the way of raising fine fruit and secure co-operation among the growers to educate people up to the idea that they cannot live without these health producing comforts and always when possible the simple uncooked, unadulterated article, fruit picked fresh from the garden. A home fruit garden or a vine - vard and berry plantation for profit brings pleasant and health ful employment and as one's interest increases in the growing plants his enjoyment becomes greater and instead of finding a hardship the work will prove a great source of pleasure. To sum up this desultory article I will say. partially in the language of one often quoted iu thin essay : "There is fast ac cumulating a vast army of fruit growers who have pushed to the front, rented laud, afterwards paid for it and are now free and independent." They have had grit and go -ahead -itiveness. gunip - tion and get-there-itiveness. They take a pride and find a world of pleasure in their work. They have succeeded in founding pleasant homes with comfortable surroundings. They have a commendable l&gt;ook account and enjoy life as a busy Held yet full of pleasing beauty and sufficient entertainment. "For use and profit then go plant the thrifty vine; Hang purple grape from trellised arbor, latticed frame Let rich-hued berries, with their pristine beauty fine And welcome juicy flavor, your strict attention claim. Since the beginning each in his own season grown. Fair fruit, beneficent for health and wealth to man.

You can make a small patch. Lay the runners as they start into three inch pots and fill them with dirt and as they grow cut them off and transplant them. We have rows now pretty well filled already with this year's runners and we never fail of having a pretty good crop the first year afterwards. IF. J.

Mr. President, Lmiim ami (Irntleinm: The for pre - senting a topic of this character is something like this: In our tate we are particularly blessed this season with an excellent rop of fruit, in many districts a large crop. I am told by Mr. Christy that in Nemaha county there will l&gt;e five hundred car - oads to ship. The horticulturists of the state have so far ben msying themselves with the various problems presenting them- </seg>
            <seg id="p237">240 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. selves in growing fruit, but perhaps we have not given as much attention to marketing our fruit as they have in some other dis tricts. With this thought in view this paper has been prepared and with your indulgence will be surrendered. Present indications point to a prosperous season for the hoi - ticulturists of Nebraska. This leads to a closer studv of the problem of how best to market the products of our orchards, vine yards and small fruit plantations. Most of our growers have more fruit than they can sell in theii local markets and most of us have not yet mastered the problems connected with shipping fruit to other markets and so picking packing and selling as to get the most out of it. In our state w&lt; are also handicapped by the fact that we do not yet have our fruit growers' interests so harmonized and massed as to secure the best possible rates of freight and facilities for distribution. For instance, the writer is shipping fruit some 350 miles over one in and paying therefor 75 cents per case of twenty-four quarts expressage. Our own town is supplied with choice rasp berries shipped from Denver, Colorado, over 400 miles, at ai expense of only 45 cents per case, whether one case or a dozei cases. That is, it costs the Denver grower only 60 per cent a much to ship his products over 400 miles as it costs our grower to ship the same weight 350 miles. This means that those win handle fruit in Denver have so handled and massed their busines as to impress on transportation companies the value of thei business and the necessity of having such rates as will cnabl them to widely distribute their products and get them into th hands of consumers over a wide territory. The fruit growers of Nebraska are not likely to secure the best facilities for transportation with quick service, or to secure the lowest rates of freight and express until they have so ni: their influence and shall have made such an impression with the volume of their products as shall entitle them to and quite likely secure rates and facilities granted to more favored communities. In the study of this problem the writer during the late days of May and the first half of June traveled some 4,000 miles with </seg>
            <seg id="p238">241 a view of investigating what was being done in other fruit grow - ing districts. The effort was made to study the problem in tricts where the methods employed had not given sii' and satisfaction. Also to visit other districts where methods in use were giving satisfactory results. To study the caus&lt; failure in one case and success in the other. With this thought in mind the writer first visited the grape growers in rhautauqua county. New York. The writer desires to acknowledge himself as under obligation to Capt. E. H. Pratt. Wheelock &amp; Clark, to the president of the Gleason Unfemiented Wine Manufacturing Company, and other individuals for information gained. At Fredonia, in Ohautauqua county. N. Y., the production of grapes for table use had reached such targe proportions that in the absence of appropriate concerted efforts to market to tlu&gt; best advantage, returns were sometimes so low as to be dis - couraging and often unprofitable. In the absence of con certed action so many car-loads might be shipped to one market as to depress and break the price in that particular market when in other towns and cities there would oftentimes be a lack of full supply. This led to the formation of a shipping association which would through its superintendent keep in telegraphic com - munication with the leading markets of the country and aim to place each car where there was the most room and the l&gt;&lt; price for it. This combination was also able to secure I favorable terms in purchasing supplies; that is, baskets and fer - tilizers for its members. It was able to distribute its products wisely in distant markets and avoid overcrowding any particular market. So far the association equalled the expectation of its promoters; but serious troubles crept in. ENCOUNTER A SERIOUS DIFFICULTY. The association, however, failed to guard against one serious difficulty, a hardship common to all unions. In a labor union the quickest, strongest and best workmen carry the less skillful and less efficient workmen. So in this crop-growers' union the growers who had soil best suited to vineyard work, who were </seg>
            <seg id="p239">242 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. careful cultivators, who properly fertilized the soil, had their product picked and packed with skill and care, found their superior product selling a 1 the same price as fruit grown on in - ferior land with less careful culture and less care in grading and packing. While the association maintained a corps of inspectors who would examine and check in fruit delivered, it is not prac - ticable in handling many car-loads of fruit daily to inspect with such exactitude as to determine the absolute value of each grower's product. The fruit was sold in car-loads at a stated price per basket. This method, while beneficial to the lews care ful grower, proved to be detrimental in some respects to those who had the best soil, gave the most careful culture, and packed the best product. In a brief time the strongest and best growers in the association found themselves selling their product at a disadvantage. A jobber receiving a car-load of grapes and rapidly distrib - uting them to customers cannot safely pay more for any portion of the car handled as a car-load than the under grades of fruit within the car, since he cannot stop to examine and closely inspect the quality of fruit in each basket. The jobbers' customers in other towns quickly learned not to pay the jobber more per basket than the value of the less carefully grown fruit in the car. Deal ere desiring car-loads of superior fruit began to offer one half cent to one cent more to such large growers as could furnish a car-load of the very best grade. This speedily detached from the association the best* growers, resulting in crippling the as sociation. The immense output of grapes from ('hautauqua county is now so widely known that buyers flock to shipping points and bid for the product, paying the better growers an agreed price per car on track. tin the study of the problem of how to avoid the difficulties hich had crippled the usefulness of the Fredonia Association le writer was advised to visit Anna, Union county, in southern linois. Here, as the guest of Mr. W. W. Thomas, a gentleman lanting and growing 150 acres of strawberries, and Mr. J. W. uller, president of Anna Fruit Growers' Association, the writer </seg>
            <seg id="p240">\ 1 llj^ r I (K AI A K rv t* 1 1 L» FRL IT. 243 was enabled to give some study to this question in the Hgli the experience of fruit and vegetable growers at this point. The Anna Fruit (Jrowers' Association, of Anna, Union county. in southern Illinois, is an example of an association which has succeeded in avoiding the difficulties which have wrecked other shipping associations. Doubtless Union county ships more car - loads of vegetables and fruit than any other county in the state. This region is a continuation of the Ozark range of southern Mis souri. Anna is the highest point between Chicago and the (Julf of Mexico. The large number of people engaged in the growing of vegetables or fruit gave such large shipments as led t&lt;i the establishment of refrigerator car service and fast through freight trains. The writer visited the farm of 401) acres, owned by Mr. C. M. Miller, devoted to orchards and small fruits; also the farm of Mr. J. W. Fuller, president of the association ; and in the course the day was driven through and examined numerous orchards and plantations. The peculiarity of this district was the habit of the growers in planting apple trees at perhaps thirty to thirty - three feet and between the apple trees ]&gt;each and cherry trees, and between these trees rows of raspberries and blackberries, full occupying the entire area. In Nebraska, where we sonietiim have less rain than needed, the orchard ists cannot safely plan but one kind of fruit in an orchard — that is. the apple trees nnis be far enough apart to give the trees needed moisture, and th Nebraska orchardist cannot safely plant trees or small frn plants within an orchard of tree fruits, lest at a critical tin or during the driest portion of the season there should b&lt; than the needed amount of moisture. Kvidently at Anna th amount of rainfall is greater and the planting of small fruits an other trees on the same area seem to be admissible. In raspberries the Miller was grown most freely; the Early Harvest among the blackberries. Mr. Fuller reported 160 !■ - of blackberries per acre as a fair range; L'.")il cases af straw berries as an average yield per acre. Large fields are de\ to the growing of the strawberry.

Large crops of nutmeg melons are grown by some; others grow beans in quantities, often at a good profit. Large pear orchard! are planted but many of them seem to be suffering from blight. I might mention that a great many peaches are grown. .Many planters alternate apple trees with peach trees. SELL PRODUCTS OX THEIR MERITS. The great quantities of vegetables and fruits grown at this point led to the formation of an association of .300 memlters. The association employs a superintendent. The board of directors decides what cities the association will ship to. The association gathers up and ships vegetables and fruit grown by its Loaben or by any other parties not meuiWrs. The large amount they ship in their name enables them to secure better service in the way of freight rates and shipping facilities. The association ships to its own agent at destination ; each member of the associa - tion marks his package with his own individual brand or num - ber ; the shipper builds up and is resjxuisible for his own brand and secures all benefits resulting from making his niiilii i or brand the highest possible in grade. The product of each indi - vidual sells on its merits. The most careful cultivators, graders and packers secure all of the benefits accruing from this superior work or grade. Returns from the commission houses are made, not to the association, but to the individual parties. Return are usually made within three or four days after shipment and ordinarily within twenty-four hours after arrival at destination. The work of the association's agent at each point of destination is to divide up the products of the different consignments con ed in each car; each party consigns to his own commission man at destination. The association, for the sake of securing </seg>
            <seg id="p242">245 the lowest rates of freight, unites all of the smaller shipments into car-loads billed and routed to its own agents. In this way each party sells as an individual, but secures freight rates shipping facilities due to an association of over 3&lt;&gt;0 members. For instance, the vegetable rate to Chicago. 2S4 miles, is the same as the wheat rate, 13.86 cents per 100 pounds, or about 7 cents per bushel on tomatoes. The fruit rate is 17. ."it; cents per lit pounds or about 8 cents a bushel on apples and pears. By ex - press to Chicago a twenty-four quart case of cherries is through for 36 cents. It may be interesting to know that hlackl»erries are not shipped in refrigerator cars, but ship{&gt;ed in dry cars, and it is found that they will stand up thirty-six hours l&gt;etter in what is called a dry car than in an iced or refrigerator car. The association pays f4 per ton for ice with which to ice cars. Cars are iced in the morning before loading in the afternoon. It is found that the warm fruit fresh from the fields causes the ice to melt rapidly. This compels them to ice the cars again before reaching Chicago. The marked success of this association seems due to the fact that each and every memlter gets the lienefit of purchasing fertil - izers, boxes, baskets, etc., in large quant it ies through the associa - tion at cost, and to the association's methods of getting informa - tion where to ship, also to the low rates of freight and ex) secured by the association. As each individual's consignment is sold on its merits without reference to any other consignment in the same car. the low grade products sent out by some growers in no way detract from the quality or wiling price of the product of the best growers consigned in the MM car. Evidently the association should buy collectively; should ship together to avail themselves of car-load rates and quicker service but should sell, not as an association but as individuals when their product reaches the market. In this way the stronger men and the most careful cultivators secure all the ln-netits of their superior skill and care and they are in no way n'sjKinsible for or have to stand the loss incident to the marketing of the inferior products of less skilful growers. </seg>

Christy — We don't have to go far to find out what an as tion can do. With the railroads of course we have been try - ing to do a good deal of legislation, but railroads take advantage of us. About two years ago this fall our railroads in the eastern part of the state advanced the minimum of a car load of apples from 2(l.0lHl to 24.000. This last year, while not changing the I, they changed the classification and our apples are changed higher rate and it makes quite a difference. I don't know that apples are heavier than other things, but I sent a car of apples to Creeley. Colorado, and the rate was 7." cents per hun - dred. I loaded a car of potatoes and sent them back and paid ins. Of course they have a down hill pull coming this way. but I don't believe there is that much difference. That came from the fact that the people there at Greeley formed an associatiou; had a big lot of potatoes then — thousands of car-loads — and went to the railroads and told them the price potatoes were at the time and the market they had to ship to. and they would to have a lower rate, and the railroads made them one and they have kept it. I believe if growers of apples in this part of 'ate will form an association and send a good representation an have a rate of almost half. They won't pay any attention to what an individual says, nor to the legislatures. They are not always railroad men. and while they change the rate the railroads change the classification so it don't make any difference. I don't want to rob the railroads, but fruit ought to be ■hipped for less that it has been and we should be getting our share. The • le in Greoley went to work and got it and we can do it too. 1Mb.

Williams — It seems to me the question involved in Mr. Stephens' paper is very pertinent. Last year we raised more than enough for the trade and it was quite a question with some of us what to do with the surplus here. Two years ago I was in Colo - rado. They had a fine crop of apples there and after I came back a friend of mine wrote me they had no market for apples at all, were getting nothing out of them. When I was there they were shipping apples from Canon City at 40 cents a bushel. It seems to me we have a larger crop than we ever had before. Our trees are fairly breaking down with them, and it will be quite a problem as to what to do with the crop here this fall. I think a good solu - tion of the question would be acceptable to most of the apple growers and it seems to me that something as Mr. Christy has suggested about an association being formed would help in the matter. I think the grower would be benefited as much as the shipper. RIDGE VS. LEVEL CULTURE FOR SWEET POTATOES. PROF. E. A. EMERSON. A topic like this may seem out of place at a horticultural meeting, but horticulture includes vegetables and there is just as much need to impress upon the farmers that they must use judgment in vegetable growing as in fruit growing. There is a great difference of opinion among gardeners con - cerning the relative value of ridge and level culture for sweet potatoes, many maintaing that the plants must be set on ridp's. others that they should be set on the level just as other plants are. As is usual in such cases, both are partly right and both are partly wrong. Sweet potatoes are essentially a warm weather crop. They is not take kindly to cold, damp soils. This fact has led to the </seg>
            <seg id="p246">249 ■ practice of throwing up ridges of soil upon which the plants are set. Ridge soil warms up quicker in spring than level ground and does not become so excessively wet and cold in periods of prolonged rainy weather. It is natural, therefore, that ridge cul - ture should he used in moist climates. In many parts of our state, however, there is less danger from too cold, damp soil than from too hot. dry soil; hence level culture of sweet jMitatoes is often substituted here for the ridge method so common in other places. There is no doubt that soil moisture is conserved by level culture since less surface is exposed to the drying action of the sun and wind. It is to be expected, therefore, that level culture would be better adapted to our climatic conditions, as a rule, than ridge culture. This is esjiecially true on our upland soils. And yet even on our high, dry lands and in the driest seasons, we see sweet potatoes planted on high ridges, presumably l&gt;ecause that is the way they are grown "back East." That the true purp&lt;&gt; - ridges is really known was well illustrated in a Lincoln market garden last summer. The main part of the garden was high and well drained but at one end the land was low or at least poorly drained. The gardener set his sweet potato plants on the natural level of the garden until he came to the poorly drained part where he prepared ridges for his plants. That level culture is best adapted to dry conditions and ridge culture to wet conditions, was well shown at the Experiment Station last summer 1 1901). A block of sweet potatoes was di - vided into two equal parts, in one of which the plants were given ridge culture and in the other level culture. One-half of each part was irrigated and the other half left unirrigated. All four of these parts were given careful, clean cultivation.

Douglas — I would like to ask Mr. Emerson if he knov a good plan to take care of small tubers for seed. It is quite a bother to send off for seed and I have had bushels that were just right for seed, not exactly the right size for market, but it has been a question how to save the seed. I have not succeeded and if you know of a plan by which the seed can be kept over it will be desirable information. Professor Emebson — I have never kept seed over. I have it kept. I have, seem, for instance, sweet potatoes kept in the boiler-room of a greenhouse in Lincoln, where it was dry. They were placed on shelves not more than one or two layers deep. They shriveled more or less. I don't know what the temperature was, but it was quite high. It is commonly said that sweet pota - toes must be kept at a higher temperature than other things. You must be careful not to ventilate when the outside air is warmer than the inside for if you do the warm air coming in will cause moisture to be deposited upon the cool tubers. While peopl* it is necessary to ventilate, they ventilate when it is colder outside and warm the air up by artificial means. Mr. Barnard — We don"t have any trouble keeping them. They are the easiest things in the world to keep. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">253 REMARKS BT MR. SILAS WILSON. Mr. Douglas — We wrap the table sized potatoes in paper. Mr. Lornsdorf — I have no trouble at all. I park them in bar - rels. I don't raise a very large crop. I put up a barrel or two and wrap each potato by itself in paper and pack it away and put them where the temperature will remain reasonably i You can change them from one teni[&gt;erature to another if wrapped in paper. The change don't affect them and they will come out all right. I would not plant a wilted potato and expect to r. They will grow as other potatoes. It doesn't seem to affect the quality of the potato for rooking. They will bring a 1. amount of plants if you cut them lengthwise and you cannot rot them. They will lie there until the next fall. I have had them in September. They won't stand freezing and they wont stand a temperature approximating freezing — not within 40 or some thing like that, 8° or 10° above freezing. * / Mr. Dole— I find that from 40° to M is all right on sin or in boxes, if there are not too many in a box. Sixty to ninety degrees they will wither. We have tried both ways. We keep them in the greenhouse and they do the l»est yet in contact with the boiler heat. I think the place in Lincoln there is an inch board wall between the boiler-room and their room. They are kept on shelves. That* room is l&gt;etween the boiler-room and the greenhouse and the temperature is from 40° to f&gt;0° and at times perhaps lower than 40°. That temperature, if dry. keeps them all right. We sometimes throw a little sawdust around then to keep the dampness out. REMARKS UY MR. SILAS WILSON. President L. M.

You are friends to my friends. I am a great friend of the birds. I believe that Professor Hruner said some things last night you ought to go home and put into practcice. all of you. and that is. about this imaginary destruction of fruit by the birds. It is largely imaginary and largely brought al&gt;out by conditions that may exist on your place. I live in a town where we have an abundance of birds. At four o'clock in the morning they make the air ring and we are not troubled any with the birds eating our fruit. I believe Professor limner struck the key note when ho ■aid. "&lt;;ive the birds plenty of fresh water and you won't lie dis - turbed." It has been my experience for thirty years, when birds have an abundance of fresh water they don't disturb the fruit. The birds are swarming on our place and out on my fruit farm two miles from town I have running water there all the time and the same conditions apply there as in town. Where the birth have plenty of water and occasionally a few mull&gt;erries, our fruit is not disturbed, and I believe, as Professor Rruner said last night, the birds are truly our friends. I believe that many of you would lx - astonished if you would study the subject, as he says. Almost all of the birds are fed upon insects. &lt;Jive them plenty of water and plenty of insects and occasionally some fruit and you are all right and you are the gainer by being friendly to the birds. I think this is a question that ought to be taught in our schools. The boys and girls will soon be the men and women and they are the ones to impress with these ideas and these truths that we believe will prove beneficial.

Furnas — The duty of fruit growers is to know who are their friends in the way of insects and birds. The large Hies have smaller flies on them and the smaller flies have lesser Hits on them and so on ad finan. That means there is a continuation of preservers and destroyers that equalize themselves to a certain extent. The snake and toad are both great friends of the farmer in every respect. They are our greatest insect destroyers. In France snakes and toads are raised and sold to the gardeners ainl so with insects and birds. I try to divide with the birds. I am willing to divide up with them. Mr. Wilson spoke of the Russian mulberry. I have them planted over my place to feed the birds and I have succeeded in providing to a great extent for the birds. The Baltimore oriole I have not been able to provide for, for he only takes one sip from one berry and sucks the juice out and then goes to the next berry and takes another sip and so on. I have never been able to provide for him. I don't allow any birds killed on my place. I think it is important that we understand who and what are our friends and not destroy them, at mi.v rale. I don't want to keep snakes in my pockets, but I let them run about the premises and destroy all they can. This fruit growing has become latterly more of a question than it ever was before and the price of success is eternal rigilance. We are affected with so many ills we must be watchful from </seg>

You cannot plant an apple tree now and let it take care of itself until it bears fruit, but you must cultivate it and study it. All the people who are obtaining subsistence from the soil, wherever it may be, must study everything conn, with their vocation. People are becoming more and more inter - ested in the scientific prosecution of agriculture and it behooves the farmer and tiller of the soil to elevate himself as much as anyone else.

DISEASES OF LARGE GREENHOUSE PLANTS. LAURA E. WOODFORD, KNOWLESVILLE, N. Y. This paper must needs be only a catalogue of the diseases which affect the different plants, since only little work has been done in the investigation of these fungi, and still less has l&gt;een written. I. Perhaps we are most interested in the palms of all the large greenhouse plants, and we will first give our attention to the fungi which attack the various species of these plants. Graphiola pfuenicis. — This is parasitic on the leaves of the palm in Italy, and other Mediterranean countries, and also in hot - houses elsewhere. It is quite prevalent in the University green - house and its little, light yellow, volcano-like structures injure the appearance of the leaf greatly. The sporocarps make their appearance as little black protuberances on both sides of the leaf. The close hyphal tissue, formed by the mycelium, causes deforma - tion, for it encloses and kills the parenchyma, displaces bundles of schlerenchymatous sells, and ruptures epidermis and hypoderm. These sporocarps consist of a two-layered peridium. the outer a sporogenous layer forming the outer layer of the black protuber - ances on the leaves, the inner a delicate tuft of sterile hairs. The sporogenous hyphaj originate from the center of the underlying </seg>
            <seg id="p255">258 hyphal tissue, and form a palisade-like layer in the bottom of the Bporocarp cavity, the remaining space being filled with spores and tufts of barren hyphsp. These latter hyplue rise among the sporogenous ones, and project as a fine brush like tuft out of the ruptured peridiuni. The sporogenous hyplne grow vertically up wards, and become septate, forming chains of loosely connected. roundish cells or joints. The terminal joints give off spherical eells laterally, and die away leaving the cells loose in the sporo carp cavity. From the division of these spherical cells, yellow spores arise, and upon rupture of the peridinra, are carried out oa the tufts of the sterile hyphsp to be scattered by the wind. Tubeuf and Smith assert that the sjiores germinate and produce either conidia or promycelium, but I have not been successful in ger - minating them in water as yet. Pestalozziu phatiicin produces a leaf spot disease on indoor cultivated palms. The fungus forms spindle-shajted conidia, with two or more brown median cells and hyaline terminal cells, the one at the free end carrying several ciliate proem Telephora laciniata. — This fungus produces a disease called "Stem Rot." caused by the fruiting threads of the shelf-fungus. Since palms are kept damp, it is very favorable for fungus to gH started and thrive, producing a rot of the bases of the leaves and finally the stems. However, according to Tul&gt;euf and Smith, the fungus so envelops young trees with its sporophores that sun"o&lt; a tion follows. This disease is not found in the university green house. CoUctotricfuuH kcttt'ur. — This is another fungus, not found at tacking the palms in this greenhouse, for it only affects the seed lings, preventing their leaves from unfolding. It forms conidieal patches surrounded by setae. II. Tubeuf and Smith catalogue five fungi which attack ferns. Sphaeirllu poJfpMNL — This fungus produces a leaf spot on the living leaves of sjK'cies of the several genera. I'oli/podiuni. .1* pidium, Atfimimm, and Ptcris. The delicate perithecia are im - bedded in the tissue of the host plant and contain asci with two - celled colorless spores, but no paraphyses are present. </seg>

Taphrimi. — Several species of this fungus form advent i' buds on the leaves of several varieties of ferns of different coun tries, but the ferns in the greenhouse are not mentioned as l&gt;eing affected. These buds develop into structures resembling a "witch's broom." The asci are of the general tyi&gt;e. slender, club shaped, tapering to both ends, with a roundish a|&gt;ex. and gr&lt; breadth being in the upper quarter of the ascus.

In this fungus, the apothecia break out from the substratum as black crusts. The asci contain eight oval, unicellular, colorless spores, and the paraphyses are thread - like and septate. III. The fig tree, hicitx, seems to l&gt;e singularly free from fungus diseases, however three fungi are mentioned by Tulteuf and Smith as attacking Fhux, though none of these occur on the fig tree, subject to greenhouse conditions.

"Tin- sports form a much branched, compact sporogenous mycelium with mem branes. which ;it first swell up in a gelatinous manner within the fruit tissue. Spores ;m&gt; formed inside the ultimate ramifications of the mycelium, and as they reach maturity the membrane loaea its gelatinous character, the cells break up, and the spores arc set free. They are dispersed as a dry dusty powder after the rup ture of the fruit tissue enclosing them. The spores germinate. and give rise to a promycelium. which becomes divided up by means of cross-septa* into several cells, from each of which coni dia are laterally abjointed. These conidia sprout yeast like and give ofl new conidia. or they produce a mycelium: the former is the case when nutrition is abundant, as when under artificial cut tivation. the latter under less favorable nutrition. In very un - suitable conditions, the constituent cells of the promyceliuni mav each develop directly into hypluv capable of infecting a new host.' poro bolleana is a fungus with conidia elongated, slender, septate, and olive green in color, and its mycelium is also greenish. It produces olive brown spots on the leaves and fruits of the tig tree, causing much injury to the crop. fici is simply mentioned as occurring on F'uux cmricm in Italy and the United States. IV. Though the lemon tree is usually grown in open tropical countries, we sometimes find it in the greenhouse of the North. Hence we will now consider the various fungi which attack this tree as tabulated by Tubeuf and Smith. luxuriant or Ftutisporium leinonis. — This fungus is considered by Hriosi to be the cause of "inal-di-goiniuu" of the lemon trees in Italy and other countries. To quote: "The sporodochium is more or less effused. The conidia are spindle-shaped or sickle like, and pluricellular when mature. The conidiophores are branched and give off the conidia from their apex. In Florida the damage done is great and much more serious than that caused by any other disease of the same plants. The characteristic of this disease is the exudation of gum from patches near the </seg>
            <seg id="p258">261 of the tree. These patches enlarge and the disease spreads round the trunk and downward into the roots, passing inwards from bark to cambium and wood, killing the tkme as it goes. Other symptoms are sparse foliage, small yellowish h &lt;l death of the smaller branches over the tree. The most effective I ment is to remove the soil around the crown roots In using of water. The diseased hark should also tx&gt; cut away and the wounds painted over with carbolic acid or sulphur wash. I drainage to promote root aeration and avoidance of the use of nitrogenous manures are also recommended." Pestalozzia gurpini. — The conidia formed by this fungus form large spots with dark margins on the living leaves. The epi - dermis contains the spore patches, from which conidia. embedded in a mucilaginous slime, are given off. The conidia co three dark median and two hyaline terminal cells, the distal one bearing the characteristic appendages. The leaves are perm* with mycelium threads and fall prematurely. Colletotrichum nduxtum. — This fungus forms conidial pal surrounded by seta\ causing a leaf spot. Faded spots appear on the leaves, becoming later greyish brown dotted over with minute black conidial patches. Sph&amp;relia gibelliana. — This fungus is found on the living leaves of the lemon tree. The delicate perithecia. etnlM'dded in the leaf tissue, contain asci with two-celled eotottai but no paraphyses are present. PJeospora fiesperideanim. — The black perithecia. produced by this fungus, are not developed in a stronia. but are at first cealed in the host tissues only they contain asci having eight multiseptate colored spores, and paraphyses also. The conidial form appears as a black coating on the fruit. Dendrophoma valsisporn. — According to Penzig. this funcns occurs on the living leaves of the lemon. Tt has picnidia similar to Phoma, but its conidiaphores bear several conidia either on branches or little processes. Cladosporium elegann. — This fungus occurs rarely on the lemon tree. The mycelium is greenish, the conidia globe* </seg>
            <seg id="p259">262 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ovoid, one- to four-celled, and of variable form. It can* "scab" which is injurious. The disease first takes the form of whitish or cream colored spots on the leaves, young twip - fruit. As the spots multiply, the leaves beeoaM badly curled or twisted and covered with wart-like eruptions. Tubeuf and Smith merely mention four other fungi affecting the lemon, ifcliola and Vnpnodium producing sooty coating mould, and Penicilium and Rporuiesmiuin. the latter. I think. affects the roots of the tree. V. No fungus is catalogued by Tubeuf and Smith as attackini: the india-rubber plant, and the cacti are also singularly free from fungus diseases. VI. Phiftophthora otnnirora is the only fungus catalogued which affects the cactus. This sometimes attacks and kills tlie seedlings of the cactus. The mycelium grows both between and through the host cells, and are at first non-septate, though much branched. "The conidiophores branch and produce a large num - ber of conidia or sporangia in succession. The first conidia are terminal, but are displaced towards one side and thrown off by further growth of the conidiophore to produce other conidia. The sporangia distribute their contents as swarming cells with lateral cilia ; the conidia produce a hyplue directly. The cells are developed one in each oogonium. and are fertilized by an antheridium. The spherical oospores germinate in the spring by means of a germ-tube. Since little investigation has been made along the patholog line in the case of the large greenhouse plants, few w»j treatment are known. But as these large greenhouse plain - coming to have a more and more economical important •&lt; indeed they are. especially palms, investigation will in&lt; ; and preventive measures will be discovered. Spraying and wash - ing are the most effective measures in the way of prevention and cure. For many diseases washing with soap is useful, and this is to be recommended especially in case of palms grown in private houses. Use a pure white soap that is not too strong with alkali. </seg>

ASTERS. Wilt or Stan Hot. — This is perhaps the most common and de - structive disease of the aster. It first appears soon after the plants are set out into the bed. and while prevalent throughout the season, is most noticeable at the time of setting the plants. and at the time of blossoming. At the surface of the ground the stem is badly rotted, though this is a final stage of the disease. The effects of the di&gt; seen first on one side, usually in one of the lower leaves and al most always in one half of the leaf. The normal color turns a dull yellowish green and soon becomes apparent along the whole length of the plant, but still on one side, causing a "wilting, fad - ing, blighting effect." Some plants perish before flowering, or a few feeble flowers may form before the plant dies, or the plant ma y seem normal, form a normal crop of flowers, and suddenly show the characteristic blight and die in a short time. If the stem hi open at the surface of the ground, at an early stage of the disease. a dark discoloration will be found just outside of the inner v tissue. This spot extends around and up the stem, affecting the outer cortex, rotting it and leaving the wood intact. If thin sec - tions are made through the discolored spot, in the early rti the large water-carrying vessels are found to contain a fungus growth. This growth increases, gradually filling the vessels, till they are entirely plugged up. Since the watercourses are thus clogged, the plant gradually wilts. The disease is thus due to the cutting off of the water supply and food supply from the roots and not from directly injurious effects of the fungus. "The disease is contracted in the seed bed as a result of con - ditions which favor damping off." Comparisons made bet\ plants started in the greenhouse which damped off more or less, and those started in the open ground show that in every case </seg>
            <seg id="p261">264 NEBRASKA STATE HoUTH'l'I/ri'KAI. where the plants died from stem rot after being set out in tin - bed, "the disease came from the seed bed and was not contr;i&lt;te&lt;l by healthy plants after being set out in the field." Plants mown in the greenhouse are infected from spores of the fungus present in the soil or in the greenhouse. This disease is caused by :i species of Fusarium. The species seems to have little tendency toward spore formation. Young infested plants placed in ;i moist chamber arc soon covered with a white mycelium from which lunulate Fusarium conidia develop in abundance. The formation of such conidia was never observed upon affected plants in any stage of the disease. Cultures, from affected tissue. on potato and prune juice, give mostly a white sterile mycelium with occasionally a few conidia. Infection takes place in seedlings started in earth in which affected tissue has been buried. Tn a badly infested house plants started in sterilized earth were as badly infected and by the same fungus. Observations have left no doubt that the dN ib contracted in the seed bed and plants which are healthy when set out in permanent beds are immune, even in infested soil. No inoculations were made by the author of the paper, of the Fusarium upon healthy plants, nor was the species isolate.! and named. Yelloir Disease or Blight. — Another disease considered in the same bulletin as the Aster Wilt is called by the author the Yel low Disease. He says the disease is obscure, not being caused by a fungus, insect, or other organism, nor is it due to any apparent effect of treatment or environment. Mr. Sheldon, of the State University, who has observed and worked on the disease some what, says the Yellow Disease is an accompaniment of the Wilt and is due to the same fungus growth. The general effect is a bright yellow spindling growth. The affected parts do not die. but simply show the peculiar growth which prevent their proper development. The trouble begins to appear after the plants have become well established in a per manent bed. At the summit, or growing tip. a light greenish yellow color appears.

Blodgett) going so far as to advocate the spread ing of the Darluca as much as possible, by the inoculation of spores on plants affected by the rust. Mr. Sheldon, of the State University, who has worked quite extensively on this fungus and on the rust, says that Darluca finds entrance to the leaf through the ruptures of the epidermis caused by the rust. At the first Darluca seems to be somewhat parasitic on the rust but later leaves the rust and becomes parasitic upon the leaf itself. At </seg>

It is most serious in the "cutting bench." If present even in small quantities in the slips it may, under favorable conditions, grow rapidly and cause decay. Ustilago riolaccu ( Pers. I.

Rust. — The plant when badly infected becomes dwarfed, the leaves are small and brown upon the under side. Later the plants appear as small, stiff, nearly leafless stems, ending in stunted heads that fail to open into marketable flowers. On the under surface of the leaves the brown spots are slightly raised, forming pustules which contain the spores. In advanced stages the le are completely killed. The rust is due to a fungus which Halstead states is probably Puccinia hieracii Mart., though he did not fully determine this. Stone reports a rust, quite common on chrysanthemums in Massachusetts, as closely resembling and probably identical with Puccinia tanaceti S. I Puccinia hclianthi D. C). CHRYSANTHEMUMS. </seg>

Perithecia of an Ascomycete found in the tissues of the inf&lt; leaves at the same time. Cultures were made and in agar tuln-s it was "proved conclusively that the same filaments bore Alter naria spores, and the perithecia-bearing spores identical with those found in the leaf." It may be true that the Alternaria form is most prominent in the summer, but "the sac condition i suined near the end of the season and in this the fungus remains during the winter." On the leaf the perithecia were quite uni - formly spherical. In agar the perithecia vary greatly in size and shape, composite and fantastic shapes being assumed. Anthracno8e. — Found in the steins of fully grown plants, but most common in the propagating beds where cuttings an It appears as dark specks on the affected parts but the filaments are sent throughout the tissues of the stem, particularly that part of the cutting which is near the surface of the ground. </seg>

Goodyera repens. etc.. possess roots developed as eadotrophfa mycorhiza. The fungus penetrates into the cells of the cortex forming a ball or coil of hyphae. The fungus n&gt; covers the roots externally nor inhabits the epidermal cell - root hairs are produced normally. The hyphal cells be emptied and only the remains of the walls are left in the living roots. Frank therefore concludes that the fungus being nourished for a time by the root cells, is finally depv of its contents by them. He calls these roots ''fungus traps" and the plants possessing them "fungus digesting plants." The fungus grows onward from the older parts of the ro&lt;&gt;' the younger, so the contents of the older hyphae may pass imta younger hyphae. The advantage of reabsorption of food by the roots, which they have previously furnished to the fungus, has not been closely investigated nor has the question whether the roots are able to nourish the plants equally well without fungi. Pfeffer suggested that the reduced formation of hair - roots of Orchidcae was due to the fungus hyphae bdMTiag physiologically as root hairs. Endotrophic niycorhiza are pi in saprophytic green orchids as well as in hemi saproph\ ti&lt; - orchids without green color. Memeke found hyphae pan through the little cells of the endodermis of the aerial n&gt;&lt;&gt; orchids into the mucilage mass of the rind parenchyma.

This fungus therefore does not bring about a diseased con dition, but it does destroy the beauty of the flowers. Leaf Spots. — (PkyUottietm viohie Dtmm.; PWtwpof vMme Sacc). — These two fungi cause leaf spots not easily distinguished by the unaided eye. The spots are circular in shape and white in color. The spots may run together and the whole leaf iM'come in volved in a general decay. The white spots usually have dark spots on them which are thickest near the center and form a smaller black spot in the center of the white spot. (The black spots are due to numerous spores bearing filaments, i As the i enlarge they become yellowish.

It attacks violets out of doors most severely during continued damp weather. It may or may not be accompanied by a leaf spot ( Phyllosticta violae). On the roots great numbers of dark spots are found, usually involving the whole substance of the root for a distance of a few mm. Sections through the spots show the tissues more or less blackened and destroyed, and lying in the cells, in greater or less numbers, peculiar looking squarish brown bodies sometimes tilling the cells completely and looking not unlike some form of smut. These squarish bodies are the result of the breaking up of large cylindrical 2-5 (or more) septate brown spores formed from a rather scanty septate mycelium which apparently causes the death of the root cells at the affected points. The fungus is un - doubtedly the form described by Zopf (l^TGi under the name TKieUwia basicola.
