I doubt very much, when the whole State is turning out to the reception, that we can secure a very large attendance, and I present the matter for your consideration. The speakers are all willing to come at some hour, like 4:30 p. m. if the exhibitors could get there, or they will be there for Thursday KThe Commercial Club has given us the same room that we had hereto - and the program is all arranged, and the gentlemen selected to speak that some other time be selected.

The idea of holding conventions and publishing the proceedings, is also growing among other associations. Some ten or twelve state associations have written me during the past year to secure copies of our Articles of Incorporation, and of copies of our proceed - ings in annual meetings. The last year has been a busy one in the office of the Secretary. Corres - pondence is constantly growing, and all of our correspondents were treated with courtesy. The Board has attended to all matters assigned it, not hold - ing unnecessary meetings. The delay in publishing the premium list, per - haps, prevented a few exhibitors from being present. This delay was caused by the attempt to put advertisements in the list, and the misunderstanding as to who was to have charge of the same. The forms were held for three weeks in order to secure a few copies for i. The matter of ad - vertising was attempted in order to help reduce expenses of the Association. We printed five hundred copies more than ever l&gt;efore and have compara - tively few, if any, left. In fact, had we but printed the usual number, we would not have been able to supply the demand made upon the Secretary by at least two hundred copies. The past year has been the heaviest in the history of the Association The correspondence totalizes, as follows: Copies of Annual Reports mailed . 800 Copies of Poultry Premium Lists mailed 1246 Letters written 1185 The trust which was committed to me, as your Secretary one year ago, is herewith returned to you with my sincere thanks for all courtesies that have been extended.

There is an item or two of entry fees that have not jet been adjusted, which will increase the receipts three or four dollars more. The President: LWhat shall we do with the reports of the officers? r. Irvin: I move that the reports of the Secretary and Treasurer, be received and placed on file. The motion was adopted. The President: UAre there any reports of Special or other committees? Secretary: None. Communications and Correspondence? The Secretary: There are none, except that I have received a communication since our first meeting from Mr. Thompson offering to judge our next Show for forty dollars. The President UIs there any new business that anyone has to present? e Secretary. I do not know whether I have any new business other than that which was presented at the last meeting, and that was the list of judges for the next year's Show. I will say that these propositions came at the Utgg of the Board believing that it would be for the advantage of the Association to secure propositions from many of the judges in advance of this meeting, so that the new Board could pick out and settle the matter of judges for the next year's Show tomorrow, or at this meeting if you see fit. The President: 1 the exhibitors of the diffierent classes take up the matter with the Board; that they indicate to the Board the individual he or she would like to have to be the judge of that class at our next show, so that the new Board will then have something to govern them in selecting Judges, rlowever, I leave it for your action.

Shrader: I would like to inquire the object of giving smaller premium for White Holland Turkeys, than to the other? Mr. Ludden: iThat is simply a mistake of the printer. He ha I corrected to "6", and he corrected it to "2". I corrected the proof and sent it back id he then made a mistake in correcting my second copy. The premium ill be paid as formerly, because the report of the Board stands and, not the i stake of the Printer? We will pay what the Board made it, and not what e printer made it.

The Secretary N'he program arranged for tonight was placed in the hands of your tary by the Board and realizing the interest that the fanciers and ex - &gt;rs had in the Show room, we arranged only the speaking part of the am for one evening, and that had to be modified a little on account of rception to Mr. Thompson, as heretofore stated: The President: We will now listen to a paper by Wm.

            <seg id="p014">14 NEBRASKA STATK POILTRY ASSOCI ATloJ? Value of Capons and Caponizing." Mr. Unit comes to us from United States Experiment Station. M.CE OF CAPONS AND CAPONIZING Mr. Unit spoke, as follows Ladies and Gentlemen, and Members of the Nebraska State Poultry Association : A capon bears the same relation to a cockerel that a steer does to a bul it is a castrated rooster. But a capon is more quiet, lays on much flesh am fat, and rei; r many months. They will weigh from 60 to 7 per cent more than a rooster of the same age, and in many eastern market will bring from 20 to 30 cents per pound. The comb and wattles do no grow after the operation, if done before they become very prominent, but i s ime cases, it is the practice to cut them off. The feathers of the neck an saddle grow very long and glossy. A capon does not care for the hens no crow nor fight, but will make the finest of mothers for chickens. If, i the operation you do not succeed in removing all of the testicle, it will, i course of time, develop into a very large size and will be found to contai water. Such a bird is known as a "slip." F. L. Washburn, in the Orego Bulletin N&lt; A slip gains flesh and fat and better flesh than rooster; but in three or tour months after the operation, the comb and wa ties grow, the bird develops a crow and chases the hens worse than cockerel. ! to kill such my, a they are a great bother on a j&gt; s they will brin as much money as a capon of the same weight, but if a peraoe ing the operation, there will be n&gt; -it upon the market tit has li. al. Is the operation iruel? It is no 1 :1 than performing the same kind of an operation upon pi es. It does not take long to perform the oper the bird wi in to eat directly after being released from the caponizing board. Id advise a person to operate upon a i&lt; iliar with the appearance and po A person ca any of the large breeds and secure some very nice capons. The you wish to caponize should be fasted from 24 to 36 hours before tl •ation, aad should be fed very light the first day or two after th The operation as I have said before, is not difficult. The only difficult a person will have is in tearing open the lining between the two testicles, a this thin membrane contains arteries, and if you should rupture one of these your bird is gone, but he is just as good to eat as if you had beheaded him After the operation he should be put in a pen where there are no perches, a flying up to them will tear open the wound. The wound heals up in a fe days, and in some cases, there will be wind-puffs formed; that is, the air has got under the skin, and when you notice this all that is necessary will be t puncture it with a large needle and let the air out. The birds are general all right to run with the flock within three days after the operation. Ore e»re must be taken not to let any dirt, bits, or feathers fall into the cavit </seg>
            <seg id="p015">XEBS vTtoS 15 The sunlight is a great help in performing this kind of an operation. The incision is made between the first and second rib from the hip, and great care should be taken not to go too near the back bone. E)oes it pay to raise capons? Any person who has had any experience them will acknowledge that it pays well to raise capons. If a farme :ed why he does not raise them, he generally answers that he canno s not nerve enough to caponize. Such persons should follow th e of a lady who once wrote for W. H. V patent set and in tions which are as follows: "Dear Sir:— After receiving your paten read the instructions over several times, and then operated upon fou cockerels I then tried to cut a live one but could not. I took u cnife and laid it down several times, and at last my ner\ ie and I made my first incision upon the live cockerel. The following tw I caponized one hundred and twenty cockeri it three, be - attending to my other work." According to Mr this lady would have the one hundred and twenty cockerels, we' r pounds each, or 4X0 poun old, and sell them at 13c per pound each, which would net her $62.4 if they were &gt;uld weigh six pounds each, or 720 pounds ind woui per pounds, $129. 60. By th: n see th er 100X profit over the cockerel Mr. V 1 relates the fol I - without losing one. They did well Eio, capon H &gt; ' them to .1.1 er pound, or $ : ted hi lit but without deducting expense: Having related the experience of others, I will nm nmer and lost but two. I had never per this work myself , but ha it done while attendir. school last year, and decided ti. work at home the following mer. At the present time I have but ten of them left as four of them were killed last fall. The capons average seven pounds each and I was offered 13c per pound for them which would net me {9.10. Now, If I had sold them as young roosters, they would have weighed but four pounds each and sold it 7c per pound. now, you can see that it pays to raise capons. I kept out one rooster from the flock of the capons to use as comparis. weighs but little over four pounds. He has the same feed and care, bat is not as quiet as the capons I will now give you a few of the principal points how to caponize and when 1 . They should be aboat ten weeks old 2. They should be fasted long enough so they will be empty, for ia that way you will have ho trouble in fiuding the testi. lim $43.75. These same birds it not cap aid have « n pou; </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 3. It will be found most convenient to make the incision between the rst and second rib from the hip. Do not make it between the third and ourth rib, for yon are sure to strike the lung cavity. Be careful not to go oo near the back bone for fear you might rupture a bloodvessel or puncture other organs. Take plenty of pains in finding the second testicle. — The op - ration of caponizing is neither dangerous nor difficult, and does not take ong to perform it, and if these precautions are taken into consideration will, no doubt, have good success. (Applause) The Secretary: text speaker is Doctor S. Stewart, of Kansas City, Mo., but the ntleman is not in the room at present. Mr. Lewelling: move you, Mr. Chairman, that we proceed with the election of officers the ensuing yenr. Motion adopted. Mr Ludden: bThe President has made me his spokesman for this evening, and in the ination of officers he requests me to nominate for President of this •ciation for the ensuing year, the Honorable T. L. Norval, of Seward. The election is to be by ballot. Mr. Lewelling: I move that the rules be suspended and that the Secretary be instructed to cast the vote of the Association for the Honorable T. L. Norval for President. The motion was seconded by Mr. Lemon and adopted unanimously Mr. Ludden: The ballot is cast aa ordered by the Association, 125 votes for T. L Norval. Mr. Norval: I highly appreciate the compliment that you have paid me. I have on previous occasions said that I did not desire any office in the and I think I have repeated the same thing to almost every memlier who has been to me upon the subject today, and the day previous. I now repeat that I think you ought to have selected as your President, Mr. Osterhout. The success of this Show has very largely depended upon him and that of the Secretary, and I feel that Mr. Osterhfmt ought to have been placed in the position again. I think it would have been more complimentary that it should have gone to him than it should be tendered to anyone else, or, at least, before. If it is the desire of the Association that I should serve, I will en - deavor to do the best I can. I should have been pleased if Mr. Osterhout, or some other member of thr Association had been selected, because I fear that my other duties will interfere and prevent me from serving as 1 - like.

I know I tried not to have correspondence lag an ir. Every letter I have received that could be an .vere* the day I received it. II want to thank the members here tonight for the confidence, forbear ! and patience they have manifested with me in the transaction of the •eciallv during the work of this show room, and in and about the •etarv's room. It is not an easy place to take care of the score cards records and answer all inquiries at the same time, and keep you: ;t and smiling as you mi^ht under more favorable conditions, or as yon Id be if you were talkiiu tve been indifferen 11 y time it has been because I hid many things to think about, and some y else would put in a question just at the time that you wanted ,ver. Ordinarily I can answer questions and sign my name and do ething else at the same time, but I cannot always answer half dozen per &gt; all at the same time. tl wish to thank you for your confidence that you have shown in me an&lt; work by the hamdsome vote you have given me in electing me anothe • &gt;ur Secretary. I am very anxious to make next year a good dea er than this show has been. The work is being systematized in a man that was never done before, and especially in the matter of a mailin and for li- g people in our Show. During the year t </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 &gt;*EBR I'Oi'l.Tm (TliiX come I shall list everybody who may be interested in poultry in our stat and in the territory immediately adjacent to Nebraska. I have started wh is known as a mailing list on the card index system, putting on a list, ■ that want premium lists, or a copy of our Annual Report. This has bee the cause of such large amounts to be expended or postage. I do not kno whether the Association will stand it or not. If you do not want it done want you to say so, toinstruct me otherwise but it is not a business way. Whe people write for premium lists, if you have no mailing list, you do not kno whether you sent any or not. Then, again some other parties may recei two or three copies, all on the account of lack of a mailing list. My ste ographer at the desk, just as soon as a letter come in requesting a premiu or an Annual Report, addresses a wrapper and puts the name on the m.ii ing list. These wrappers may be written three or four weeks in advance o the printing, but in an hour's time after we receive the first five hundre&lt; copies, they were in the mail. That is the same plan, unless the Association desires differently, that I purpose to continue for the ensuing year. I believe it j an Associa - tion to place ourselves before the people, and certainly the premium lists and Annual Reports sent out can do us no harm, and they bring good results in the exhibition. That is what we want. We are after new business, new members. Since we have been incorporated we have more than doubled the poultry products of Nebraska. The statistics will show almost three times as much money now coming into Nebraska each year And I want us to go right on until we can say four times as much. There is another matter that I might speak of and that is the re] that exists between the State Poultry Association and the County and Dis - aions. They all help to enthuse and inspire in this matter, and the po^ ;hat are before us in Nebraska are brightening every dav. i good sort of rivalry, and I hope it will keep on increasing. Of course, we must see to it that we are not outstripped in the class in which we are interested. I thank you for the courtesies and confidence manifested in tin given me tonight. ( Applause) Election of Treasurer. tMr. E. E. Smith placed in nomination the present incumbent, Mr. I. L lan, for treasurer. The nomination was seconded by Mr. Clary. Clary: t There being but one nomination before the Association, I move that the i be suspended and that the Secretary be instructed to cast the entire of the Association in favor of Mr. I. L.
