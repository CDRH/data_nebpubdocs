            <seg id="p007">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT EXPERIMENTAL WORK The work of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station for the current year has been as follows : I The funds for the Station are secured from three sources, nely: The Adams and the Hatch appropriations are received m the Federal Government in amounts shown by the financial tement of this report. The Experiment Station also uses tain other funds appropriated from general University main - ance and set aside by the Regents at their annual meeting for maintenance of departments in the College of Agriculture I the Experiment Station. Direct appropriations are also le by the Legislature for certain specific purposes, such as cholera investigation and the work of the State Entomologist I State Botanist, who are respectively Entomologist and :anist of the Experiment Station. These appropriations are ler control of the Regents of the University and are expended the purposes authorized by the Legislature. The State makes direct appropriations also for the mainte - nance of Substations at North Platte, Valentine, Mitchell, and Cnlbertson, Nebraska. An appropriation is also made for Agri - cultural Extension work of the Experiment Station and the College of Agriculture. The farm of the Nebraska School of Agriculture at Curtis is available for experimental and demon - stration purposes. t Under the law, the Adams funds must be expended strictly original research and cannot be used for general administra - i, for printing, or for farm demonstrations. The Hatch ap - priation may be used for general administration purposes and investigation. It is no longer used to print bulletins of a &gt;ular or demonstration character. State funds which come u appropriation by the Regents to departments in the College Agriculture doing experimental work are available for par - es of investigation or demonstration, but these funds must </seg>

Tlic larger demands upon the departments o.insed V t!ie growth of flic Agricultural College leave less nnd ■ monev from State appropriations available for experimental purposes. I Plans of work are prepared by each department at the begin - g of the calendar year. covering the lines of investigation pro - ied for the current year. Plans are made for the utilization •II the funds available to the department, so that the work the Station may progress in a systematic and orderly manner icconiplish the largest results, and practically no funds remain ippropriated for the pursuance of new lines of work. Such ps of work can only be undertaken when the projects now iler investigation have been completed. Most lines of work itinne for a series of years before their final completion, oblems requiring original research are always pressing for estigation. but funds for taking up new lines of work have &gt;n so limited that very few new projects have been nnder - ;en in the last five years. LINES OF INVESTIGATION' I Plant Diseases. — The principal lines of investigation m* I on in Plant Pathology during the fiscal year were as fol - s: t. An attack upon certain t'uxnrhim diseases of the Irish to — particularly one called stem-end dry rot. 2. A comprehensive study of the leaf-curl, leaf-roll, rosette, nnd related diseases of the potato. The laboratory work involves anatomical and biochemical studies of the tuber. We expect to make a comparative study, organ for organ, of healthy and tvpical leaf-roll plants and tubers. Our work during the past two seasons seems to indicate the possibility of securing resist - ant strains of potatoes. An anatomical study of potato scabs, accompanied by cnl - f work to isolate the associated causal organisms. §1. Apple Canker. This is a new project undertaken during ■ year and has to do with Xumtnularia iii»creta as the cause the most serious blister canker of apples in eastern Nebraska. Son. Solution. — A study of the water soluble plant food in the soils of the loess region is in progress. It has been shown that the amount of plant food soluble in water is greatest in the soils which are most fertile as shown by their crop history. It has .ils.i bms shown that the amount of plant food recoverable </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 IPitrssic Ann i\ Soi:i;ihms and Kafirs. — A study of the con - ons under which prussic acid develops in soruhuins and irs is under way. This will include a study of the disappear - e of the prank acid when the plants are made into hay or ilage Eolok Dmumrm in Corn. — A study of the cheinic;il fac - eoneerned in the development and inheritance of color in in varieties of corn is in progress. I A preliminary paper on the Colloidal Behavior of Wheat ten is read? for publication. It has been shown that gluten i colloid and that the colloidal properties of gluten must be pii into account in any investigation of the bread-making lities of different Icon. The department plans in the near lire to carry out an extended investigation on the relation lie colloidal behavior of gluten to the bread-making qualities Hour. Special account will be taken of the effect of rarkme stances which are added in the bread-making process, on colloidal behavior of the gluten. t Wheat Investigation. — The average yield of the field plats ivintcr wheat for the year 101:! was J'.l Imshels j&gt;er acre. For iparison. the five best si rains and the five j&gt;oorest strains from selections of 1907 were planted on summer fallowed land. the yields were lost btCMM the unfavorable season produced rank a growth that all the wheat lodged and could not be rested separately. I Reports of yields from farmers upon three selected strains Turkey Red wheat distributed from the Station for purposes making comparative yields with local wheat give the follow - results: In 1911, 21 farmers in sixteen different counties w these varieties of wheat in direct comparison with local il. The average yield of local seed was 21.9 bushels per acre. I of the selected strains of seed 25.9 bushels per acre, making average of 1 Imshels in favor of the selected strains. In 1911. persons sowed this selected wheat in comparison with local il. the croji lieing harvested in 1912. as follows: </seg>

Corn — The climatic conditions for 1913 were so abnormal that no experimental data with corn were secured. Lack of moisture and hot, dry winds destroyed the crop except as it was nsed for forage. I Oats. — A study is being made of 720 lots of oats in an effort classify these under the proper variety names. This work now being duplicated at the Experiment Stations in Towa 1 New York, and a joint report will be issued in cooperation :h the Government. t Control ok Blister Canker in Apples. — Practical work in tion orchards to control blister canker of apples has been ctive by the removal of the affected parts and coating the mds with some material to protect and seal them against ;ction. Coal tar and asphaltum were among the most suc - sful covers, and carbolic acid and corrosive sublimate were cms the most successful disinfectants. Orchard Management. — In connection with orchard man - agement it has been shown that Bordeaux mixture is a more effective fungicide than lime-sulphur, especially when both apple scab and apple blotch are present. Bordeaux has, however, caused more injury to the fruit than has lime-sulphur except in the case of the first spraying, which is given before the blossoms Town Wheat No. Geneva Belmont Upland Fairfield Geneva .

            <seg id="p011">11 the first spraying (or cluster-bud spraying) and lime-sulphur for the three subsequent sprayings, except where the weather conditions become extremely dry and hot, in which case it is wise to substitute Bordeaux for the lime-sulphur in the fourth or July spraying. I The penetration method of spraying, that is, the application the material in coarse drops under very high pressure from Sordeaux nozzle, proved more effective as a control of the Iling moth than did the mist spraying, in so far as the second petal-fall spray was concerned. It was, however, found un - le to use the penetration spray method thruout the season. ce this method was only slightly more effective in controlling insects than was the treatment which consisted of penetra - a spray at the time the petals fall and of the mist »pray at other sprayings. The penetration spray caused very much re spray burn on the fruits. The percentages of sound fruit m the two methods were about 63 per cent of the penetration ay thruout and 81 per cent for the combination. tSEED Potatoes. — The work of the past four years indicates t it is possible to isolate from such a variety of potato as the •ly Ohio strains that are consistently better yielders than the inary run of the variety. Our tests also indicate that after aber strain has been isolated little advantage results from ther selection of high-yielding hills. Ilt is obvious that if potato growers are to improve their &gt;k by selection, they must be able to grow the same stock in i region year after year without the necessity of sending th for new seed. This has been found to be impossible in tin-astern Nebraska under ordinary methods of cultivation, growing a seed plat under a straw mulch it has been found Rihle to keep up the vigor of the stock indefinitely without necessity of bringing in new strains from the North. I Beef Production. — Experiments have been carried on to de - nine the relative values of different kinds of forage produced the farm in connection with different grain rations. Bix lots ?attle were fed upon the following rations: Lot 1. Torn, prairie hay, cold pressed cottonseed-cake. Lot 2. Corn, corn silage, cold pressed cottonseed-cake. Lot 3. Corn, corn silage, prairie hay. Lot 4. Corn, a heavy ration of corn silage, alfalfa hay. Lot 5. Corn, a light ration of corn silage, alfalfa hay. Lot 6. Corn, alfalfa hay. </seg>

While alfalfa makes the best showing in this experiment, this does not agree with other experi - ments carried on at the North Platte Station, where vounger cattle were fed. and this work is being duplicated (hiring the present winter at this Station before final results are published. Comparison of Soaked Wheat and Ground Whkat as a Ration fob Fattening Hogs. — On account of the high price of corn and the relatively low price of whe.it, an experiment m undertaken to determine the relative values of soaked wheat both with and without tankage and of ground wheat both with and without tankage, for fattening hogs. Four lots of hogs were used for this with the results valued at 7."&gt; cents indicated in the per bushel. tank- purpose following table.

The cost of the tankage increased the cost of gains 22 cents i&gt;er 1011 lbs. The most expensive gains were made upon the whole soaked wheat. No comparison with corn was made in this instance. Miik I'kodcitiox.— The Dairy Husbandry Department has in progress-- experiments to determine the relative values of the following rations in milk production: 1. The value of corn silage as compared with alfalfa hay. 2. Corn silage as compared with alfalfa silage. 3. Soiling crops versus corn silage as a supplement for summer pastures. This department is also gathering data with a view of de - termining the cost of milk production under Nebraska condi - tions. Hog Choi.kra Serum Production. — During the last year, the c;ip;i&lt;-it.v of the Serum Plant has hem increased about fourfold. During the year 101:? we produced ti.ti76.000 cubic centimeters of serum and a sufficient amount of virus to vaccinate 112,00(1 hogs weighing 150 pounds each by the Simultaneous method. The results from such vaccination were generally good, altho there were individual instances where unsatisfactory results were obtained. By an act of the Legislature, an appropriation of flo.000 to enlarge the plant and a subsidy of flo.000 additional to reduce the cost of serum to fanners was made available. Beginning July. 1913, the cost of serum was reduced to one cent per cubic centimeter, at which price it is now sold. The present capacity of the plant is 1.250.000 cubic centi - meters per month. This is five times the capacity of the plant one year ago. It is hoped that this plant will produce a suffi - cient amount of serum to meet the needs of the farmers in the future. Serum is sold for cash and is sent by express, C. O. D., upon application from farmers, but serum which has once been shipped and which is not used by the farmer cannot be returned to the plant, since exposure to unknown climatic conditions might affect the ]&gt;otency of the serum so that when again sent out to the trade it would produce unsatisfactory results. Every effort is made to produce serum of the highest quality, and it is </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Eeved that when this serum is used under favorable condi - is it will produce satisfactory results in immunizing hogs inst cholera and in stopping outbreaks which threaten a 1 or a community. COOPERATIVE EXPERIMENTS t Cooperative experiments are being carried on with 12 fanners methods of breeding corn for seed selection and with 14 fliers in testing soy beans under farm conditions. Cooperative •k is carried on with farmers in orchard management, includ - spraying and the treatment of orchards for disease. Coop- Mve work in feeding cattle is being carried on with Mr. W. Bowman of Beatrice, Nebr., and in feeding cattle and sheep h feeders in the North Platte vallev at Scottsbluff. EThru the Farm Demonstrators' work in the Agricultural ension service, cooperative work is carried on with fanners ive counties. THE NORTH PLATTE SUBSTATION I The work of the North TMatte Substation has been continued ag the lines of crop production, determination of the use of :er by crops, feeding experiments with calves in the produc - i of baby beef to determine the most satisfactory rations, and ling experiments with hogs to determine the most economical ibinations of alfalfa and grain in pork production. Experi - lts in tree growing are continued. Experiments are now lg undertaken to determine the cost of irrigation by pump - where the water must be lifted about 50 feet. Bulletins have a offered within the last year on "Growing Forest Trees in stern Nebraska." on "Feeding Baby Beef." on "The Storage Use of Soil Moisture." and a bulletin on crop production. Dairying. — An appropriation was made by the last Legisla - ture for the building of a dairy barn and the establishment of a dairy herd at the North Platte Substation. Pursuant to this act. plans have been drawn for a dairy barn, to be built of brick and concrete, which will house 40 dairy cows and additional young stock. The plans for this barn have been completed, and the barn will be erected during the summer of 1914. Fourteen head of pure bred Holstein cattle have been purchased for this farm, and others will be added to the herd as soon as the ham is completed. It is proposed to demonstrate the relative values of different kinds of feed grown in the North Platte valley and to illustrate </seg>
            <seg id="p015">™ methods of management by which dairying can be developed by the farmers of this region. THE VALENTINE SUBSTATION In recognition of the importance of information with regard to the seeding and culture of alfalfa on sandy soil, experiments have been undertaken to determine the varieties best suited to conditions here, and also the best methods and time of seeding. Sweet clover has also been studied, as this plant has recently attracted attention in this section, where it has been considered superior to alfalfa and easier to secure a stand on sandy soil. For comparison of results, these two plants were seeded side by side in most of the experiments conducted at this Substation, but conclusive data are not vet available. Potato experiments to determine the best methods of grow - ing seed that would maintain or increase in vitality, and to find some variety that might take the place of the old Early Ohio, which is the potato now grown almost exclusively for commer - cial purposes thruout the sandhill country, have been carried on for two seasons now. the Early Ohio showing, in the Superin - tendent's opinion, evidence of decreasing vitality. This experi - ment, if successful, might result in much advantage to growers. Grain Sorghums. — The problem with these is to get some - thing that will mature in average years, and a number of va - rieties furnished by the Bureau at Washington have been experi - mented with during the past two seasons. Meauow Improvement Experiments. — These have consisted of attempts at seeding the lower lying hay flats to different kinds of clover, including red, sweet, white, and alsike clovers, and have embraced methods of seeding, and varieties best adapted for this purpose. Trf.i: Planting Experiments. — These have consisted of the planting of a grove and windbreak, and have been confined to a determination of varieties best suited to this section, and to methods of cultivation, including mulching with manure, water - ing, and growing by aid of clean cultivation, sun sheltering of evergreens, etc. Steer Feeding. — An experiment along this line which has proved of great local interest was conducted for the purpose of trying to determine the value of silage as a roughage when </seg>
            <seg id="p016">alfalfa hay. us compared to these hays when each alone was fed with coin. When silage was led with alfalfa or corn, the amount of these was cut in two as compared with when either was being fed as the sole roogaage. Market prices on feeds were us.-d. and on both the baying and the selling ends of the Mock ile;'!. The experiment was conducted for 147 days. brginaiBg in I&gt;eceml&gt;er and ending in April, 1913. I The dairy barn at the Valentine Substation has In-en coin ted and a herd of dairy cattle has been installed. This &lt; &lt;&gt;n - 8 of one llolstein bull and twelve pure bred Holstein cowl ether with a numl&gt;er of grade cows. It is the parpOK of this tion to determine the relative profits on grade and pure bred rj cows, and to compare the different rations which are ilab!e for farmers, so as to determine the best methods of nagittg dairy cattle in this region. THE SCOTTSBLl'FF SUBSTATION I Work is continued at the Scottsbluff Substation along all lines previously undertaken. This includes rotation of (TOpi ler irrigation, a study of the varieties of wheat, oats, barley. n. and potatoes. K Experiments have Ikhmi undertaken to determine the value of ige crops for pasture of swine and the value of unmarketihle ntoes in fattening hogs when used in connection with a jrriin on. A herd of dairy cattle is to be established at this Station to encourage dairying in the region. I This Station is cooperating with the farmers of the region determine the most profitable use of alfalfa, lieet pulp, and • grade molasses in connection with the grains produced in region. THE CULBERTSON DEMONSTRATION FARM ■ A barn to house horses, grain, and forage has Ik'cii er. the ('ulbertson Demonstration Farm. tl'lats have been laid out to determine the best rotations ler irrigation. Tests of dry fanning methods are also in ration at this Station. THE STATION STAFF Within the past year the following changes in the Station staff have taken place: </seg>

AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION The Department of Agricultural Extension, during the year ending June 30. 1913. has conducted 224 Farmers' Institutes, with 065 sessions, having an average attendance at each session of 18fi. It has conducted seven Senior Short Courses holding day and evening sessions for five days at each point, with an average attendance of 327 at each day session and with an average at - tendance of 417 at each evening session. Seven Junior Short Courses were held, of five days each, with an average attendance of from 120 to 180 at day sessions and from 100 to 350 at eve - ning sessions. A Dairy Special demonstration train was run over the Northwestern Railway from Verdigris to Crawford, and over the Burlington Railway from Crawford to Grand Island and from the western line of the State to Holdrege on the "high line" of the Burlington. Sixty-eight stops were made during the two weeks that the train was in operation. Twenty-seven thousand and forty-nine people visited the train and heard the lectures. This made an average of 397 people at each stop. On this trip a herd of dairy cows was carried to demonstrate type and breed characteristics, an exhibit car to show dairy equip - ment, illustrating best methods* of dairying, and coaches in which dairy lectures were given. The Extension service is assisting different counties in or - ganizing farm demonstration work, thru which it Is proposed to place a trained man in the community to assist the farmers in the study of farm problems where such cooperation is desired. Five counties were organized on this basis during the year 1913, and a number of counties have since organized or are in process of such organization. During the biennium which opened April 1, 1913, an appro - priation of $50,000 was provided by the Legislature to care for the work of Agricultural Extension under the College of Agri culture. At the present time a bill is pending before Congress known as the Lever bill, which will appropriate flO.OOO annually to each State for extension work and after the first year wil make available nn additional sum for those States which make </seg>

The 1 &gt;i 1 1 is progressive in its ap - |)ro|iriiiti(ms and will finally make available the sum of $3. - (MHI.IMIO annually for distribution among the several States of the I'nion for extension purposes. The meetings of Organized Agriculture were held during the week January 10-iU. 1914. bringing a large number of farmers to Lincoln. Most of these meetings were held at the University Farm. A porn show, apple show, and home cured meat show were made at the City Auditorium. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The agricultural press, and especially those paper! located wit hi n the State, have shown their appreciation of the work of the Kxperiment Station by giving literal space to experimental work reported and in every way facilitating the extension of useful agricultural knowledge. </seg>
