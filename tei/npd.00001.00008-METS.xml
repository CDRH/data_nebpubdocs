have the honor to present the biennial report of the Nebraska 

State Penitentiary, covering the time between the 1st daf of 

December, 1880

RECOMMENDATIONS

at an early date. I shall summarily expose here our want-. 

WATER SUPPLY. 

I recommend the sinking of an artesian well. The water supply 
in an institution of this character ought to be abunda' I 
many reasons.</seg> 

            <seg id="p008">
upport of the institution : to the 

1882, and prisoners discharged daring the lac 
series of tabular statements and statistics concern 

Many or the recommendations made in my last biennial report 
bave been either overlooked or for some reason have not 

taken into consideration. 

The improvements and repairs then urged were needed, and 

it this time, after a tp*C6 of two years, are a necessity. 

I earnestly ask your honorable body to gire this matter your 

attention, and urm upon the Legislature the passage of appro- 


It is hardly possible for one not acquainted with the numerou 

He of our interior to realize the enormous quantity of water 

»uirt-(] daily for culinary, mechanical and hygienic purp&lt; 
)ur main water supply is derived from I well located ( 

hill, southwest of the prison. A windmill furnishes the power 

to elevate water from the well into a reservoir thirty feet squar 

in 1 six feet deep. This well, with its present motive power 

doee not furnish a sufficient supply of water. 

Our only alternative, then, is to carry and haul nearly all the 

r used for the purposes above related from inferior wells 

provided with wooden hand pumps, scattered over the premises. 
In what condition, in the event of a conflagration, would such 

a state of affairs leave us ? 

That our sewerage system — which is bad, indeed, without the 

complications arising through lack of water — is not the 

&gt;1 

epidemic sickness and disease, is another of the numerous fact 

for which there is no comprehensible explanation. The. insuffi- 

iency of water to carry off excrements causes an almost con 

tant stoppage of the sewage, and, it may be added, maintainin 

an unhealthy and dangerous stench about the premises. 
This question of water supply, in my estimation, dominat 

all others, and should be carefully inquired into 

A _Teat responsibility would rest somewhere if, in the ev 

onriairration, a portion or all of the perishable property of 

this institution should become the prey of flame 

Many ways and means may be devised to give us the, vratei 

supply so much needed ; the mention I made of an artesian well 

must be taken for what it is really worth and no more. In so 

doing I have had one aim in view: to present to your honorable 

body, the present condition of our water supply system 

CISTERNS FOR THE STORAGE OF RAINWATER FOR THE USE OF BOILERS 

I recommend the construction of cistern 

Ehe construction of a mammoth cistern or of a number of cis-

TONE STEPS OF MAIN ENTRANCE 

I recommend that a new set of steps to the main entrant*;

stone steps is pressin

NEBRASKA BTAT1 PENITENTIARY. 

At the time mentioned in the above provision then will remain 
confined in this penitentiary a certain number of United States, 
New Mexico and Wyoming Territory prisoner! whose sent*- 

we will find ourselves entangled in the following dilemma: That 
we are commanded by the courts of other states and territories, 

to keep in custody prisoners, whom, according to a law of our 
State, we are commanded not to keep. 

The consequences such a situation would produce are plainly 
isible and I shall not insist. 

I recommend the repeal of the provision of the law referred 
), or its amendment in a way consistent with the situation. 

PRISON PHYSICIAN AND CHAPLAIN. 

The medical and religious departments of the prison are under 
the respective charge and care of Dr. J. O. Carter and Rev. 
C. C. Harris, of Lincoln, and could not be entrusted to better 
hands. 

As a practitioner, Doctor Carter stands in the foremost rank 
of the profession, while the ability and success of Rev. Harris, 
as a divine, are recognized facts. 

Both are gentlemen — the choice of whom to the position they 
occupy is an honor to the Board — using every endeavor and devoting 
a great part of their time to the physical and mora wellfare 
of the inmates of the prison. 

Of our official as well as private relations, I cannot but think 
highly, and publicly tender them my official acknowledgments. 

I would refer your honorable body to their respective reports 
herewith appended. 

o 


will bo unexpired, besides those sentenced for life. 

The sentences of all the foreign prisoners, as shown by the mit- 

timus by virtue of which they are held, implicitly declare that the 

prisoners shall be confined in the Nebraska State penitentiary, 

and formally command the Warden of said penitentiary to re-
