Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Itentlemen: Your communication of &lt; October :!•&gt;. in which i asked for the opinion of this department with reference the right of a public mi vice corporation to withdraw iTtain portion of its capita] stock without the permission your commission, was inadvertently overlooked. The correspondence submitted by you shows that the North Platte (Jas &amp; Electric Company was organized, and it- original articles of incorporation filed with the secretary of state, on March 27. liXW; that, at the time of its incorpora - tion, it lield a franchise from the Hty of North Platte for the manufacture and furnishing of electric light and power in that city; that it also held a franchise from said city authorizing it to erect and construct a iras plant; that the original purpose of the corporation was to establish the iras plant, but this project was entirely abandoned and its franchise for that purpose was later forfeited; that, when it had both projects in mind, that of furnishing electric light and also gas for the city, it authorized an issue of cap - ital stock of $250,000 and a bond issue of *i:&gt;l).lMM&gt; ; that, after the gas project was abandoned, the corporation .found it was unnecessary to have such a large amount of capital stock or to issue bonds for the amount originally contem - plated; that, in June, 191:2, it amended its articles of incor - poration and filed -aid amendment with the secretary of </seg>
            <seg id="p092">2 Ite, by which its original stock was reduced from $250,- I to $100,000 and its bond issue reduced from $150,000 $&lt;iO,&lt;!00; and that by said amendment the company kBged its name from North Platte Gas &amp; Electric Com - ly to North Platte Electric Company. The &lt;)uestion which confronts your commission is whether the voluntary surrender, withdrawal, and cancellation by the corporation of its stocks and bonds, in the manner afore - said, should have been submitted for your approval, under ihe provisions of House Roll 578. I loose Roll 578 was a bill for an act to regulate the issu - •e of stocks, bonds, and other forms of indebtedness of won carriers and public service corporations, and pro - ed that stocks, bonds, and evidences of indebtedness of )lic service corporations might be issued when permis - u therefor was authorized by the commission and when ■ -onimi«sion found the same were necessary for the liiisition of property, the construction, completion, oiiMon, or improvement of facilities or for the improve - ut or maintem u&lt; c at ita service, or for the dis^h*rgfc lawful refunding of its obligations. In iry judgment, House Roll 578 was passed for the pur - pose of preventing the watering of stocks or over-capital - ization thereof, and that this law was not designed to pre - vent a public carrier or public service corporation from voluntarily reducing its capital stock and bond issue by duly amending its articles of incorporation and filing the pame with the secretary of state. It appears from this correspondence that the original organization took place prior to the time House Roll 578 was pawed by the legislature of 1909 and became a law. Fmin the correspondence, it appears that the reduction of the capital stock and the limitation of bond issue were found necessary because of the abandonment of the eor - poration'a original purpose to establish a gas plant, and </seg>
            <seg id="p093">3 were made they were done in good faith and for the purpose of preventing an apparent overcapitalization of the cor - poration. This action on the part of the corj&gt;oration does not amount to an issuance of new stock. Neither does it amount to a refund of its capital stock nor of its outstanding liabil - ities. For these reasons, the provisions of House Roll 578 do not apply to the instant case, and the commission does not have jurisdiction over the subject-matter thereof. respectfully, GRANT (J.

Attorney OenermL Certificate of Sale — Payment of Costs. rr the Scavenger law, the costs for issuing a certificate of sale should be deducted, by the county treasurer, from the amount of the bid. J. J. McAllister, Esq., County Attorney of Dakota County, Dakota City, Neb Dear Sir : Yours of the 8th instant has been duly received. You ask whether, under the Scavenger law, the costs for inning certificates of sale should be deducted, bv the countv treasurer, from the amount of the bid, or whether this cer - tificate fee should be paid by the purchaser. Section '2'2, article 9, chapter 77, Compiled Statutes of 1911, provides that the county treasurer shall execute ami deliver to the purchaser of each parcel or lot of land a certif - icate, and then follows the form thereof. The form indi - cates that the certificate is to be issued to the highest and best bidder. The treasurer being required, under this section, to deliver to the purchaser this certificate, he would not be authorized to demand more of the purchaser than the amount which he bid. This contemplates that the certificate fee be taken from the amount of the bid rather than charged against the purchaser at the sale. This holding is in accord with the former ruling of this department (Report i Opin- </seg>

I Nebraska State Railway Commission has power to investigate transfer facilities required under chapter 101, Session Laws of 1909, to be placed at points of intersection, connection, or cross - ing of different railroads, and its orders in relation thereto should be supported by findings of fact that the proposed facilities are both practicable and reasonably necessary. I Nebraska State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction in the absence of statute, to order the construction of joint depots at the points of intersection of two different railroads. Nebraska Staff Railuay Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Kentlemen: This department is in receipt of yours of the l instant, which is ;is follows: ' Calling your attention to chapter 101, Session Laws of 1909, I am directed by the commission to submit to you the following questions: "Section 1 provides, inter alia: I All railroad companies in this state, at all points of connection, •section, or crossing at grades of different railroads, where it is ticable, shall provide reasonable, ample, and equal facilities, by i connection, passenger platforms, and otherwise, for transferring passengers and property between their respective roads, without asonable delay; and at any place where the tracks of the two oad companies are within five hundred feet apart, whether on the ; grade or not, where it is practicable and deemed reasonably ssary, the state railway commission, upon application of any inter - i person, may require such track connection.' "1. Where there is an intersection or crossing of two different railroads, is this statute mandatory upon a railroad company to pro - \ide passenger platforms for the transfer of passengers, where it is practicable? </seg>
            <seg id="p095">5 ■2. What interpretation should be given the word 'practicable' lin the meaning of this statute? EDo the words 'and deemed reasonably necessary,' following the colon, apply to the portion of the sentence preceding the semi - i, and in the case of track crossings must the commission make a ng that the proposed facilities are both practicable and deemed inably necessary? E Under this statute, has the commission jurisdiction to order in nt depot at the point of intersection, if practicable or if deemed mably necessary? R5. If in your opinion the commission has not authority to require intersecting roads to construct a joint depot, to what extent has urisdiction to order facilities for the transferring of cars, passen - i, and property?" Ehe substance of your Hist three inquiries have been di- - ;c&lt;l and passed upon by this department in an opinion fered your body on November 20, 1911, ■ portion of tli is as follows: "Under the first provision of this section are railroad companies required to provide transfer facilities at all points of connection, inter - section, or crossing of different railroads, regardless of whether such transfer facilities are reasonable and necessary for the conduct of business at the points involved? The law does not require a vain and useless thing to be done. Observation and experience teach that it is very common for one railroad to cross another at a point where it would be a waste of money and an unnecessary hardship to require the installation of transfer facilities. fine word 'practicable' is not here used in a physical or mechanical e. but rather in a commercial or business sense. There is authority its use in that sense. (I nitnl stutis w. Wlm, 7 Fed., 190; The Ben - 51 Fed., 302.) "It may be argued that this word 'practicable' is used in a mechan - ical sense in the first instance, inasmuch as in the second clause of the section, where the transfer facilities are required to be placed at points where the tracks of two railroads are within five hundred feet apart, this word 'practicable' is joined with the words 'and deemrd reasonably necessary.' But, the argument that the latter words aro used as somewhat definite of the former and perhaps as almost synon - ymous with it, is equally as convincing as the contrary view. K Under this section sufficient transfer facilities are required to be :ed at such points of construction, intersection, or crossing of dif - nt railroads as are deemed feasible from a mechanical and enu - ring point of view, provided the commerce, business, and necessities </seg>
            <seg id="p096">6 Ehe people demand their installation. It then becomes the duty of commission to take into consideration all these facts and circum - ces. and make its order accordingly. In any event, its order must easonable. An order to place transfer facilities where there is no ness necessity for them would be unreasonable. I am strengthened his view when I read the section following, which is as follows: " 'The state railway commission is hereby empowered and required to investigate all cases arising under this act, whether upon complaint or otherwise, and to make such order in the premises as shall seem reasonable, and to fix a time for compliance with said order.' (Com - piled Statutes of 1909, ch. 72, art. 1, sec. 30b.) KThus, the power to investigate matters of this kind is lodged in commission, and its orders in relation thereto should be governed their reasonableness as disclosed by the investigation." (Report Opinions of Attorney General for 1911-1912, pp. 44, 45.) The views expressed therein are still adhered to, and answer your questions one, two, and three. Answering questions four and five will say this law does not specifically authorize the commission to order the estab - lishing of a joint depot on railroads at points of connection or intersection. The legislature seems to have purposely avoided using the words "depot or joint depot" in this act, otherwise it would have been natural to have provided for the ir establishment in specific terms. The constitutional provision, creating the railway commission, gives it general j&gt;owers over the service of public carriers, as the legislature shall provide by law, but it also provides that, in the absence of specific legislation, the commission shall exercise the [lowers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision. Here the legislature has undertaken to prescribe the powers of the commission with reference to requiring railroad com - panies to furnish facilities at connecting or intersecting points, but, as observed before, it does not expressly require such companies to establish a depot. E might be argued, with sound reason, that, inasmuch as legislature has specifically provided for cases of this , thereafter the commission could not exercise greater Ms Hud on flip fiTPiiPrji 1 oon^titiitiOTvil i &gt;rov 1 si on tliMii flip </seg>

I'rom information derived from a member of your body, arn that one of the railroad companies concerned ha* a iot and station facilities located in or near the business ter of the city, and it is thus situated at a point where company naturally secures a larger proportion of public ronage than its competitor. If required to abandon this ition, or to duplicate these facilities at a point farther in the business center where this road intersects that of competitor, such requirement might work a previous dship upon the company, and might possibly ml li an order to judicial attack, on the ground of taking company's property without just compensation. It is true the lights, convenience, and welfare of the pub - lic are to be fully considered at all times, but even these cannot justify a law or an order of the commission which is violative of this constitutional prohibition. This law evi - dently was meant to cover cases which might arise where new villages are starting, or where railroad business is demanding a more sj&gt;eedy outlet at points of railroad inter - section. In such cases, your body is authorized to order in Mich track connection, passenger platforms, and facilities as may be considered by vou practicable and reasonably necessary for the handling of property and the accommoda - tion of passengers in making transfer from one road to the other. In such instances, there might arise the necessity for the railroad companies to construct depots or waiting rooms sufficient to protect and accommodate the traveling public.

But, as sug - ted above, neither the law under consideration, nor the (visions of the railway commission act, was intended to horize the commission to order railroad companies to mdon their station facilities already located by them at ivenient and profitable places for the purposes of their -iness and to reestablish such facilities on the basis of a at enterprise at inconvenient or remote places, simply •ause their lines happen to intersect, connect, or run close ether at certain points. To recapitulate: 1. The word "practicable" in the law is not used in a physical or mechanical sense, but rather in a commercial or business sense. I!. This act imposes upon the commission the duty of estimating all cases which might arise under this pro - ion, in making such orders in the premises only as shall deemed reasonable. This presupposes that where there in intersecting or crossing of two railroad lines, and the npanies fail to act on their own initiative, the commis - n may, on either complaint or on its own initiative, have tearing and pass upon the practicability and the reason - eness of the facilities needed and make orders therefor it may see fit, at all times keeping in mind the rule that orders must stand the test of judicial inquiry. .!. The orders of the commission made, under the provi - sions of tins act. should be supported by findings of fact that the proposed track connection, passenger platforms, and facilities which the companies are required to install at points of intersecting railroads, are both practicable and reasonably necessary. 4.

Under this act, the commission is clearly authorised to order in transfer facilities for both freight and passenger business: that such facilities should, under certain cin-i-m - stances, include buildings or waiting rooms, which might properly be designated depots; that these should be limited to cases where such installation is practicable, reasonable, and necessary for the transfer of property and passengers, after taking into consideration the facilities already afforded by the companies in the village or city on their separate lines &lt;".. The law expressly provides for a division of the expenses in the construction of tracks and switches for track connection. Hence, these expenses become joint obli - gations of the companies affected. But. as to the cost of platforms and other facilities at points of intersection, the law is silent. This sihnce of the statute indicates that ordeis of the commission, with reference to passenger platforms and other facilities, should issue against the Iipanies separately, and joint contribution for the same. onnd desirable, should be voluntary on the part of the ipaniea concerned.

Railroad Companies — Passes — Employee's Housekeeper. rilroad company is prohibited, under the anti-pass law, from issuing free transportation to an employee's housekeeper, who receives compensation for the services rendered such employee. Xi brmskm State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Kentlemen: I beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the i instant, in which you submit the following question: Is it a violation of the anti-pass law for a railroad company to issue Iree transportation to a housekeeper who is employed by an employee of the company, and who devotes her entire time to keeping house and to looking after such employee's children? El this connection you have called my attention to "Con - nee Rulings Bulletin No. 5 of the Interstate CoBUMrw imission," issued April 1, 1911, and to subdivision c, ing No. !»."), thereof, reading as follows: IThe commission holds that the word 'family,' as used in section the act to regulate commerce, includes those who are members of, who habitually reside in, the household of the person eligible to ive family passes, including household servants when traveling l the family or with any member thereof, and relatives who are in dependent upon such person, although not actually residing in household. (See Rules 92 and 174.) The commission will, there - !, view passes in the following form as lawful: ' 'Pass John Smith, wife, two sons, three daughters, and two ser - vants.' " 'Pass Mrs. John Smith and daughter, account John Smith, Agent X. Y. &amp; Z. Railroad Company at Washington, D. C " The interstate commerce act is much move liberal in its terms, with reference to the granting of free passes, than ait- the provisions of onr state law in relation to the rame subject. The interstate commerce ad prohibits a common </seg>
            <seg id="p101">OPINIONS 11 Irier from issuing or giving "any interstate free ticket, &gt; pass, or free transportation for passengers, except to employees and their families, its officers, agent-. Ber - ts, physicians, and attorneys at law." The Nebraska permits a railroad company to issue free transportation ts "officers, agents, bona fide employees, the major por - i of whose time is devoted to the services of such rail - d company, and to the depend cut members of their im le families." Inder the interstate commerce act, the employees W nts of a railroad company may receive free transporta - i, whether they are devoting a part or the whole of their e to the company's service, whereas under the Nebraska such agents or employees, before they are entitled to jive free transportation, must devote the major portion heir time to the service of the company. Likewise, under interstate commerce act, the word "families" i- not ited in any particular. The families of the employees le within the excepted class, whereas under the N'ebra&gt;ka free transportation is limited to the "dependent Klein - s'' of the employees' families. The interstate commerce commission, as indicated above, lias held that the word "families," without any qualifying term used in the law, may include paid servants of the families. This construction cannot be given the Nebraska law, for the word "dependent" is evidently used in its ordinary sense and means one who is not self sustaining; one who is sustained by another; one who relies upon another for support. If the housekeeper referred to in your question i&gt; paid for the services which she renders the employee of the rail - road company, as such housekeeper, she can in no &gt;&lt;'ii&gt;c be deemed a "dependent member" of the employee's family, Bad, under this law, those who are entitled to free transpor - tation must be "dependent members of the immediate tarn- </seg>

When so consid - ered, the classes who may receive free transportation under the laws of this state are much more circumscribed than those under the federal law. Ii your communication you say that the housekeeper employed. I take it from this she was paid wages for services. If so, she would not be entitled to free trans - ation under the laws of our state. If, however, she not receiving wages for the services she rendered, but dependent upon the employee of the company who ived her services, and was a member of his immediate ily. she would come within the excepted classes which entitled to free transportation.

If the vacancy referred to occurred during the present session of this legislature, there is no douht about your right to till the same by appointment. Iknow of no way by which the membership of the present sion could be determined until the legislature convened .January 7. 1913, to appoint its credentials committee and ascertain who were the duly selected representatives for various districts. This, at least, would be the only icial way to determine that matter.

I 'he house having ascertained that there is a vacancy in t representative district, and it being the only body or liority upon whom the law confers the right to pass upon [ determine the question of membership, election, and lifications thereof, it is quite clear to my mind that the •ancy occurred during its regular session.

Even if it should be conceded, for the sake of the argu - ment, that a special election should have been held to till the vacancy caused by Mr. Taylor's death, the fact remains that no such election was held. The statute expressly pro - vides that one of the ways by which a vacancy in office may arise is by a failure to elect at the proper election, there being no incumbent to continue in office until his snecet is elected and qualified.

Dear Sir: You have made a verbs] request for ;in opinion from this office on the question of whether or not inheritance taxes and registration *feei under the motor vehicle act may lit- used by the county board in the regular construction and maintenance of roads. The motor vehicle act provides "All registration fees provided for in this act shall be paid to the treasurer of the county in which the applicant for registration reaidos. and shall be credited to the county road fund for the construction and maintenance of permanent roads." (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, sec. 6231.) fn the legislative intention as to what permanent road - rests the answer to the second par! of your question. word "permanent" is defined in the Standard Diction as follows: Eontinuing or intending to continue in the same state, or without ge destructive of the essential form or nature; durable; opposed mporary." I am disposed to think the legislature here meant that these fees might be used for the construction and mainte - nance of public roads which have bee*i permanently estab - lished. A construction of the language here might also be that by "permanent roads" the legislature meant those which are constructed of more enduring material than the soil, such as macadamized roads. I Jut, the fact that these fees are to be paid into the county d fund leads me to believe the legislature meant that the uty board might use them as an undetermined part of b fund in the construction and maintenance of any of pciinanent roads of the county.

Ippareutly, this is an authority to the effect that a rail - 1 corporation, organized under the special railroad cor - iition law, is also required to comply with all the pro- OM of the general corporation laws.

There was a time in England, and it prevailed to some extent in this country, when railroads were constructed on the money derived from stock subscriptions. Of late years, it -.cms that enterprises of this kind are often capitalized for a sufficient amount to make the surveys and do the preliminary work, and that the real co'istruction and equip - ment of the road is provided for by the sale of bonds and securities. 1 do not know whether the legislature had this condition of affairs, relative to railroad construction, in mind at the time it passed the special act, providing for railroad incor - poration. One thing is sine, that the law-making power of the territory provided as early as 1856 for the incorpora - tion of general corporations, under which almost any mil df a corporation might have become incorporated, and that nine yeais thereafter the legislature saw fit to enact a law, the subject of which specifically related to the incorpora - tion of railroads and prescribed in every detail for their organization. I am forced, by reason of the action of this slature and the decisions of the courts of other states, as well as our own, to the conclusion that the legislature of Ih'4. when it passed a specific act providing for railroad incorporation, intended that such special act should be con - sidered a qualification of the provisions of the more genera 1 one passed something like nine years before. I, therefore, conclude in answer to your first, second, and third questions that, if the railroad company under consid - eration was incorporated under the special railroad incor poration act, it is not required to state the highest amount of indebtedness to which it may be subject and that it is not limited in the issuance of its bonds to two-thirds of the amount of its capital stock.

Shelburn, Esq., County Attorney of Harlem County, Alma, Nek Dear Sir: I beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 20th instant, which is as follows: IAt the time of the assessment in 1912, a party in this county owned ain personal property, which was assessed in his name for that year. June 6, 1912, the owner gave a chattel mortgage on this property, ch was then properly filed. After the first of November, 1912, the ty in whose name the property was assessed, died. Which is prior, tax lien or the chattel mortgage?" IJnder our old revenue law, which required the tax books be delivered to the collector, and fixed that as the time en the taxes levied should become a lien on the personal &gt;perty of the tax debtor, our supreme court held that a ittel mortgage given upon the property, ante-dating the ; lien, would be superior to the lien for taxes for that ir created by the delivery of the tax books to the collector, t that said chattel mortgage would be inferior to the tax a for subsequent years. (Platte Valley Milling Co. v. ilmsten, 79 Neb., 730.) {Phis same rule, in substance, has been announced in other ses by our court. The law under consideration in those ;es was, in substance, that the taxes assessed upon per - lal property should be a lien upon the personal property the person assessed from and after the time the tax books re received by the collector. It will be observed that this provision of the law makes </seg>
            <seg id="p127">37 the tax a lien not upon the specific property taxed l»ut a lien upon the personal property of the person assessed. The law. as it exists at the present time, provides that taxes assessed upon personal property shall be a first lien upon the personal property of the person to whom assessed from and after the first day of November in the year in which they are assessed, until paid. In construing this section, full force and effect should he given the words "first lien." From your statement, I take it that the property mort - gaged remained in the possession of the mortgagor until the tax lien attached on the first day of November, 1012, and thereafter the mortgagor died. This law, making poi - sonal taxes levied against a person a lien on the first day of November, was in existence at the time the mortgagee took the mortgage, and the law in relation thereto was a part of the mortgage contract. He took the mortgage knowing of the law, and he is bound by the provisions thereof. He knew that all property upon which he might hold a chattel mortgage was subject to the statutory provision which would make the tax lien against the mortgagor a first lien upon all property remaining in his hands on the first day of November of each year. The tax lien referred to by you is -upeiior to the mortgage lien. This is in accord with a prior holding of this department. (Report &amp; Opinions of Attorney General, 1903-1904, p 207.)

It is impossible to answer your question definitely, with - full knowledge as to the plan of organization of these npanies, the amount of capital which they own, if r, and the kind of insurance which they propose to write, lay say, in a general way, that very early in the history the legislation of this state provision was made for the nission of foreign mutual insurance companies. Election 13, chapter 25, Revised Statutes of 1866, is as ows: "Mutual insurance companies incorporated by any state or territory other than the state of Nebraska, upon filing in the office of the audi - tor the act of incorporation of said company, together with a written instrument under seal of said company, signed by the president and secretary of said company under oath, certifying that said company is possessed of a capital of at least one hundred thousand dollars, secured by lien on real estate, worth at cash valuation at least five times the amount of said capital, and not encumbered to more than one fourth of said cash valuation, shall be entitled to a certificate from said auditor, with authority to transact business of insurance in this state, and said company shall be exempt from the provisions of this subdivision, with the exception of the publication of statement and certificate of the auditor."

The legislature of 1911 provided for the appointment, by the governor, of B commission whose duty it would be to revise the general laws of the state. This was done pur - suant to chapter KJfi, Laws of 1911. The governor &lt;&gt;f the state at that time appointed Hon. A. M. Po&gt;t. Boa. E. L. King-, and Hon. J. II. Broady as the commission. This com - mission rewrote the laws of the state, had the saint' printed, and made its report to the present session of the legislature. Dining the present session, the compilation of the laws of the commission, as rewritten by it, were duly adopted, approved, and made of force as the Revised Statutes of the State of Nebraska for 1913. The section quoted above is a ]&gt;art of the work of that commission, and is now the law of this state relating to the paid up capital required of foreign insurance companies seeking admission to transact their business in this state.

The office of dis - •t judge is ■ constitutional office, and the salary of said &lt;■&lt;■ is fixed by the constitution itself. It has been, I think, uniformly held by the courts of this state that, where the constitution itself fixes the salary of a constitutional officer, no specific appropriation by the legislature is necessary, although such appropriations are customarily made. "The constitution fixing the salary of an officer, and providing that 'the auditor shall draw warrants of the state quarterly' therefor, 'which shall be paid out of any funds not otherwise appropriated,' appropriates by law the amount necessary to pay such salary, and no legislative act is necessary.' (Stutr rr rrl., RMertl r. WfuHm, 4 Neb., 216.)

"In order to make a popular election legal, there must be a time fixed in advance for holding it, either by law or by the officer or officers empowered by law to appoint the time; and if no time be fixed in either manner no valid election can be held. If the time is fixed by general law, that will govern and no election can be held At any other time except under statutes providing for special elections." (15 Cyc, 341.) Kumerous cases might be cited in support of the above ed proposition. I will quote from one of them: "The power to fix the times of holding elections for county officers is vested by the constitution in the legislature, and when a time has been so fixed by that body, any election for such officers held at a different time is unauthorized and void."

ID. Dniliucr, Esq., County Attorney of Dinnl/i County, Benkelman, Neb. E'ear Sir: I be&lt;i; to acknowledge receipt of your recent er to this office, asking for an opinion on the following stion: EV'here a husband, in 1904, purchased the land of his wife under Scavenger act and a certificate of sale was issued to him. he ining no deed thereunder, are the taxes still a lien on the land'.'" You state that one J. W. Kinisey purchased the land of his wife, under the Scavenger act, for *41._&lt;&gt;, which was not the full amount of the taxes then standing against this land. Mr. Kimsey let his tax sale certificate go and secured no deed under it. I The Scavenger tax act was enacted for the purpose of taring the tax-list of properties over-burdened with tea, and to do this in a way that would secure to the rious state and municipal government* all that the operty would bring at judicial sale. It provided for an tion in rem against the land, and a judicial sale to the srhest bidder. 'Phis act has been sustained by the supreme court in Woodron§h v. Dovfku ('&lt;&gt;., 71 Xeb.. :::,4, that being the fust oa^e involving its constitutionality. In this case it was argued that this act sought to release or commute taxes, and was. therefor, in conflict with the constitution. But, the court took the ground that it is not a release or commutation of the taxes, but rather an extinguishment of the tax lien, so far as the state is concerned. Tt was under this view of the matter that the court sustained the Scav - enger act as a constitutional one. Tn his opinion. Judge </seg>
            <seg id="p146">56 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I The sale of land to satisfy a tax lien Thereon is an extinguishmtiu he lien, which becomes merged in the title thus conveyed. There - • it is not a release or commutation. A release is a discharge of a t by act of the party; an extinguishment is a discharge by oper - &gt;n of law; a release is a voluntary relinquishment of a lien and it of action or an obligation. In a foreclosure the liens do not Linue as incumbrances on the land, but by operation of Law they extinguished. In the proceeding to foreclose tax liens provided in this act the liens are extinguished, and are not released either the legislature or by the voluntary act of any public officer act - under authority from that body." Ellis, it appears to me, answers your question. Again, 'it?, of Beatrice v. Wright, 72 Neb., 698, this interpret;! of the Scavenger act is approved.

This, however, cannot be done until the premium period have expired. If Mr. Kinisey still has his tax sale certificate, he could, ler this section, have it canceled and it would amount to redemption. This seems an added reason for believing it the lien for all back taxes was discharged by the sale the land. Ebe question might arise whether the husband would e an interest in the land of his wife sufficient to pre - le his purchasing her land at a tax -ale. It is of course, </seg>
            <seg id="p147">OPINIONS 57 a well established principle that one who i&gt; in any way duty bound to pay the taxes cannot purchase at a tax sale, and such attempt to purchase becomes a redemption rather than a purchase. Erhe later decisions of the courts have gone on the theory t the husband and the wife do not have such interest! the other's property as to prevent them from purcha&gt; such property at tax sale. The law, of course, permits wife to own and control her own real estate, and the ■band is in nowise duty bound to pay the taxes thereon. II do not find that the Nebraska court has passed upon s question but the Kansas court passed upon it squarely Xaftlr v. Tiepermmu, 85 Pac, 941, !» L H. A. (X. S.)

Endiana has enunciated a similar doctrine in WiUard i. ie*. 130 hid , 351. I am inclined to think that our own court would take the same view of the matter. {am. therefore, of the opinion that when the state sold s land in 1!&gt;II4 to Mr. Kimsey, he purchasing it in good th with his own money, all prior tax liens were extin ished and all interest of the state in the land was eased.

At that time, as now, county boards were forbidden to allow warrants in excess of eighty-five per cent of the amount levied, where there was no money in the treasury to pay them. This inhibition still applies, so far as the county board is concerned, but in 1011 the provision theretofore pre - vailing, regarding the allowance of claims against the county and the drawing of warrants therefor, was modified so as to make the claims of jurors in the district court an exception to the general rule, in that such claims are not lequired to be audited and allowed by the county board and that the county clerk draws warrants for same with - out such auditing and allowance. (Compiled Statutes of 1911, ch. IS, art. 1, sec. 33.)

IPhe law of this state does not seem to provide for the untary dissolution of mutual hail insurance companies, iinarily, the business of institutions of this kind is und up by proceedings in court, through the appoint - nt of a receiver. The general corporation law of the te, as shown by section 27, article 2, chapter 14. Kevw-&lt;1 tutes of 1913, provides that no corporation can be (Ba - red by the members thereof except by consent of two - rds of all its members, which consent must be entered its record, unless the articles of incorporation adopted the corporation provide otherwise. If the Security Mutual Hail Insurance Company wishes become dissolved, and to bring this about on its own tion, it would seem that the proper course to pursue nld be to secure the consent of two-thirds of its members, er this consent on the records of the company, and then •e the company order its board of directors, or designate h officers as it may see fit, to proceed to wind up its liis. When it has pursued this course, and has ascer - led that there are no claims against its loss fund, it aid be proper for it to proceed to pay its just and lawful igations out of this loss fund designated in your eora - nication. The company could also, through its membership, order a distribution of the residue, after all obligations were paid, among its polieyholders, and this should be, in my judgment, distributed among the ]&gt;olieyholders as of the date of its dissolution.

Dear Sir: You have submitted to this department the salary voucher of the stenographer for the fifteenth judicial district, also the salary voucher of the deputy insurance commissioner. I Hie salaries of the stenographers of the various judicial tricts had, prior to the last session of the legislature, n fixed at the sum of $1500 per annum. The last session the legislature increased the salaries of these stenog - &gt;heis to $2000 each. This law has no emergency clause, 1. hence, does not take effect, under the constitution, :il July 17, 1913. The appropriation made for these tries, however, was fixed at the sum of (2000 per annum, 1 paned with the emergency clause. The question which sea relative to the salaries of these stenographers is ether or not the appropriation made, which fixed the rease, governs and determines the amount to be paid to se stenographers prior to the time the law increasing ir salaries actually takes effect. This question has been passed upon by my predecessor. Attorney (ieneral Thompson. While expressing some doubt as to what the courts would hold this question, Mr. Thompson reviewed the acts of the legislature and the con - struction, placed upon them by the various executive depart - ments of state for some twenty-six years, and held that, by reason of long continued, contemporaneous, and practical construction, the salary appropriation bill, which appro - priates an amount for the salary of a certain officer in excess of that fixed by the statute creating the office, governs, and that the auditor of public accounts is authorized to draw a warrant for the monthly or quarterly salary of such officer in accordance with the amount expressed in the appropria - tion bill. (Report &amp; Opinions of Attorney General for 1909- </seg>
            <seg id="p160">70 This department, in an opinion written by (Jeorge W. Ayres, deputy, cited the foregoing opinion and held that the bank examiners should receive salaries according to the appropriation bill rather than the statutory provisions fixing their salaries. This latter opinion was based largely upon a decision of the supreme court of the United States. which, in part, is as follows: "The Revised Statutes fix the annual salary of an interpreter at four hundred dollars. In 1877 Congress appropriated in gross for such offices 'at three hundred dollars per annum,' and repeated the appro - priation in like form down to and including the appropriation act of March 3rd, 1881. A. served as such interpreter from July, 1878, to November, 1882, and was paid at the rate of $300 per annum. In a suit to recover at the rate fixed by the Revised Statutes: Held, that Congress had expressed its purpose to reduce for the time being the salaries of interpreters, and that the claimant could not recover." (I nitetl siatix r. Mitchell. 109 U. S., 146.) While I have always had more or less doubt about what our own court would hold in matters of this kind, I am not disposed to overrule these prior decisions, and, hence, would advise that your department be governed by these rulings in all cases similar to the one under consideration. A somewhat different condition of facts surround the salary voucher of the deputy insurance commissioner. I do not find that the salary of the deputy insurance com - missioner has been fixed by statute, but that it has always been provided for by appropriation, and pay therefor has heretofore been at the rate of $1800 per annum. The ses - sion of the legislature which has just adjourned passed an act known as the insurance code, which takes the insurance department away from the auditor of public accounts, and provides for the organization of a board and certain offi - . among them an insurance commissioner. This act does not take effect until July 17, 1913. The legislature followed with an appropriation for the salaries of the officers created by this new insurance code, and this act contains an emer - gency clause. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">71 It is clear that the intention of the legislature was ti&gt; have the insurance commissioner assume the duties heretofore l&gt;erformed by the deputy insurance commissioner, he heini; a deputy under the department of the auditor of public accounts. The insurance code provides that the salary of insurance commissioner shall he sf'JoOO per annum. No appropriation was made by the legislature for the mainte - nance of the insurance department as it has heretofore been conducted. Hence, the question arises as to whether or not those carrying on the work of the insurance department at the present time shall be paid out of the appropriation made for carrying on the new department of insurant Our supreme court has passed upon a question very &gt;imi - lar to yours. The legislature of 1909 provided for a state public school for dependent children, to be located at the Home for the Friendless. This law did not become effect - ive until July 1, 1909. The appropriations made by the legislature in 1907, for the maintenance of the Home for the Friendless, and payment of the officers, terminated April 1, 1909. The legislature of 1909 did not make an appropriation referring in any way to the Home for the Friendless, but it provided in the appropriation made for the current expenses of the state government for the years ending March 31, 1910, and March 31, 1911. for the main - tenance of said state public school. The legislature evi - dently intended to change the name, but continue the insti - tution, of the Home for the Friendless. The court says: "It is incredible that the legislature intended to leave the dependent children and aged women in the Home for the Friendless without means of support for three months, and expected the employees and officers necessary for the transaction of the business of that institution to labor for the state three months without compensation, or, in default of such gratuitous services, that the institution should become a derelict during the second quarter of 1909. The appropriations for said school with the exception of the item for the placing out agent, \%hose office is created by Senate File No. 350, are identical as to officials and amounts with the appropriations made by the 1907 legis - lature for the Home for the Friendless. It certainly was not the inten- </seg>

The appropriations for the biennium, and yet, because the change in the name of institution will not become effective till July 1st, respondent ions that the money appropriated cannot be used in three out of months of the biennium. It is clear that the legislature appro - ited money to maintain the institution known as the Home for the &gt;ndless, which subsequent to July 1, 1909, will be described as the :e Public School for Dependent Children." fstatr t. Hartoii, 122 I^he legislature which has just adjourned has provided taking the insurance department out of the care and tody of the auditor of public accounts, for placing it ler a board, and for making it a separate department, to known as the insurance department. The duties here - )re performed by the auditor of public accounts, so far insurance is concerned, are continued, but a change has n made in the name and in the manner of conducting the •artment. IJy analogy it would follow, therefore, that the same rule iuld be applied in payment of the salaries of those per - ming those duties as was applied in the case quoted &gt;ve.

Under section 71(51, Cobbey'a Annotated Statutes of 1911, all persons who sell or give away liquors upon any pretext, without having obtained a license, are guilty of a misde - meanor. It is clear that C. did not sell this liquor, neither did he give it away. He merely acted as the agent for the minors in securing it. The supreme court, however, has held that the selling of liquor without a license is the transfer and disposal of the liquor itself. (Harding r. State, 65 Xeh., 239.) In that case, the agent received the money and sent it to Omaha with an order for fhe liquor, which was expressed to the purchaser. It was held that the sale was consummated in the delivery of the liquor to the common carrier. Facts somewhat similar app—r in Skihs r.

He has aided 1 abetted the sale of this liquor, by a licensed dealer, to minors. This crime being a misdemeanor, there were accessories, all being principals. In Wagner r.

Nebraska State Railicay Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Bentlemen: Your communication of the 8th instant is ollows: Ifhe village of Belden, Cedar County, Nebraska, owns and makes of a 'dumping ground,' which is outside of the corporation limits across the tracks of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. Co. "This 'dumping ground' is reached at present by means of an estab - lished crossing over the Burlington tracks. After passing over the crossing, and in order to reach the 'dumping ground,' it is necessary at present to drive through privately owned property for a distance of perhaps 500 feet. The village teamsters have no right to pass through this private property, but are permitted to do so by sufferance. P'he 'dumping ground' is immediately adjacent to the Burlington : of way. The village authorities desire the Burlington Railroad pany to install another crossing, about 500 feet away from the ?nt crossing, which proposed crossing would lead immediately into 'dumping ground.' KI am directed to ask of you an opinion in writing, as to whether lot, under the circumstances as stated, this commission has author - to compel the C. B. &amp; Q.

Our supreme court has held that the railway cwmiimion did not have the power to order in railroad crossings in cities and villages. {Chicajo, Rock Island &amp;. Pacific Ry. Co. v.

The railway commission act confers the power upon the commission to examine into and inspect the condition of each railway or common carrier, its equipment, and the manner of its con - duct and management with regard to the public safety and convenience in this state. Io far as our court has expressed itself, I am led to the elusion that the commission's authority is rather one of •ection of such railway crossings as have already been stmcted and the ordering of repairs thereon, so as to ce the same safeguard the lives of passengers, employees, the public generally. (Chicago, Rock island &amp; Pacific Co. v.

The facts disclosed in your letter do not show any public road crossing at the point where the railroad crossing is required. Neither do they show there has been any private paeaage way crossing the railroad company's right of way at that point. Hence, the above provision might not be held applicable to this state of facts. In any event, had the railway commission the power to order in the crossing asked for, its order would not be final in case the railroad company refused to comply therewith, but its order would have to be enforced by a court proceed - ing. Our courts, in a number of cases, have held that where a railroad crossing or facility is necessary, and it is incum - beut upon the railroad company to provide the same, an action in mandamus may be commenced to compel it to </seg>

In case the mission should order the company to place in the croae-« askel for, it would have first to find it was a neceoeary reasonable facility. That natter would be subject to sal; then, in case the company refused to comply with the sr, an action would have to be brought to enforce it- - pliance therewith. This delays .1 proceeding of this 1 for several years in spite of all thai can he done. Khere is much doubt as to whether or not the request placing in this crossing at a point within 500 feet of a liar railroad crossing can he sustained in any court, as ■ssary and reasonable under the circumstances. In view of the uncertainty of the right of the commission to order in the crossing, under the decisions of our court, I think this matter is one that should be litigated by the village against the railroad company by mandamus in the district court of Cedar county. A much more expeditions determination of the question could be secured thereby. Very respectfully, GRANT G. MARTI X. May !), 1913. Attorney General. Occupation Tax — Payment. Since the new occupation tax law does not go into effect until July 17, 1913, and the old occupation tax law provides such taxes shall be paid on or before July 1 of each year and shall become delin - quent September 20 of each year, corporations have the right to make payment of their occupation taxes under the schedule of fees prescribed by the old law up to July 17, and thereafter are required to pay under the provisions of the new law.

Inasmuch as the new law. House Roll 752, goes into effect July 17, and expressly repeals the prior law, it makes it somewhat difficult to determine just in what manner the collection of occupation taxes shall be carried on in your department. I see no way to escape the conclusion that all corporations, desiring to comply with the law as it now exists, would have the right to make payment of their occu - pation taxi's under the schedule of fees prescribed thereby up to July 17, 1913. At that time the new law, House Roll 7")ii, goes into effect, and it provides a new schedule of fees. Corporations, domestic and foreign, who have not paid under the old law at that time, should be required to pay under the provisions of the new law, which goes into effeel on that date. I would suggest that your department make a statement, together with a form of report required by the new law, and furnish such statement to each corporation doing bosilMM in this state, advising each that it will be entitled to pay under the old law up to July 17, but in case it refuse- to pay at that time it will be required to pay under the pro - visions of the new law, which takes effect on that date.

K'he pharmacy law provides, among other things, as ows: "Any person, not being a registered pharmacist, who shall take charge of or act as manager of such pharmacy or store, or who, not being a registered pharmacist, shall retail, compound, or dispense drugs, poisons, or medicines of any kind shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor." (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, sec. 9848.) I^liis provision of the law might seem, upon Hist thought, limit the sale of all the articles named in your letter opt by registered pharmacists. All or most of these ides might be called drugs, medicines, or poisons, 1 nk it is true that most of these articles are now being sold letail in this state by retailers who are not resist uniacists. Many of them are indispensable articles of a nil grocer's stock. In order to answer your question it is necessary for n divide it, and it is necessary to look into the pharmacy and </seg>
            <seg id="p170">80 Ie food statutes to determine the intent of the legislature naking the prohibition quoted above. The title to the rmacy act is the following: "An act to regulate lite ctice of pharmacy and sale of poisons, and prevent adul - ition in drugs and medicinal preparations in the state Nebraska, and to provide a penalty therefor." Pharmacy lefined as the art or business of compounding and dis - cing medicines. It treats of the compounding of drugs other substances for use in medicine. I take it that the legislature, in passing an act for the llation of the practice of pharmacy, intended to regulate compounding and dispensing of medicines. The legis - re thereby would protect the people of the state from compounding or sale of drugs and medicines for medic - purposes in the hands of those who were ignorant or of their properties. It could not have been the nt of the legislature to control and prevent the sale of cles of merchandise not intended for use as medicine. Imong the articles mentioned by you are ammonia, biear - ate of soda, borax, olive oil, cream of tartar, pepper, oring extracts, sal-ammoniac, sal-soda, baking powders, stuffs, and sage, which rarely, if ever are used in medi - m but are most extensively used in the mechanic arts for domestic purposes, such as cleaning, cooking, etc. onstruction that the pharmacy act prohibits the sale of *e articles intended in no way for medicines, by any other n a registered pharmacist, would, in my opinion, be cing the act broader than its title. It is true, some of these articles just named are classed as drugs. The pure food act, which may be considered in con - nection with the pharmacy act, says that the term drugf "shall include all medicines and preparations recognized in the United States Pharmacopoeia or National Formulary for the internal or external use, and any substance or mix - ture of substances intended to be used for the cure, mitiga - tion, or prevention of disease of either man or animals." </seg>
            <seg id="p171">81 Under this definition of drug, and under tho definition of the practice of pharmacy, it seems clear to me thai the legislature did not intend to give to registered pharmacists the sole right of sale of these articles which are extensively ■sod in the mechanic arts and for household purposes and to little, or no, extent used in the compounding of medicine-.. The pharmacy law plainly puts into the hands of the n tered pharmacists the sale of poisons. This office has formerly held that the law docs not control the sale of poisonous fly paper. (Report &amp; Opinions of Attorney Gen - eral for 1901-1902, p. 70.) This opinion was probably written with the idea in mind that the fly paper tu a patent or proprietary substance, such medicines or substances being excluded from the act in the following language: "Nothing in this act shall prevent any wholesale or retail dealers in any business from selling any patent or proprietary medicines, nor any resident registered physician from dispensing his own medicines on his own prescriptions." (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes for 1911, sec. 9849.) I 'his last quoted section would permit the sale of patent proprietary medicines or preparations, such as stock dips, powders, fly papers, and insect powders named in your er. All of these articles are for the removal of parasites, diseases caused by parasites, upon animals and fowls. ■ fact that these substances are patented or proprietary heir nature, are prepared and sold in package form, and for the prevention or removal of diseases by the killing he parasites, leads me to believe it was the intent of the slature, in section 9849, to permit their sale by a retail ler in any business. In the list submitted by you there are certain articles which seem fundamentally to belong to the drug stock, such as camphor, castor oil, glycerine, licorice, saltpetre, sulphur, sweet spirits of nitre, parairoiic. and senna leave-. All of these articles are used in the preparation of medicines. </seg>

In the latter opinion above cited the holding was to the effect that a lease in the hands of the lessee, upon which the stipu - lated rent had been paid, was property within the meaning of our revenue law and subject to taxation. The assessor will, of course, have to use his own judgment in placing a value upon these leasehold interests. Probably in most eases a fair method will be to include, for the pur of assessment, the value of all improvements on the leased premises helonging to the lessee, and to add thereto the amount of the rent stipulated to be pfiici i)er annum </seg>

Dear Sir: In your letter of the 9th instant you call my attention to section 18, chapter 8, Compiled Statutes of 1911, relating to banks. fnder the provisions of this section and other sections of banking law, banks are required to make reports stating, By GEORGE W. AYRES, </seg>
            <seg id="p177">87 Kmir other tilings, the amount of their re-discounts and amount of commercial paper past due. Said section IS odes the following pro vision: r'ommercial paper not in process of collection six months past due, demand paper carried one year with interest unpaid, shall not be included in the report of the assets of such corporation Your inquiries are two: E Under this provision, would the payment on the principal of te six months or more past due, sufficient to pay the interest to make a bankable asset of it without a payment designated at est?" Ki. Should paper that has run past the maturity date, but upon h a partial payment of the principal has been made sufficient to the interest to date, or upon which the interest has been paid to , be considered past due?" Ieferring to the provision, above quoted, in section 18, Bret question to be determined is whether the words tli interest unpaid" modify the words "commercial er" as well as the words "demand paper." Prom the ctuation and grammatical construction of the above ted piovision, I would be inclined to hold that the words th interest unpaid" apply only to "demand paper" not to "commercial paper." Hut, you have called my ntion to the law as it existed prior to the incorporation i it of that clause "demand paper carried one year with rest unpaid." ts the law originally existed, it related only to coinnier - paper and was worded as follows: "Commercial paper not in process of collection six months past due, with interest unpaid." Calling to my aid the old law, in interpreting the law as it now exists, I think I am justified in construing the words "with interest unpaid" to apply to "commercial paper" as well as to "demand paper." So that, when the int&lt; bees paid on commercial paper not in procew of collec - tion six months i)ast due such luivinent of interest would </seg>
            <seg id="p178">88 revive such commercial paper so as to make it an asset of tlic hank, which should properly be reported as an asset. When demand paper has been carried for one year, with interest unpaid, it ceases to he an asset which can be report - ed by the bank; bat, when the interest on such demand paper baa been paid, the payment of the interest revives the demand paper and makes it an asset of the bank proper to be reported. In answer to your first question will say that a payment the principal of a note six months past due. sufficient imonnt to pay the interest to date, would make said note inkable asset even though the payment is not designated nterest. Er supreme court lias held that partial payments made a debt drawing interest should first be applied in pay - of the interest and afterwards (o the reduction of the •ipal. {MUls v. Satmders, 4 Neb., 190.) A different rule applies to partial payments on a note drawing more than the legal rate of interest. Such pay - ments are to be applied to the principal. (Hall v. First National Bank of Fair field, 30 Neb., 90.) Ii answei to your second question will say that commer - paper which has ran past the maturity date, but uj&gt;on ch a partial payment of the principal has been made, icient in amount to pay the interest to date, or upon ch the interest has been paid to date, should be consid - 1 an asset of the bank, but should also be considered t due paper, which the banks are required to report as i. In other words, a payment of the interest on com - cial paper, after it has once become due, does nothing e than leinstate it as an asset of the bank which still ains past due, and should be so listed.

Should the owner of a tax sale certificate, purchased before this law went into effect, in paying subsequent taxes, pay simply that portion taxed to the legal owner or should he pay the entire amount of the taxes which are a lien against the land, including both the </seg>
            <seg id="p182">92 taxes against the mortgagee and that against the holder of the legal title?" El. Should the treasurer, in selling land for taxes on the first of smber next, sell the whole amount of the taxes for 1912, includ - the amount of taxes levied against the mortgagee and the amount &gt;d against the owner of the legal title, or should the taxes levied nst each be sold separately?" The mortgage law of 1911 vras evidently passed for the purpose of enabling the taxing authorities to get at the real estate mortgages and to secure a method by which they might be taxed and the taxes assessed thereon collected, as well as to prevent what was commonly n gnized to be double taxation to the owners of lands upon which there wcii' mortgage encumbrances. i'nder th" old law, the owner was compelled to pay a tax n the full value of the land, even though it was encuin - i'd by a mortgage for a large part of its actual worth. i&lt;e. for the purposes of assessment and taxation, the of 1911 deflated mortgages on real estate to be an inter - in the real estate which secured the same. Before the sage of this law. in theory the mortgage was regarded i lien on real estate, and in a certain sense was recognised m interest in the real estate. But, this new law expressly lair- it to be an interest in real estate. When there is no provision in the mortgage requiring the mortgagor to pay the tax on the mortgage, the tax is -sell agai— 1 the mortgagee or his assigns, and the tax levied thereon is a lien on the mortgage interest. The excess value of the lands, above the mortgage thereon, is Bsed and taxed to the owner and is a lien on his interesl in the land. The mortgagee is permitted to pay the tax levied on the interest of the owner of the land, and when he does so he has a lien on the owner's interest to the extent of the amount of tax so paid, with lawful interest thereon. The mortgagor or owner of the land is also, by the law, author - ized to pay the tax levied on the mortgage interest, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p183">93 trnnt of such tax so paid may be offset against any inter - accruing upon the mortgage indebtedness, This law expressly provides that in case of non-payment of any tax levied upon the interest of the owner or the mort - gagee or his assigns, the land upon which the tax is unpaid may be sold in the same manner provided by law for the sale of real estate for delinquent taxes, and the holder of either the mortgage interest or the owner's interest may redeem from such sale the interest sold. I'rom these provisions, it would follow that the owner a tax sale certificate, purchased even before thi&gt; law it into effect, but who wishes to pay the subsequent es, as by law provided, should pay the taxes on both the rtgage interest and the owner's interest. In answer to vour second question I will Bay that the county treasurer, in making his tax sales in the month of November, should include both the amount of tax levied against the mortgage interest as well as that levied airainst the OWBer'fl interest. In doing this, it, no doubt, would be advisable for him to offer for sale these interests separately, as they are assessed separately, although it would be wise for the purchaser, owing to the manner in which he i&gt; required to proceed, to see to it that he purchases both interests. Both interests might be included in one certifi - cate, but a separate statement should be made of the amount of tax levied against each interest. I suggest this for the reason that the owner of either interest, under this law, is authorized to redeem from the sale of the int. so sold. LVery respectfully, __ay 24, 1913. (JKAXT &lt;i. MARTIN.

            <seg id="p186">96 Irhere is a mercantile corporation in this county that has a capital k of $50,000, with a paid up capital of $25,000; this paid up tal consists of merchandise and real estate, but ttie manager of concern only puts in $16,000 as the value, claiming that the goods ; depreciated. Now, the question is, is this an investment com - f? If so, is it not the duty of the assessor to assess the merchan - and real estate at their true value, and then add the difference ,-een that and the paid up capital? "There is a lumber corporation in this county that shows, by its prticles of incorporation, it has a paid up capital of $32,000; yet the manager of the company says that at the time of incorporation it con - sisted of two lumber yards and that since said time one of the lumber yards has been sold in the amount of $12,000 leaving only $20,000. The question again is, should the capital stock be assessed?" In considering the questions propounded by you, it is asary to bear in mind the provision* of the organic law of the state Section 1, article 0. constitution, reads, in part, as follows: E'he legislature shall provide such revenue as may be needful, by ng a tax by valuation, so that every person and corporation shall a tax in proportion to the value of his, her, or its property and :hises." It is apparent, I think, from the above quoted provision :he constitution, that each of the corporations to which i refer should pay tax upon the value of its property in same proportion that an individual pays, and should ■ no more. If the entire capital of the mercantile cor - ation, to which you refer, is invested in merchandise and 1 estate, such merchandise and real estate being assessed other property, at its fair valuation, it would seen t no more could be asked. That valuation may be either ater or less than the authorized or even paid in amount of Ital stock. What the assessor should strive to do is to get at the real value of the property of the corporation. Take the case of the lumber corporation; if it has no property, other than the one lumber yard, and if the assessor has the true value of the lumber yard and assesses it at one-fifth of its value, </seg>
            <seg id="p187">97 In it would seem the corporation should pay no other tax. :, it may be it has other property; that is to say, the |&gt;oratioii may have money deposited in the hank to the mnt for which it sold its one lumber yard, or it may have otiable instruments given in payment of same. In any nt the corporation should pay in one form or another in the real value of its property, just as a private indi - ual does. iiVhile the statutory provisions, regarding the taxation corporations of this character, are not so definite per - is as they might be, yet it occurs to me that their capital ck may be assessed by a method analogous to the method &gt;vided by section 10065, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes 1911. tdo not wish to be understood as holding that these cor ations are of the kind expressly covered by the provi - is of said section 108S&amp; I think they are not, but I ik that the provisions of said section, when applied to ir taxation, are eminently fair and just. tn a comparatively recent case.

Construing the several provisions of the revenue law together, and taking them in connection with the provision of the constitution hereinbefore quoted, it would seem that the just and fair method of taxing corporations, such as those mentioned by you, is to assess their real estate and merchandise at one-fifth of their actual value, just as similar property owned by individuals is taxed. If such corpora - tions have any other tangible property, such as notes or credits, that should also be assessed. If the capital stock of such corporations is of greater value than the aggregate value of the specific property, both real and personal, assessed to it, then such surplus should be taxed at the home office or principal place of doing business of the corpora - tions. I do not think that the amount of the authorized, or even the paid in, capital stock of a corporation is ■ con - trolling factor in such a case. The gist of the whole matter is to determine, its actual value, and if the actual value is in excess of the value of the various specific items of prop - erty assessed to it, then it should be assessed upon such excess, but not otherwise.

Entrekin, county assessor of Hamilton county, and have requested an opinion upon the quest ion&gt; therein propounded. I note from Mr. Entrekin 's letter that an elevator com - ly in his countv had on hand, on April 1, 191.*$, about 100 bushels of wheat and some corn; that it claims to e sold all but about 16,000 bushels of this grain, and ised to state who was the purchaser; and that when it lined its schedule it was made out to show the aver capital invested in the business during the year. B« uires what is the intent of the law in the matter of the I'ssinent of grain elevators. E'he provision of statute providing for the MMMDMll of in elevators is found in section (&gt;(&gt;, article 1, chapter 77, npiled Statutes for 1911, which reads as follows: "Every person, company or corporation engaged in the business of buying and selling grain for profit, shall be held to be a grain broker, and shall, at the time required by this act, determine under oath the pverage amount of capital invested in such business for the preceding year, and taxes shall be charged upon such average capital the same an on other propertj. Real estate and all other tangible property shall be assessed separately. 'Tangible property' shall not apply to or include grain on hand. 'Average capital' shall include all grain pur - rnased during the year whether the same has been sold or is still on hand at the time of assessment. For the purpose of determining the cverage capital of such grain broker the county assessor or precinct assessor shall have the right to inspect all books of account and the check books of such grain broker and shall determine and fix the amount of such capital by such inspection." I lie part of said section which provides that "tangible perty shall not apply to or include grain on hand; aver - capital shall include all grain purchased during the r, whether the same has been sold or is still on hand at time of a&gt;-cs&gt;ment" was added to the section in 1909. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">100 t&gt;r to that time the supreme court had held, in construing law applicable to the assessment of elevators, that: I Average capital is the average of the amount of cash and all other perty of every kind used in carrying on the business; and. if there a excess of this average of capital over the amount of real estate other tangible property that can be viewed by the assessor, then i excess is to be added for assessment."

Ionstruing the law as it now exists and the above quoted agraph of the syllabus in case of Central (Ira tunics Co. anrastcr County, supra, it occurs to me that the assessor have a right, so long as the company will not disclose name of the party to whom it sold a part of the grain in elevator, in arriving at the average amount of capital doyed in the business of this company during the year, ake into account the 35,000 bushels of grain it had on d in its elevator on April 1, 1913. If he changes the 'ssment from the schedule furnished by the company, ink he should give it notice in order that it may appear show why the change should not be made. But, it would seem to me that, if it does appear and make such showing, it will be necessary for it to point out who, other than itself, is the owner of grain in its elevator. It certainly would not be a very good showing upon its part to insist that it owns only a part of the grain in its elevator but refuses to give the name of the other owner. If the company satisfies the assessor that it was not the owner of all the grain in its elevator on April 1, 1913, then he will take that fact into account in determining the amount of average capital employed in the business, but, unless he is so satisfied, I think he has a right to regard all of the grain in the elevator as belonging to the company, and to deter - mine the amount of the average capital employed by it in the business accordingly.

You inquire when these lands became taxable as real estate, and call the attention of this department to section 33, article 1, chapter 77, Compiled Statutes of 1911, which provides: KAny lands taken and held under the homestead or preemption laws, .ny other land laws of the United States, shall be subject to full tax - n as soon as the holder thereof shall become entitled to make final sf of his claim." In answer to your question I will say that, when said section was originally passed, any one having a claim upon government land, as a homesteader or preemptor, could secure a patent to same at a merely nominal expense, upon making final proof of his residence for the required time. The intent of the law evidently was to make lands subject to taxation whenever the owner acquired title thereto, or could acquire title at his own option. t&gt; T here irrigated lands are entered under the reclamation of June 17, 1902, something more is necessary than mere (fence and proof thereof to entitle the one making such y to a patent. Under the original provisions of the act, se taking such lands as homesteads were not entitled patent until the full cost of the irrigation project appor - ied to the land had been paid. Ii 1912, however, an act was passed which allowed the testead entryman on such lands, upon proof of residence the required time, and upon payment of such part of expense of the irrigation project apportioned to said 1 as might be due at that time, to secure a patent to the I. Since that date, parties who have resided on such Is for the requisite time may, upon making proof of such dence, and upon payment of the amount due the govern - it for irrigation costs, obtain patents to their land.

The question is as follows: I)o the words 'when no commission or other compensation of any acter whatsoever' is to move in the transaction, and no publicity led in accomplishing the sale,' at the conclusion of said paragraph e referred to, apply to Nebraska corporations already in existence, •aska corporations hereafter created, and corporations of other w, which have been in existence five years or more and the major - if whose officers are citizens of this state, or do said words have [cation only to the sales of securities owned by the seller prior to taking effect of this act, when purchased by such seller prior to :h 1, 1913?" The grammatical construction of this subdivision b indi - cates that the words, "when no commission or other com - pensation etc.," are intended to modify the clause imme - diately preceding it, which relates to the sales of securities owned by the seller prior to the taking effect of this act. f Ordinarily statutes are construed in accordance with the al rules of grammatical construction, but this rule is not owed when it clearly appears that the legislature had a erent intention. It is difficult to determine what was the a legislative intent concerning this matter. Our supreme rt has held: "A proviso should be construed as referring to what immediately precedes it only, unless a different intention is apparent from the act itself." (School DWrM r.

(BtmH r. srhnffer, 104 V., 139.)

Under this act, when a foreign corporation accepts the provisions of the general corporation laws of the state, it is declared to be a body corporate of tiis state, and, hence, is entitled to all of the privileges contemplated by the cor - poration laws of the state. The last session of the legislature passed what is now known as the "Blue Sky" law.

It would seem from this that the legislature intended to define the class of foreign corporations which are exempt from its provisions, and to limit them to the class \vlio&gt;e stockholders and officers were citizens of this state. Infer - entially, it would follow that corporations organized in other states, which were not of this class, would nut be entitled to exemption from the provisions of the Blue sky These considerations lead me to conclude that a corpora - tion organized in ■ sister state, although it has become domesticated under the provisions of section 41."&gt;7. above quoted, is not entitled to exemption from the application of this act.

This is the construction usually given to similar statutes, unless a different intention may be clearly drawn from the subdivision or act itself. Inas - much as other parts of this same subdivision exempt foreign coi porations which have been in existence five years or more, and the majority of whose stockholders and officers were at the time of commencing business, and at the date of the approval of this act, citizens of the state of Nebraska, it would seem that the legislature did not intend to include Nebraska corporations already in existence at the time of the passage and approval of the act, else it would have M expressed itself.

While subdivision 1, section 1, of said act, defines the word "dealer" and makes the same applicable to every individual who sells or attempts to sell, within the state, any stocks, bonds, or other securities of any kind or character whatso - ever, it must be observed that section 2, of said law, classi - fies those persons, companies, and dealers who are subject to the provisions of the act, and expressly exempts from its provisions dealers and others who sell, or negotiate for sale, </seg>

However, oes not seem to me that a fair interpretation of thi&gt; law ild require ■ "dealer" to secure a permit and pay a use therefor in order to lawfully sell securities which designated by section 4 as exempt from the provisions he law.

"Section 1 1 of the law reads as follows: " 'Sec. 11. Before offering or attempting to sell any securities to any person or persons, except to a "dealer" as herein defined, or to a corporation, or offering to do any business whatever in this state or with a person residing in this state, excepting that of preparing the documents hereinafter required, every "company selling its own secur - ities" shall comply with the following requirements:' B Among the requirements referred to by this section is subdivision . liii-h reads as follows: ■ 'g.

            <seg id="p212">122 rule would not apply. "An early reply to this inquiry will be appreciated." i'his department lias heretofore held that subdivision g, tion 11, requires that each share of stock sold or offered sale, by every "company selling its own securities." II be of the par value of $1(K), and that every such com - y shall comply with that requirement, as well as a num - of others mentioned in said section 11. Ender the provisions of section 3, dealers who make sales ?curities to other dealers, or to corporations, arc exempt l the provisions of this act. Knder section 12 of the act, every "dealer" is required to ply with certain provisions. As stated by you, subdivision g, of said section 11, rela - tive to the par value of stocks, is not included among these requirements to be complied with by a dealer. Hence, it follows that the answer to your question may be determined by the fact as to whether a dealer could l»e successfully I unsecured if lie saw fit to offer for sale stocks or securities, the par value of whose shares was made less than $1(M) each. This not being one of the requirements prescribed by law for a dealer to comply with, a dealer who had come into • ssion of shares of stock, the par value of which was fixed at less than $100 each, could not be successfully prose - cuted for offering to sell or selling the same. It may be argued that this would enable a "company selling its own securities" to circumvent the law by selling the same to a dealer, and then permitting the dealer to sell to the public. II this be true, it is the fault of the law and cannot be avoided, although it is doubtful whether such a company as denned in this act could transfer its own stocks to a "dealer" so as to successfully avoid the requirement rela - tive to par value of its shares of stock.

Reed, special Maminer of the Nebraska State Railway Commission's "Blue Sky Department,' I am directed by the commission to ask of you an opinion in writing as to the legal effect of certain words contained in paragraph b, of section 11, of the 'Blue Sky' law, which paragraph reads as follows: K 'Receive a permit from the commission, which shall be for one , and which shall be issued only upon the payment of the fee for examination and report, which shall be $25 for the first year, and per year thereafter, and a permit for each agent, the fee for issuing :h shall be $1 per year.' Irhe reasons calling for this interpretation are as follows: Between date of the passage of the 'Blue Sky' law and the date of its becom - effective, two corporations were organized in this state and applied he 'Blue Sky' department for a permit to issue their securities, ng into the department the required fee of $25 for examination report. After said applications had been examined and report lered thereon, an interpretation of certain provisions of the law made by the attorney general which relieved these companies i taking out a permit. The money collected was paid into the e treasury, as required by law, prior to the ruling of the attorney ml upon the question involved. These companies are now asking a return of the fee paid by them. KAn opinion from you is, therefore, desired, first, as to whether or these fees should be returned under the facts as herein set forth, , second, whether or not it is possible to return said fees after the e have been paid into the state treasury." IJnder the provisions of the law referred -to by you, the riieant for ;i permit is required to file a statement of its incial condition, copies of contracts, statement of the leral plam of its business, copies of securities to be ■led for sale, and still other information concerning the ails of the business to be conducted by the applicant. It ■n devolves upon the commission to make an examination the data so submitted, and to determine therefrom as to ether or not the company should receive a permit to do siness in the state, under the provisions of this act. For this examination and report by the commission, a fee i&gt; required to be paid by the applicant When this fee for such examination and report is paid, the commission is anthoriaed to issue a permit to the applicant to do business lor the first year. Taking all these provisions into consideration, it appears </seg>

In case the com - lion, after making the examination, should fiad tliat t lie licant ought not to receive a permit, the commission ild still l&gt;e entitled to the fee for the examination, and, re, would not be required to return it. Especially would be true when the commission had received the fee and led it into the state treasury.

Frequently, the courts have been called upon to consider tlio word "relatives" in the interpretation of wills, and they have uniformly held this word to include only relationship! of consanguinity. But, our legislature seems to have used this word in its widest popular sense, and in that sense it is held to include relations by affinity as well as by blood. The purpose of the legislature was to prevent the custom, which has become prevalent in some departments and insti - tutions of the state, for the heads thereof to permit the employment of relatives, either of blood or of marriage rela - tionship. The latter part of the law, hereinbefore quoted, indicates to my mind that it was used in the popular sense, because it expressly authorizes the chief executive officer of any institution to employ his wife or one relative, when K board shall find that such for the position. employee i&gt; specially quali- E[ence, I conclude that this se as in the case of Marcus ?rein it is said: "There can be no doubt that a brother-in-law comes within the recognized and well-settled meaning of the word 'relative.'

I^his grant does not appear in the least ambiguous. It •ports to grant to the man of foreign birth, who, conform - y to the laws of the United States on the subject of natu - ization, has declared his intention to become a citizen, the lit to vote. The legislature cannot impair this right of I class of voters. As soon as they have, in a proper court, en the proper oath, they are voters, under our consti - ion.

The nty hoard is also authorized to make a levy each year. to exceed one mill on each dollar of ■anrnnrd valuation ►roperty in the county, and the amount realized there- D shall he set apart and designated as the "county gging fund" and shall he expended only for the purpose hanging the roads. The last part of said section 1. of 1 House Holl Xo. 288, is ;is follows: "Provided, the provisions of this act shall not apply to any county or portion of any county if the county board thereof shall by majority vote decide that it will not be practicable for the county to adopt said system, and that the roads of such county cannot be improved by dragging on account of natural conditions or the excessive amount of sand, rock, or gravel of which said roads are composed." Your question, in substance, is: Is it discretionary with the county board to refuse to adopt said sys - tem, irrespective of the fact whether or not the roads of said county can or cannot be improved by dragging? This act is in effect, and has been since its approval, in all the counties of the state. The provision, referred to by you and quoted herein, affords the opportunity to the county board to in a sense suspend the law, so far as the county in question is concerned. In order to suspend the provisions of the law, the county board shall, by a majority vote, decide two things: First, that it will not be practicable for the countv to adopt this dragging svstem: Second, that </seg>
            <seg id="p224">134 1 roads of the county cannot be improved by dragging, account of natural conditions or the excessive amount sand, rock, or grave] of which sai ' roads are composed. These matters may be determined by the county board on a hearing, if it sees tit, or they may be determined by the county board by reason of its general knowledge of the con - ditions of the county. When the county board makes a find - ing, which includes both of these things, that finding would have the effect to take the county out of the provisions of the act and entirely exempt it therefrom. These findings of the board, by a majority vote, would, in my judgment, be final, unless they were reversed by recourse to the courts. It is doubtfvd whether error proceedings might be prosecuted from the county board, on findings of this kind, to the dis - trict court. It seems that our court has held similar i|ues - tions to be of a govornmentiil or rdministrative character and not subject to judicial cognizance. [Dodge Countff r. Aeom, b'l Neb*, 37b"; Tyson r. Washington County, 7S Xeb., 211.) In the event that error proceedings could be taken, it would be necessary for the record to contain a full and complete bearing on the questions involved. If course, it is the duty of the county board, in ease of a nal hearing, or on an independent investigation, to these questions on the conditions in the county they exist and from the evidence disclosed. Coiise - ntlv, the countv board should not refuse to proceed under : law, unless it first finds and decides, by a majority vote, t the dragging system is impracticable and that the roads not be improved by dragging on account of natural con ons, or on account of excessive sand, rock, or gravel nd in their composition.

This act baa bun frequently questioned, for the reasoa that the journals of the legislature arc silent M to -oino steps necessaiy to the passage of the hill. It has been &gt;ome time since 1 examined the journals as to this act. but my recollection is clear that it was the journal of the &gt;cnate which was silent as to the adoption of an amendment by the house. The law on such a question is plainly stated in Stettt State, 77 Xeb., 777, which was a conviction coming from VOW county. In said case it was held that the enrolled hill, bearing the signature of the legislative officers and approved by the governor, is printa facie evidence of its Mge, and that silence on the part of the legislative jour - nals as to any of the steps necessary to its passage i* not Sufficient to overthrow that evidence.

Dear Sir: 1 have yours of the Nth instant, which i- ai GRANT (J. MART IX. </seg>
            <seg id="p227">137 ■I would like an opinion from your department on the following ters: "1. This village owns its water plant, water is furnished each per - son that desires it at so much per quarter, and it seems the village has passKl an ordinance that delinquent water rent may be certified to the county clerk for him to place on the tax-list to be collected as a tax on the real estate of the delinquent. Is it not a fact that an ordinance of this kind is void? M l. Has the county board authority under section 6099, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, to divide a sinele road district into two separate districts, or does there have to be a certain number of road districts in each township?" I "lie first question submitted by you is not strictly one in wliicli this department is required to give an opinion. •elate&gt; to the government of tin- village, and I take it t the advice of this department, under the law, when ctly construed, is limited to state officers and to county irneys on questions of public revenue and criminal pro - ore. This question can hardly be considered one of pub - revenue, although it relates to a matter of taxation for cr rentals in a village. I think the answer to your first question is governed by the &gt;tatute which confers power npon cities and villages to establish water systems therein, and provides for the bor - rowing of money and the issuance of bonds therefor. A por - tion of section 8927, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes for 1911, leads as follows: "The council or board of trustees of such cities and villages, shall have power to make and enforce all needful rules and regulations in the erection, construction, use and management of such water works, mains, portion or extension of any system of water works or water uupply. and for the use of the water therefrom, and such cities and villages shall have the right and power to tax. assess and collect from the inhabitants thereof such tax, rent, or rates for the use and benefit of wattr used or supplied to them by such water works, mains, portion or tx elision of any system of water works or water supply as the council or board of trustees shall deem just or expedient; and all such water rates, taxes, or rents shall be a lien upon the premises, or leal estate, upon or for which the same is used or supplied; and such taxes, rents or rates shall be paid and collected and such lien enforced </seg>
            <seg id="p228">138 in such manner as the council or board of trustees shall by ordinance direct and provide." Ihus, the statute expressly confers upon a village the it, hy ordinance, to make unpaid water rents a lien on property where the water is used, and provides that same may be enforced in the manner directed by ordi - ce duly passed l&gt;y the village authorities. It' the ordi - ee is regular in all particulars, it would seem the village the right to have the lien certified to the county clerk the tax collected as a lien against the real estate cted. IjMwering your second question will say the county rd is authorised hy law to divide the county into as many rl districts as may lie necessary, and to alter the bound - 's thereof as may seem proper, except that in no case 11 any road district he so constituted as to he within the its of two distinct voting precincts or townships in nties under township organization. (Cobbey's Anno - &gt;d Statutes of 1911, sec. &lt;&gt;09!&gt;.) I do not find any provi - 1 of law which requires a township to contain any stated nher of road districts, nor do I find any provision which liihits the comity hoard from dividing ;i road district ■ady established into two or more districts.

Section 9, of the same act, among other things, provides "All contracts, sales or purchases hereafter made for work to be done, or for anything to be sold or delivered or done, by weight or by measure, within this state, shall be taken and construed in terms of and according to the standards of weights and measures adopted by this act, except where parties have agreed upon any other calculations or measurements; and all statements and representations of any kind referring to the weights or measures of commodities sold or pur - chased, or exposed for sale, shall be understood in terms of the stand - ards of weights or measures aforesaid." (Revised Statutes of 1913, sec. 7525.) Construing the provisions of these two sections of the act together, it seems to me to be reasonably plain it was the legislative intent that, when Hour is sold in sacks, the packs shall conform in weight to the provisions of section ** fixing the weight of Hour in sacks, unless by a special eontrai agreement sacks of different weight are sold. It occurs to me that the safe way for one to do who i~ selling Hour by the sack, and desires to avoid any question as to the legality of his acts, is either to sell sacks containing the weights fixe;! by law. or to make a special contract or agreement with the purchaser to receive sacks containing a different weight.

Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb Kentlemen: Your inquiry of the 11th instant is as fol i: "Under our stock and bond law, can prosecution be sustained against a foreign corporation, organized under the laws of another state, which sells, or attempts to sell, within Nebraska, its stock or bonds without first securing from this commission authority for the issuance of such stock or bonds?" I 'lie act referred to by you. which deals with the subject Esuing stock and bonds, is sections .'!7, ."&gt;S, and .'!!&gt;. article hapter ~2. Compiled Statutes of 1911.

This act expressly restricts its provisions to such common carriers, or public service corporations, as are organized </seg>
            <seg id="p231">141 or incorporated under the laws of the state of Nebraska. It is likely this restriction \v:is an oversight on the part of the legislature. The legislature might have required foreign corporations owning public service properties in this state, which properties were used as a basis for the issuance of stock and bonds, to hare secured from your body authority for the issuance thereof before such stock and bonds would operate as liens upon their properties located in this state. However, when a prosecution is instituted and a com - plaint filed for a violation of this act, one of the essential allegations should necessarily be that the common carrier. cr public service corporation, is incorporated under the laws of this state. Even though it were the intention of the I. latnre to include foreign corporations, they are not regarded as included unless specifically mentioned, and a complaint or information, charging a violation of the law. cannot l»e aided by inference or the intention of the legislature. The proposition is elementary that a complaint or an informa - tion, charging a criminal offense, must explicitly state all Ibe essentials to constitute such offense under the law. that nothing can be interpolated therein, and that its averments will not be aided by intendment. (Hase r. Stuff, 74 Xel&gt;., I must not be overlooked that the provisions of ceetion chapter Hi. Compiled Statutes of 1911, provide the mer in which foreign corporations may become doOMsti - d in this state. This is done by filing with the secretary tate a copy of their articles of incorporation and a d copy of the resolution, adopted by their board - ctors accepting the provisions of this act, by means of eh, under the law, they become a body corporate of this e. When foreign corporations have done this, as is the I with some of the public carriers, they are to be regarded &gt;eing incorporated under the laws of this state. Bi such cases, I think they would be subject to the pro - ons of the stock and bond law referred to above, but </seg>
            <seg id="p232">142 foreign corporations which have not become domesticated, under the provisions of this latter act, could not be success - fully prosecuted for failure to procure an order of your body authorizing the issuance of their stock and bonds. It may be that foreign corporations will take advantage of this oversight on the part of the legislature and organize with a view of carrying on public service plants within this state, thereby avoiding the necessity of submitting their !-t(ick and bond issue to your body. If this be true, as no doubt it will be, I see no way to avoid it until the legislature has, in express terms, by some appropriate method, included within the stock and bond law foreign corporations which may undertake to carry on their line of business within the state, and own and operate plants therein.

Wife Right — Refund of Inheritance Tax. rre an inheritance tax lias been erroneously paid on an estate which descends to the surviving spouse of a deceased person, in lieu of dower, the county treasurer, on satisfactory proof thereof, may refund the amount so paid, provided that application for repayment is made within two years of the date of such payment. the inheritance tax fund becomes depleted, the county treasurer would not be justified in undertaking to make a repayment of an erroneous tax out of any other fund belonging to the county. rre there is not a sufficient amount in the inheritance tax fund to pay each claimant, the several demands should be paid in the order in which the claims have been presented. IV. Thomas, Esq., Count 1/ Attorney of Butler Count 1/, David Qity, Web.

Relative to this subject, you ask the following questions: Kl Is such a payment within the meaning and intent of said sec - 11210, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911. and should the &gt;unt so paid be refunded by the treasurer if demand be made there - within the limitation of said section?" E. If a proper matter to refund, the said fund being depleted. Id same be paid out of any other funds in the hands of the county urer?" Elf a proper matter for refund, but not payable out of any ' fund, should the several demands be paid in the order in which are filed, as fast as the county treasurer has money in said fund, ould the money be prorated among the several claimants?" A part of the syllabus of the decision of our supreme court, referred to by you, is as follows : "Chapter 23, Compiled Statutes of 1911, abolishing the estates of dower and curtesy, gives to the surviving spouse of a deceased per - son an enlarged estate of the same kind and nature as that of dower or curtesy, and such estate, like dower, is not subject to an inheri - tance tax." (ttrwkmm r. Wni/nr County, 142 N. W., 678.) Said section 11210, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, referred to by you, in substance, provides that when any amount of said tax shall have been paid erroneously it shall be lawful for the county treasurer, on satisfactory proof thereof, to refund and pay to the executor, administrator, or proper person who has paid such tax in error, the amount so paid, provided that application for repayment shall be made within two years of the date of such payment. According to the decision of the supreme court above referred to, an inheritance tax charged against that portion of the estate which goes to the wife in lieu of her dower, which might be characterized as the wife right, was errone - ously paid and should be so considered under the pro - visions of said section 11210. If application for refund thereof is made within the period of limitation, that is within </seg>
            <seg id="p234">144 refunded upon the submission of satisfactory proof. Under the provisions of section 11218, Cobbey's Anno - tated Statutes of 1911, this inheritance tax fund is required to be kept separate from other funds, and is in fact made a special fund, to be expended under the direction of the county board. If this fund becomes exhausted, the county treasurer would not be justified in undertaking to make a repayment of such erroneous tax out of any other fund belonging to the county. Such repayment should come out of the fund into which the original payments were made, and that, of course, is this special fund. Under these cir - cumstances, it would be nwwanary for the claimants to await the replenishing of this fund for such amounts as they would be entitled to by reason of having made erroneous payments into this special fund. Ifind no authority in law for prorating the amount due several claimants, where there is not a sufficient amount he fund to pay each claimant in full. The better course loniae would be for the treasurer to pay the claimants in order in which their claims have been presented. respectfully, GRANT Gh MARTIN, ■tober 22, 1913. Attorney General.

Inheritance Tax — Refund — Interest — Taxation. rest on an inheritance tax erroneously paid on an estate which descends to the surviving spouse of a deceased person, in lieu of dower, should not be allowed when such inheritance tax is refunded, unless the inheritance tax so paid includes interest provided by law, and in such case the total amount paid as the inheritance tax should be returned. ■ amount of one's indebtedness cannot be offset against the value at which his personal property is taxed. trge Losey, Esq., County Attorney of Franklin County, Bloomington, Neb. Kor Sir: I have yours of the 23rd instant, which is as ws: K would like an opinion from your department on the following ers: II. A widow paid an inheritance tax to the county treasurer ol county in 1911. In 1913 she filed her claim against the county the amount of the inheritance tax paid, together with interest for period of time named. Granting that under a late decision she can iver the amount of the principal, can she recover interest on the tunt, she not having made application to the county treasurer under ion 11210, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, for a refund of money paid erroneously?" i'2. A farmer lists his hogs and corn with the assessor, also his • improvements on farm. He now flies a claim against the county, ming double taxation, in this, that he owed for the improvements the farm and that when he sold his hogs and corn he paid for the •rovements. In a case of this kind, can he recover back from the nty the assessment on the amorot he claimed for indebtedness?" </seg>
            <seg id="p237">147 Inhere an inheritance tax has been paid on that part of property which actually passes to the wife of a deceased son, in lieu of her dower, the same should be refunded n application therefor has been made within two years he time of payment. Nothing appears in the statute to cate that interest should be figured on the amount of inheritance tax so paid, and for that reason I do not ik interest on the amount of such refund should be wed. Sometimes when the inheritance tax is paid, the amount of the payment includes the interest provided by law, and when this is the case, of course, the total amount paid as the inheritance tax is the amount which should be returned. In answer to your second question will say that, under ' decisions of our supreme court, the amount of one's lebtedness cannot be offset against the value at which personal property is taxed. A taxpayer has the right offset the amount which he owes against the amount of gross credits, except on money loaned, in order to arrive the amount of his net credits which are subject to taxa - n. But, this does not include the right to deduct the uunt of his debits from the value of his other personal )j)«&gt;rty. To illustrate, a taxpayer who owns a horse, and es a part of the purchase price therefor, is not allowed to set the amount which he owes on the horse against the lue at which the horse is taxed.

And such moneys so paid into the state treasury shall be withdrawn therefrom or paid out only upon the proper voucher and warrant." Inasmuch as the fees received for examination of trust companies are received by virtue of ■ statutory provision requiring their payment (Compiled Statutes of 1911, eh. Hi, 1^41 ), it would seem that they are among the feel required to he tinned into the state treasury by the above quoted provision of statute. This being true, the only question remaining is, can they be drawn out again to pay the examiners whose labors have earned them, without being specifically appropriated for that purpose. I do not think they can be, and, as I have been unable to find that the fund, or any part thereof, created by the payment of the examination fees of trust companies, been appropriated to pay the expenses of making &gt;uch examinations during the present biennittm, I am con - strained to believe that the right to use such fund for such purpose does not exist.

At the first meeting of the county board there - after, the board shall inquire into the matter, and, if it is found that the complaint is properly made, the board shall e an order to the county treasurer to refund said taxes. If the board finds that the grounds of the protest are not true, it shall issue an order to the county treasurer to dis - pose of the money the same as though it had not been paid under protest. An appeal may be taken from this decision in the same manner and within the same time as an appeal is taken from the action of the board in the allowance or disallowance of claims against the county. The county treasurer is required to retain such taxes until the case is finally determined upon appeal. IL second method for the recovery of taxes is provided said section when the tax, or any part thereof, is claimed je invalid for the reason it was levied or assessed for an gal or unauthorized purpose, or for any other reason ept as above designated. When the taxpayer has paid ler this subdivision of the statute, he may, at any time bin thirty days after such payment, demand the same writing from the treasurer, and, if the same shall not refunded within ninety days thereafter, he may sue the inty or other subdivision for the amount so demanded. In order to lay the foundation for an appeal under the first subdivision of the statute and under the first method referred to, it is necessary for the taxpayer to file a state - ment in writing with the county board within thirty days. Under the second subdivision and the second method referred to, it is necessary for the taxpayer to demand in writing, within thirty days after such payment, the return cf the taxes, and, if the same are not refunded tr him within </seg>
            <seg id="p241">151 ninety days thereafter, he thereby lays the foundation for a suit against the county or proper subdivision. To entitle the taxpayer to relief under either of said subdix i&gt;ions, he is required to bring himself within the provisions thereof. In case he fails to do this, within the limitations fixed by statute, the county treasurer should dispose of the taxes so paid in the same manner as if no protest or demand in writing had been made. In the case of City of South Omaha v. McGavock, 72 Neb., 384, our supreme court has said: "Where a statute grants a new remedy, and at the same time places a limitation of time within which the person complaining must act, the limitation is a limitation of the right as well as of the remedy, and, in the absence of qualifying provisions or saving clauses, the party seeking to avail himself of the remedy must bring himself strictly within the limitations.

            <seg id="p242">152 claim to the county board of your county for such expenses; and that the board refuses to act upon your claim until this office has rendered an opinion suggesting its duty in the premises. You wish to know whether or not the county board would be authorized in allowing your claim for actual expenses incurred in looking after criminal cases and county matters when you find it necessary to travel some di&gt;tance from the county seat. I think it is the uniform practice of the various county rds of the state to allow claims of this character without quest km, when it appears that the same were •ssaiily incurred and the charges therefor are found e reasonable and proper under the circumstances. By If to some distant part of the county to investigate determine upon the course to be pursued in criminal ten, the county attorney may often save the county the HUM of subpoenaing numerous witnesses to the county . When Mich is his purpose and the effect of his trip, county board should not hesitate about the allowance lis legitimate expenses. One of my predecessors held that the allowance of such claims was within the discretion of the county board, and that such board would have the right to audit claims of this character the -fame as other claims presented against the county. In the year 1900, our supreme court passed upon this question, and said: "The matter of allowing a sum to ihe county attorney to cover actual Decenary expenses incurred while investigating and prosecut - ing criminal cases and defending cases brought against the county U within the sound discretion of said board, and said board may, in the exercise of such discretion, lawfully allow and reimburse the county attorney for such expenditures."

The act referred to by you provides that a cooperative company, corporation, or association is defined to mean a cooperative company, corporation, or association which authorizes the distribution of its earnings in part, or wholly, on the basis of, or in proportion to, the amount of property bought from or sold to member*, or of labor performed, or </seg>

This act further confers upon such cooperative associa - tions the usual corporate powers exercised by general cor - porations. Under this law, these cooperative associations are also required to pay the same amount of incorporation fees as are required by law for like capitalization of general corporations in this state. I he so-called Blue Sky law, which is chapter 199, Session rs of 1913, defines "domestic" corporations, and says r shall include every corporation organized under and suant to the laws of the state of Nebraska.

Considering the law under which cooperative associa - tions are organised and the general character of the business upon which they may enter, is there any possible theory on which they are exempt from the requirements of the m&gt; railed Blue Sky law I The latter l;"v does not specifically exempt such cooperative association, although it specif - ically exempts building and loan companies organized in Nebraska, corporations organized at the time the law took t, corporations organized thereafter which have been in existence one year or more at the time of the sale of their Ptock, and corporations of other states which have been in existence live years or more at the time of the sale of their stock, the majority of the stockholders, directors, and offi - oers of which were at the time of commencing business, and were at the date of the approval of the act, citizens of the state of Nebraska. Ilad the legislature intended to exempt cooperative ; ions from the application of the Blue Sky law, it lias rely failed to do so specifically or by inference. By the aseology of the act it has expressly included such cooper - e associations.

You e&lt;l that the robbery of the bank at Primrose was com - ted by a principal, who was aided and abetted in com - ting this crime by a person residing in another county. I question is : Where is the proper place to try this accessory before the fact? In reply I will say that this question is one of consider- </seg>
            <seg id="p249">OPINIONS 159 should be indicted and tried in the county in which the accessorial acts were committed. This was expressly pro - vided in a statute enacted in 1549, which is regarded in the United States as a part of the common law. Where there is no statute changing this principle of the common law, the weight of authority would be that the accessory should be tried in the county where his acts in aiding and abetting the crime are done. K)ur own court has held that the crime of aiding, abetting, procuring another to commit a felony, as defined in sec - n 1, Criminal Code, is a substantive and independent me. (Oerter r. State, 57 Xeb., 135.) in view of this holding, and the absence of direct statu - y provision changing the common law, it would seem ibable the courts would hold that the accessory should tried in the county where the accessorial acts were com - ted. The Tennessee and Texas courts have held to the itrary, but Tennessee has a statute which is as follow EVhen an offense is committed partly in one county and partly in her, or the acts or effects thereof constituting or requisite to the ummation of the offense occur in two or more counties, the juris - on is in either county." (Stale r. Ayrrx, 67 Tenn., 97.) K'nder that statute, the accessory could be tried in the nty where the principal crime was committed. IFlie Texas court holds that the county where the principal me was committed had jurisdiction to try the accomplice accessory. (Carlisle r. State, 31 Tex. Crim. Rep., 537.) t, the Texas court also says that if the accomplice be ilty of a distinct offense from the felony committed, then &gt; accomplice should be tried in the county where his acts an accessory were committed. The court, however, holds it the crime of the accomplice and the principal was the ne, and, therefore, was committed in the county where ; crime was consummated.

(Compiled Statutes of 1911 ch. 9, sees. 23, 26.) The last legislature passed an act known as House Roll 340, which repealed section 10, chapter 9, Compiled Statutes of 1911, relative to the registration of county bonds. This act does not specifically repeal those provisions applying to precinct bridge and refunding bonds, and it is doubtful if it can be regarded as a repeal thereof by implication. It specifically provides that all county, city, village, school district, irrigation district, drainage district, and precinct bonds shall be first registered in the office of the auditor of public accounts and by him certified to the county clerk. It is then made the duty of the county clerk to register said bonds in the manner prescribed in this act. All such bonds are required to be signed by the proper officers issuing the* same, but I find no provision that requires the officers of school districts or municipalities to make a certificate in relation thereto. E follows that the secretary of state is not required to the auditor in certifying bonds, except possibly precinct ?e and precinct refunding bonds.

Ir an insurance company has revoked the license of its agent and notified the insurance department of the state of Nebraska of such revocation, any acts thereafter on the part of such agent claiming to represent the company would be unauthorized, and the agent would be liable to prosecution for receiving money under false pretenses, in case he collected and retained premiums under such revoked license. Hon. L. (}. Brian, Insurance Commissioner, Lincoln, Neb. I (ear Sir: I have yours of the 12th instant, in which you e that complaint is often made to your department of acts of agents of insurance companies who have !&gt;een &lt;li&gt; rged by the companies but continue to write insurance, collect and retain premiums, under the license issued by insurance department You wish to know whether the l of these agents bind the companies which they were ;it t authorized to represent, but which authority the coin ies revoked by notifying the agents and the insurance artment. faction 57, Insurance Code, among other things, provides no license shall be issued to any agent except upon the lication of the company upon a form to be furnished and filed with, the insurance board. I understand it to be the custom of the insurance depart ■eat to issue a license to an agent only when the insurance company has made application therefor, and, when the license is issued, to transmit the same to the insurance com - pany. The insurance company then transmits the license to the Rgent, and under it the agent undertakes to solicit business for the company. </seg>
            <seg id="p253">163 OPINIONS IJndoubtedly, an insurance company would have a right revoke the agent's authority to act under this license at r time it saw fit so to do. After it had revoked the same, notifying the agent of such revocation, such agent would ;e no authority to act for the company and bind it in the nsaction of business affairs. There is no way by which insurance company could procure the return to it of a &gt;nse which it had transmitted to the agent, if the agent uses to deliver the same. After the insurance company i revoked the license of its agent and notified your mrtment thereof, any acts thereafter on the part of the »nt claiming to represent the company would be unauth - zed and the agent would be laying himself liable to prose - ion for receiving money under false pretenses, in case collected iiul retained ;;iemi'.ims under such revo &lt;e.l n.-e.

Under the provisions of the railway commission act, a common carrier is not required to apply to the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion for permission to change its train schedules or time tables. </seg>
            <seg id="p254">164 Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen: Yours of the 12th instant is as follows: E ailing your attention to paragraph c, of section 15, of the com - on act, which reads as follows: " It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any railway company or common carrier to change any rate, schedule, or classification until application has been made to the railway commission and permission had for that purpose. Any railway company or common carrier vio - lating this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars." "I am directed by the commission to ask your opinion in writing aa to whether or not the word 'schedule' in said paragraph can properly be construed and maintained to mean train schedules, or time tables, of carriers operating trains between stations in this state, or whether it refers only to rate schedules." I?he section referred to is the last section of the railway amission act, and, by its terms, when a railroad company lertakes to change any rate, schedule, or classification, ore proper application has been made to your body for mission so to do, said railroad company subjects itself to ne not exceeding $1,000. It is an elementary proposition of law that in prosecutions the crime denounced must come within the plain provisions of the statute. I have examined the entire railway com - mission act and observe that the word "schedule" is used with reference to rates and charges which are fixed by the companies themselves, or, upon proper hearing, are fixed by the railway commission. Iection 6125, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, uires all common carriers to file with the commission, or before a certain date, their freight and passenger jdules, classifications, rates, tariffs,. and charges. Refer - b is also made in section 6126 to a schedule of rates to be d by the commission, and section 6128 pertains to the ision of the commission after a hearing on a schedule of is, etc. Section 6132 deals with emergency rates, tariffs, idules, orders, circulars, etc. Section 6135 relates to the </seg>
            <seg id="p255">165 publication of rates, fares, and charge?, and provides remedies in case of failure to publish the same. So from all these provisions, it is quite plain that when the word "schedule" is used it is in connection with the subject of the amount to be paid for the transportation of freight or passengers. Nowhere do I find any provision in the act which refers to train schedules or time tables. Iherefore, I hold that a prosecution could not be sue* y maintained against a company which failed to submit subject of its train schedules or time tables to your body orders thereon. The question as to when trains should un might arise indirectly when the commission is dealing li the withdrawing of certain train service, but I do not lk that, under the provisions of the railway commission a common carrier could be prosecuted for failure to ■ce application to the commission for the privilege of nging its train schedules or time tables.

Clarence E. Harmon, Deputy Food, Drug, Dairy, and Oil Commissioner, Lincoln, Xeb. Dear Sir: I am in receipt of yours of the 20th instaut, which is as follows: Efind that there is some difference of opinion in regard to the known as the 'Commission Merchants Law,' and I desire very l that you give me an opinion covering the matter. This law is d on page 723 of Revised Statutes of 1913, chapter 24, article 3, ons 2570, 2571, 2572, 2573, and 2574. K There are numerous concerns in South Omaha engaged in selling stock on commission. Do such concerns come under this law? "In Omaha, Lincoln, and other points, there are numerous concerns engaged in selling grain on commission. Do such concerns come under this law? §io such concerns as wholesale grocers, selling any kind of mer - rtise on commission, come under this law, regardless of the fact t':e merchandise may be shipped to them from another state? Eection 2574 says that whether the commission merchant is a ent of this state or not, if he advertises or solicits business, it be necessary to comply with this law. Can I proceed against such srns and force them to comply with this provision?" rction 2570, Revised Statutes of 1913, defines "commis - merchant" and is as follows: ■Any person, firm, or corporation pursuing or who shall pursue the Iness of selling farm, dairy, orchard, or garden produce, wares, or </seg>
            <seg id="p259">169 merchandise of any kind upon consignment for a commission, shall be deemed to be a commission merchant." The first question to determine is whether or not a com - mission merchant dealing in live stock on commission is included within the terms of this statute. If so, it finnan within the term "farm produce of any kind." The first meaning given the word "produce" in the Standard Dic- "That which is produced, brought forth, or yielded; a product; any - thing raised, grown, mined-, taken, or manufactured, tv human labor and skill." •From this it will be seen that the word "produce" is used interchangeably with "product." The "produce of the state" has been held to include timber, coal, and iron, as well as the ordinary crops grown upon land. (The term 'produce of the state,' as used in Const, art. 2, sec. 30, npting from taxation all articles manufactured 'of the produce of state,' embraces whatever is produced or grown in, or is the yield the state, including crops, timber, coal, and iron, and everything iuced from or found in the soil of the state. " (Benedict r. David- County, 67 S. W., 806.) re word "products" of the farm has been held to include stock. t' Pub. Laws 1899, c. 11, sec. 51, imposes on individuals, firms, or ir agents buying and selling fresh meats from stores, etc., in cities towns of less than 8,000 inhabitants, an annual license tax of $3, exempts farmers vending their own products, and without a regular ce of business. Section 71 prescribes the penalty. Held, that the rd 'products,' as used in the proviso exempting farmers, included &gt; stock and fresh meats. "Under the statute, cattle bought by farmers to be grazed and fattened on their farms and sold, though not actually 'produced' on the farm, may be sold by such farmers without a license." (Stalt c Bpaugh. 40 S. E., 60.) E Swine, horses, neat cattle, sheep, cord wood, hay, as well as vege - ;s, fruit, eggs, milk, butter, lard, and other provisions for the mouth, strictly 'products of the farm,' much more so, indeed, than beef, :h, though it comes, like everything else, primitively from the is as much a manufactured article as leather, cloth, or charcoal. </seg>
            <seg id="p260">170 The ox is a product of the farm; beef is a product of the slaughter house and the shambles. CUf of I'hilndclithin r. harla (Pa.), 6 Watt * 8., 269, 279." (Words &amp; Phrases, Vol. 3, P. 2699.) | r rom this it will be seen there is authority holding it "farm produce" includes live stock of all kinds pro - ved from the farm. In passing this law, the legislature \ in mind the interests of the seller of the products of the ins of this state. This follows from the fact that the omission merchant is required to give ■ bond for the ttection of those from whom he takes the products to sell commission. It would seem that the legislature intended make the definition cover commission merchants who il in all kinds of farm products. If this were not the ention, it would include a small class of such commission rchants. IMiile there is more or less doubt about this question, I ok the law should be so construed as to include the sell - of live stock on commission, the selling of grain on colli - sion, and the selling, by any person or corporation, of iducts of the faim, dairy, orchard, or garden, where the ne are placed in the hands of a commission merchant to sold on commission. Any person, company, or eorpvra - n, who has a place of business in this state, and under - es to sell in this state the products designated above, •uld comply with the law by taking out a license and ing a bond. It is possible that if the commission mer - mt only dealt in products shipped from another state, might escape a compliance with this law on the ground t he was engaged in interstate commerce, but it is probable that a case of this kind will be found.

B)ear Sir: 1 have yours of the 23rd instant, which i., a ows: V[ am requested by the board of supervisors to ask your department an opinion on the following question: t'A legal road petition, signed by ten electors residing within five 3 of the proposed road, was duly filed with the county clerk, as ided by section 2857, Revised Statutes of 1913, and all things un !er said petition, as by statute required. Before the final n of the board was taken, a remonstrance was filed against the ig of the road, which said remonstrance contained eight of the names which were attached to the petition. Now the question is: Can the electors who signed their names to the road petition equently withdraw them by signing the remonstrance, and thereby e null and void the petition?' " In the year 1901, this department held: ■'Before a licensing board has acted upon a petition for a license sell intozcating liquors, the signer of the petition may withdraw name." In that opinion reference was made to the case of Liri&gt;&lt; : j stun V. Corey, 33 Xeb., .'!(&gt;&lt;&gt;, wherein the court held it was not error, after a petition for a license was filed with the city clerk and notice thereof was given, for the city council t&lt;&gt; permit other freeholders to sij&gt;n the petition. In that ease three of the petitioners were permitted to withdraw their mimes after the petition had been filed. In the case of Ashley v. Burt County, 7.5 Neb., 159, the supreme court of this state held that a land owner, who had united in a petition for the establishment of a public road and who had expressly waived compensation for dan - arising therefrom, might withdraw such waiver by filing a claim for compensation befoie the establishment of a I do not like the practice that permits petitioners for establishment of a road to either withdraw their naami )articipate in a remonstrance, but nevertheless thi&gt; is </seg>
            <seg id="p262">172 (observe that section 2858, Eevised Statutes of 1913, es the petitioners for the establishment of a public road )sit with the county clerk a sufficient sum of money ay for the laying out or alteration of such road, and unless the road is finally established or altered the ■uses thereof shall be paid out of such deposit. If the I is finally established, the money shall be returned to persons who deposited the same. In the case referred to by you, ten qualified petitioners signed the petition. Eight of these joined in a remon - strance. So far as these eight are concerned, the joining in the remonstrance would be equivalent to withdrawing their names from the petition. With that condition confronting the board, I do not think it should proceed and establish the road. In that event, of course, the petitioners would be held for the payment of the expenses incurred up to this point in the proceedings. The board should then await the filing of a new petition signed by persons who are sincere in having the road established. There is good reason for holding that, when the board has once acquired jurisdic - tion by the filing of a proper petition, it may retain it irre - spective of the wishes of certain petitioners to withdraw their names. Nevertheless, in view of the liability of the petitioner! for the expenses incurred, I think the board should treat the remonstrance, backed by a majority of the original petitioners, as a withdrawal of the petition. Very respectfully, GRANT (J. MARTIN, February 28, 1914. Attorney General. Progressive Party — Ballot — Primary Election. The progressive party is entitled to a primary ballot at the next pri - mary election, provided it polled at the last general election one per cent of the entire vote in the state, county, or district In which it seeks to make nominations for office. </seg>

In substance, your ques- Is the progressive party entitled to have a primary ballot at the next primary election by members of said party simply filing for cer - tain offices, or will it be necessary for that party to meet in mass con - vention and form a new party, so far as your county, or subdivisions thereof, is concerned? IiTou refer to sections 2168, 2169, and 2170, Revised Stat - es of 1913. These sections provide for the organization of w political parties. 500 electors are required to meet in tate convention; 100 in a congressional, district, or county lvention; and 25 in a city, village, precinct, or ward con - ation, except in cities or counties having a population 50,000 or more, when 200 electors are required to partici - te. These conventions are required to adopt a party me and file certificates of nomination with the proper icers. The progressive party was organized in the year 1912, under these provisions. The supreme court had the validity of this organization under consideration, and held that the progressive party was properly organized and as such was entitled to a place upon the official ballot at the general election held in the year 1912. (Morrissey v. Wait, 92 Neb., 271.) The principal question determined in that case was as to whether a new party might be formed after a </seg>
            <seg id="p264">174 general election ballot. The court held such could be done. So that the progressive i)arty has become organized in this state and has participated in one general election. In my judgment, it is now entitled to a place on the primary ballot at the next primary election, the same as any othe.* political party, piovided it polled at the last general election one per cent of the entire vote in the state, county, sub - division, or district in which it seeks to make nominations tor office. (Revised Statutes of 1913, sec. 2164.) That U tn say, if in your county the progressive party polled at least one per cent of the entire vote in that county, and it appears it did nccording to your statement as to vote on the (lectors, it would be entitled to a primary ballot for the nomination of county officials. If in your subdivision or 'listrict. where nominations are to be made, the progress - he party polled at the last general election ;&lt;t lea^t OD.C I er cent of the entire vote of such subdivision or district, it would be entitled to ■ primary ballot in such subdivision or district. Referring again to section :21(&gt;8, Revised Statutes of L913, which requires that 100 electors assemble in a mass con - vention in a congressional, district, or county convention, or -o in a city, village, precinct or ward convention, I am &lt;&gt;t' (he opinion that this has reference to the original forma - tion of a now party. That is to say, it' a new party had not been formed in the Mate, and it was desired to form one in a county, it would require 100 electors to assemble in a - county convention for that purpose. But, as stated before, the necessity of this is obviated witli reference to the progressive patty because it has already become organ - ized as a state party and I judge has received at least one pw cent of the vote in every county in the state, ami per - il] every subdivision thereof.

I have heretofore held as follows: "The sheriff is limited to the salary provided by law. For such ■alary he must perform all duties relating to his office. I do not think the law contemplates reimbursing the sheriff for expenses incurred for serving papers, or for making arrests in his county. Evi - dently the legislature intended that the sheriff furnish his own means of conveyance for the salary fixed by the statute.

I tear Sir: I have your favor of the 29th ultimo, in which i say that an inheritance tax is due in your county from estate; that it was not paid within a year after the ■case of the person whose heirs are subject to the tax; t the administrator of the estate was ready and willing all times to pay the tax as soon as the amount thereof s ascertained; that he, in fact, requested that he be »wed to pay the tax prior to the expiration of the year; 1 that the delay in the payment of the tax was no fault the administrator of the estate. You inquire whether, ier this state of facts, the heirs should be penalized with west The proper answer to your question is not altogether free from doubt. In re San ford's Estate, 133 N.

This would Mem to imply that if they were in no way to blame for delay in making payment, there might be some doubt as to whether or not they would be required to pay interest. Khe authorities, however, are not uniform upon this ques - . In the case of People v. Rice, 40 Colo., 508, it was held : "Where the heir of a testator contested the will and the executors paid him an additional amount in consideration of his withdrawing the contest, that the entire amount received by him from the estate, less the exemption, is subject to the tax; and that, although the con - test was not terminated until more than six months after the testa - tor's death, and many suits were pending, so that the amount of the tax during such time could not be determined, still the statute imposes interest on such tax at six per cent from the testator's death until paid, since it cannot be construed as a penalty and subject to rebate under such conditions." In the case of Sktlto* r. Campbell, 10!) TVnn., 690, it was "The collateral inheritance and succession tax becomes due and payable at the end of one year from the death of the decedent, from which time interest shall be charged at the rate of six per cent per annum on such tax; and the fact that proceedings to test the validity of the will are pending cannot postpone the maturity of the tax, where it appears that the tax will be payable, and at the same rate, whether the will is sustained or overthrown." Ii the case last quoted, it was impossible to determine, i accuracy, the exact value of the property subject to tax within the time limit fixed for the payment of same, mse of the fact that the inheritance tax was assessable ■ on the "clear value" of the estate, that is to say the value after the payment of all debts and expenses of linistration, including the expenses and attorneys fees lied in resisting a contest of the will, and said time t was pas&gt;ed before said expenses could be determined, the court held : "In such case, it is the duty of the executor and clerk of the county court to make an estimate of such fees and expenses, and to allow </seg>

The general rule permits the introduction in evidence of dying declarations in homicide cases only. This rule has been modified by some of the courts in cases where death is an essential ingredient of the crime charged, and, when such is the case, dying declarations are admissible. Our own court lias held: "In a prosecution for homicide in procuring an abortion under sec - tion 6, of the Criminal Code, dying declarations of the deceased may be admitted in evidence, under the same conditions and limitations as in prosecutions for murder or manslaughter." (Edtcards r. State, 79 Neb., 251, 112 N. W., 611.) This, in my judgment, is in accord with the latest deci - sions of other states. But, you call my attention to section . Civil Code, and ask whether or not a dying declara - tion, under the circumstances stated by you, may be admitted in evidence in view of our statute, which is as follows: E Neither husband nor wife can be examined in any case as to any munication made by the one to the other while married, nor shall , after the marriage relation ceases, be permitted to reveal, in mony, any communication made while the marriage subsisted." This statute was intended to prevent the husband or wife from disclosing confidential communications made by one to the other while the marriage relation existed, and should not be construed to prevent one of the parties from disclosing a dying declaration made by the other. Section G06, Civil Code of Kentucky, is as follows: K Neither a husband nor his wife shall testify, while the marriage ta or afterwards, concerning any communication between them Ing marriage." </seg>

Section 6316, Revised Statutes of VJV.i, provides: "Live stock in charge of an agistor, caretaker, or non-resident owners, on the first day of April of the year for which the property is required to be listed, and not connected with the farm, shall be assessed where so kept; and any live stock which shall be brought into any county of this state for grazing purposes between the first day of April and first day of July of any year shall be assessed by the •raessor or by the county board in such county and in the proper tax - ing district unless the owner of said live stock produce a certificate from the county clerk, or other proper officer, showing that such property has been assessed elsewhere." The meaning of the words "'and not connected with the farm" is most important in determining the legislative idea in the enactment of this section. This clause might mean "not connected with the home farm of (he owner of the cattle" or it might mean "not connected with the farm of the agistor or caretaker where they are kept." This latter meaning seems the Wetter construction of this clause. The legislature evidently intended to assess live stock where they were fouru. on April 1st. The two pre - ceding sections bear on* this construction of the statute. In section 6315 it is clearly stated that when the owner of live stock does not reside upon the farm where the stock is kept this stock shall be assessed where the farm is situated. In my opinion, therefore, these cattle were properly wed in Cherry county. You state that the lax on these cattle has already been paid in Brown county.

Hdh. L. a. Britm, Insurmnee Commissioner, Lincoln, Dear Sir: You have called my attention to a communi - cation received by you from the Royal Highlanders, and asked tliat I give you the benefit of my views regarding the same. I learn from your statement that the examiners of the urance department have made an examination of this ociation, and have rendered to it an itemized hill for il services, under the provisions of section 21, new insur - ■e code. In substance, this association claims that your laitinent has no authority for mating an examination its condition and charging to it the expenses therefor, 1 that there can be no liability against a fraternal organ - lioa for this service under any provision of the insiu- Section ".!, insurance code, defines company, corporation, insurance company, or insurance corporation, and says that when these terms are used they shall include associations or individuals engaged in the business of insuring. From these definitive terms, it is clear that fraternal associations are included in the designation "insurance companies." Section 21 provides that every insurance company of every kind or class shall pay the fees and expenses for an examination. It follows that the fees provided for in tion 21 should be paid by any association which is author - ized to issue an insurance policy or benefit certificate. It is suggested by the chief secretary of the Royal High - landers that section 103, of the code, expressly exempts fraternal associations from the payment of the fees and expenses designated in said section 21. Said section 163 txemuts fraternal associations from the provisions of tlie </seg>
            <seg id="p284">194 statutes relating to life insurance companies. That exemption, I take it, applies to the regulatory measures peculiarly applicable to life insurance companies as dis - tinguished from other kinds of insurance companies, but does not go to the extent of exempting fraternal associa - tions from paying the fees and expenses of an examination made of their condition when found necessary by the insur - a nee department. The chief secretary also calls attention to section 167. and says that non-resident associations are required to paV one-half only of what the department wishes to charge resi - dent associations. An inspection of section 1(&gt;7 will show that the examination therein referred to is the original examination made of a non-resident company after it has filed its charter and articles of association with the insurance board, and this examination is preliminary to the admission of such non-resident company into this state. The department may examine into the character and busi - - methods of said foreign associations at its home office, and for this service the officer making the investigation is limited to $5 per day and expenses of travel. Said section lt!7 has nothing whatever to do with an examination of a company after it has been admitted into this state or one which has been organized in this state and lias been rab - jeeted to an examination similar to the one under consider - ation. The law imposes upon the insurance board the duty of making an examination of fraternal associations to determine whether or not they are entitled to a certiri cate. and when so entitled the certificate issues from the board. Section 183 provides that all expenses or costs incident to the proceedings under the provisions of the law relating to fraternal insurance shall be paid by the association interested. Those expenses and costs, I judge, shall be determined in amount by the provisions of said section 21. I. therefore, conclude that the Royal Highlanders, being a </seg>

Assuming the truth of your statement, that a one bottle scale is the only scale with which each sample of cream can be weighed accurately, a regulation providing that only one bottle scales shall be used is a reasonable one. I do not think the bare fact that an inspector of cream failed to comply with the rules and regulations requiring that all testing be done with a one bottle scale would in itself con - stitute a violation of section 24, article 1, chapter 24, Revised Statutes of 1913. It would, however, constitute, in my opinion, a violation of the provisions of section 20 and also of section 25, of said article and chapter. If, by reason of a failure to use the prescribed kind of scale, any false result would be obtained in making any test of cream or milk, that would constitute a violation of the provisions of said section 24, of said chapter and article. In closing this letter allow me to suggest that great care should be taken in determining the reasonableness of mak - ing any change in methods of testing where such change will result in loss and inconvenience to those engaged in the testing and handling of cream, but when it is apparent that, in order to obtain a fair and correct test, a change in the method of weighing samples must be made, I have no doubt of the legal right of your department to make enforceable rules and regulations providing for such change. In support of the legal proposition that your de - partment has a right to adopt reasonable rules and regu - lations, not in conflict with statutory provisions, for the testing of cream I call attention to section 10(5 of Thornton on Pi!i"i Poo&lt;l and Drues. also to the cases of Butterfield </seg>

Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Rentlemen: You have asked for an opinion from this ce on the following question: "If a telephone company gives to its farm line subscribers added service on an additional flat rate basis, denying said service on such </seg>

Thf circumstances leading to this inquiry are as follows "The Benedict exchange of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and the Stromsburg exchange of the Polk County Telephone Company are at the present time giving reciprocal service between the two exchanges to their farm line subscribers only, at a rate of fifty cents per month, in addition to their regular farm line rate. That is. farm line subscribers are given the service of the two exchanges at an added rate of fifty cents per month. City subscribers of the two exchanges are not accorded this service and rate but are required to pay the regular toll rate for service between the two exchanges." Kn.just discrimination is defined in the railway eonunis - nct as follows: "If any railway company or common carrier subject to the provi - sions of this article, directly or indirectly, through or by its agents, officers, or employees, by any special rate, rebate, drawback, or other device, shall charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person, firm, or corporation a greater or less compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by it than it charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other person, firm, or corporation for doing a like and contemporaneous service, the same shall constitute an unjust discrimination, which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlaw - ful." It is undoubtedly true that there must be classes among telephone users, and that there must he a different charge put upon the individuals in these vaiious classes.

From the facts set out in your letter, it appears thai ■ certain minimum charge of fifty cents per month is made to the farm Hue patrons, whereby they have full ace-- to all of the subscribers on both lines without paying extra toll. The town subscribers of thes&lt;&gt; lines do not have this minimum rate, but must, in each instance, pay the toll reqmred. On its face this looks like a discrimination in favor of the farm line patron. It looks as though tile toll service between two towns is discriminatory unles- the charge is the same to each patron of the calling exeha When a subscriber of the Btromsborg exchange calls one of the subscribers of the Benedict exchange the same ser - vice must be rendered by these two exchanges whether the penoo calling il on a farm line or on a town line. Unless conditions are dissimilar as affecting the expense ur difficulty of performing the service demanded of ■ t;-le phone company, or unless other conditions arise, which seem to require or warrant a different rate, each patron should be charged the same price. (Western Union Tele - ffraph Co. r. CM PtMi*hm§ ('&lt;&gt;.. 44 Xel... 326; Nebi Telephone Co. v. State, 55 Xeb., (127.) I do not think a different toll rate should be made as between the business and residence phone users of either of these exchanges. It would clearly be discrimination.

To give him access to these neighbors on the er exchange at a cheap rate seems equitable. It is dly possible that any of the farmers on these lines, out - ? of those on the lines which overlap, would care to take •antage of this minimum rate. By reason of this com x and intermingled condition of the farm lines of t'e i exchanges, I believe conditions exist which would war - t the commission in permitting this minimum rate of i rcourse between the two exchanges to remain in effc &lt;t. Another condition, which affects the farm lines and which should give then cheaper service, is the difficulty in getting the line. Where the farmer is on the same line with ten or twelve other fanners and he wishes to call a neighbor, who is on another farm line, which lias ten or twelve subscribers, he may have the utmost difficulty in getting the person he wishes. This question is a close one, but I believe there is enough difference in the conditions attending the use of this toll service by these farm line subscribers to warrant the coin mission in authorizing this rate.

In answer to the question propounded I will say that it' the provision! of said section l!li74 were considered alone I would be inclined to think that they were not applicable in the case of blackbirds. You will note, however, that section 2670, Revised Statutes of 1913, makes it unlawful to wound or kill certain enumerated kinds of birds, and adds to the kinds there enumerated the words "or other bird." It neons, therefore, that literally and strictly speaking the statute in terms forbids the killing of blackbirds. I think it is doubtful, however, if the legislature had blackbirds in mind when the statute in question was passed. Hence it will take either a decision of our supreme court, or an amend UM nt to the statute, to determine definitely whether or not it is unlawful to kill blackbirds in this state.

Section 1972 requires the clerk of the district court to select said judges and clerks of election from a list of names to be furnished him by the chairman of the county central committees of the various political parties within the county. These lists shall contain the names of live per - sons for each voting precinct in the county, who are duly qualified to serve as judges and clerks of election. The clerk of the district court shall select from these lists so furnished him one judge and one clerk for each voting precinct from the political party polling the highest number of votes at the last general election in the precinct, as shown by the votes cast for the first set of candidates on the state ticket, and said clerk shall also select one judge and one clerk from the party polling the next highest number of votes, and one jndge from the party polling the third highest number of votes.

The first set of candidates on the state ticket at the last general election consists of the names of the candidates for the office of governor. The offices for presidential electors and congress are created by the federal constitution and the laws of Congress, and are not to be regarded as state offices.

This provision of the constitution prohibits, in my opin - ion, the board of commissioners of state institutions from diverting a part of the fund appropriated by the legislature for the payment of the wages of guards and employees at the state penitentiary to the payment of other expenses of that institution.

Hon. W. B. Howard, Auditor of Public Accounts, Lincoln, XeO. Dear Sir: You have referred to me a communication received by you from the commission appointed by the last latin e to investigate the water power laws of our state, in which your attention is called to the fact that, by resolution of the house, it was provided that the expenses of said commission should be paid out of the incidental fund of the state, on vouchers signed by the speaker of the house and approved by the governor. You inquire whether this resolution of the house, without the concurrent action of the senate and without the approval of the governor to said resolution, was a sufficient appropriation to authorize you to pay out of the appropri - ation made for another purpose the expenses incurred by said commission. In answer to the question propounded I will say that, in opinion, there has been no lawful appropriation of funds meet this expense, and that, strictly and technically aking, you are not justified in law in making the pay- Hi. This is said without any intention to reflect upon the emission for incurring such expenditures, for I am lined to believe that the purpose for which the commis - n was appointed, and in furtherance of which the tense was incurred, was a laudable one.

Railroad Track — Transmission Wires — Expense of Raising. rre a railroad company builds a new line of track which must pass under established telephone or electric transmission wires, running along a public highway, the expense of raising said wires, at the point of crossing, to the statutory height above the railroad track should be borne by the company owning the telephone or transmission wires. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Iientlemen: In answer to your letter of recent date, in ich you ask the opinion of this department as to whether not a railroad company, in building a new line of track ich must pass under established telephone or electric nsmission wires, running along a public highway, is ble for the expense of raising said wires, at the point crossing, to the statutory height above the railroad ck, I will say that, in my opinion, it is the company ning the telephone or transmission wires, and not the lroad company, that should pay the expense of raising ■ wires to the desired height where same cross the rail - id track.

(Missouri Pacific RmUwmjf v. Cats County, 76 Xeb., 396.) It occurs to me that, by a parity of reason, the court will d, if such a case ever comes before it for decision, under statutory provisions now in force in this state regarding crossing of railroad tracks by telephone and electric nsmission wires, that it is the duty of the company own - and operating such wires to stand the expense of placing 1 maintaining them at the required height, even though railroad track which they cross may have been built er the construction of such lines of wire.

In the probating of wills, a county judge should not charge a filing fee for orders and decrees for which a charge has already been made; for the making and recording of a necessary order or decree, not exceeding one hundred words, he should charge a fee of fifty cents; for each day's attendance, on which he hears argument or takes evidence in a case, he should charge $1; </seg>
            <seg id="p318">228 for each certificate of probate he should charge twenty-five cent! over and above the $2 for probating the will; for the order admitting the will to probate he should make a separate charge; and for issuing a notice or citation under his seal he should charge fifty cents, whether the notice be sent by mail or sent to a newspaper for publication. ro M. Nicholson, Esq., County Attorney of (' timing County, West Point, Neb. K)ear Sir: i'his office is in receipt of your letter of vember 25, in which you ask various questions relative the fees which should be charged by county judges in probating of wills. I our first question calls for an opinion as to whether the nty judge is entitled to charge a filing fee for orders and rees made in a probate cause, also whether he is entitled •barge a fee for filing the letters testamentary issued in h cause. The statute provide* for a fee of ten cents for ig any paper in any probate matter for which no fee has n specifically fixed. (Revised Statutes of 1913, sec. 9.) In my opinion, the county judge should not charge i fee for filing any order or decree for which a charge has &gt;ady been made. Von further ask whether the county judge should charge a fee for making any necessary order in the probating of ■ will, and whether he is entitled to I charge for a day's attendance for each day on which these orders are made, it being understood that if he makes more than one of these orders in an estate on the same day he charges for only one day's attendance for that day. The statute seems to be plain that for the making and recording of an order or decree, not exceeding one hundred words, there shall be ■ eharga of fifty cents. (Revised Statutes of 1913, sec. _'44!». ) The statutory charge of $1 for attendance should be made for each day on which the judge hears argument or takes evidence in a case. Simplv signing an order would ii * * * i not call for a fee for attendance. </seg>
            <seg id="p319">229 1 0 11 &lt;l I SO doK \\ ili^lll'i III*. 1 1: tr Ol *F*» 1UF 1 1 1 tr I ) TO l)u \\. OX *l will and the entry thereof includes the certificate of probate, and whether this charge of $2 covers the fee for the order which he makes admitting the will to probate. It occurs to me that the fee of $2 does not include the making of the order admitting the will to probate, and does not include the certificate of probate which the county judge is required by law to attach to a will. I do not understand that this certificate of probate is a part of the probate of the will. (Dame on Probate &amp; Administration, sec. 95.) That being true, the county judge should make a charge of twenty-five cents for this certificate. You say that the county judge in your county has made it his practice not to issue subpoenae for the appearance of the witnesses to a will, but, instead, issues orders under his hand and seal ordering the witnesses to appear at a specified time, and that it is liis custom to mail these orders to the wilMmji. You ask whether the county judge i&gt; entitled to the statutory fee of fifty cents, which is author - ized for issuing a notice or citation under seal. You also ask whether the county judge is entitled to charge tli i ~ for notices sent to a newspaper for publication, such notices being under his hand and seal. The statute calls for the fee of fifty cents for "issuing citation or notice under seal." It seems to me where the notice is made under his hand and seal, the office is entitled to this fee whether this notice is sent by mail, or otherwise, to the witni whether it is sent to a newspaper for publication.
