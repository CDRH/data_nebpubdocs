            <seg id="p004">Nebraska has not yet lost any Federal funds through Inability to match them, but attention is again directed to the (act that the State has not and will not be able, at the present rate of financing, to meet all of the Federal aid available as rapidly as it becomes due. A3 required by Federal regulations, contracts have been let and construction has progressed on roadside improvement projects during the past biennlum. This activity began approximately six years ago. Although climatic conditions have not been favorable, satisfactory results from the roadside Improvement program are beginning to show, and it is evident that if climatic conditions again become more favorable that this type of work will require less main - tenance and that the results will be far more evident. Legislation is needed to control encroachment on highway right of way and to control ingress to and egress from the highways. This type of legisla - tion is needed in order to protect the roadside improvement as well as the natural beauty now existing, and to provide for safety measures with respect to entering or leaving the highway by either public or private entrances and exits. The State-wide Highway Planning Survey is progressing as rapidly as can be expected. This is a very detailed survey and inventory of the 100,500 miles of Nebraska roads, and has for its purpose a determination of present con - ditions, present and prospective traffic, cost of improvements already made, cost of future Improvements, sources of revenue, a study of road use classified as to different types of vehicles, and other available information, which when compiled and analyzed, will be of great aid in determining future highway policies. This type of survey is now being conducted in 46 of the 48 states. Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage The annual water supply in the Platte River basin for the 1937-1938 biennium was 19 per cent greater than for the 1935-1936 blennium. The supply for the months of July and August of the 1937-1938 biennium was 44 per cent greater than for the 1935-1936 biennium. However, the supply in July and August of the 1937-1938 biennium was approximately 27 per cent below the ten-year mean — 1928-1937. In connection with the Nebraska-Wyoming suit, six sessions have been held during the present biennium before Hon. Michael J. Doherty. Special Master for the Federal Supreme Court, and at least two more hearings will be held before Nebraska rests. A suit was brought by the United States of America against A. C. Tilley, et al, relative to Warren Act Contracts, and mandamus proceedings have been instituted against Governor R. L. Cochran and State Engineer A. C. Tilley, to close junior canals in the order of priority . for the benefit of Kearney appropriators. The work connected with these suits has greatly increased the duties of the Bureau of Irrigation. A very considerable part of this work has been carried on by the Bureau of Irrigation in addition to the heavy routine work resulting from the organization, during the biennium, of a large number of rural electri - fication districts, and also from the irrigation and power projects that are under construction, all of which required the time and attention of the personnel in both the Bridgeport and Lincoln offices. Detailed information relative to the activities 6f the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage is given in Part II of this report. State. Planning Board In accordance with your recommendation to the 1937 session of the Legislature, the Nebraska State Planning Board was given legal status through the passage of L. B. 531. The legislation authorized the Board to conduct a survey of the building needs of the institutions owned by the State and operated by the Board of Control, the University of Nebraska, and the Board of Edu - cation for State Normal Schools. The Board was also authorized to conduct, with your approval, a survey of human tuberculosis as well as other social, economic or physical surveys of interest to the people of the State. Appropriations were made of $15,000 for general administrative expense. $15,000 for the Tuberculosis Survey, and $10,000 for the Institutional Survey. The personnel of the State Planning Board staff varies greatly in number due to the fact that the projects which the State Planning Board is sponsoring are, largely conducted with the assistance of the Works Progress Administration, and consequently, the number of persons employed fluctuates with the number and size of the projects. The Planning Board staff has included four employees on the State pay roll and from four to twelve supervisory employees paid by the Works Progress Administration. Clerical and skilled workers have also been furnished and paid by the Works Progress Administration. Generally speaking, the total number of employees has ranged from 60 to 180 and has averaged about 80. The excellent cooperation of the Works Progress Admin - istration In connection with the planning work has made it possible for the State to accomplish with relatively small appropriations a great volume of research, with the attending compilation of statistics in connection with the projects which have been authorized, which could not have been accomplished without that cooperation. IV </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Consultant service has been supplied to the Planning Board by the National Resources Committee and the Office of Education of the Department of Interior. Washington. D. C. Excellent cooperation has been had from other public agencies including the educational institutions, and consultant services on many - matters have been available through these public agencies where problems required specialized technical consideration. The members of the Planning Board have given freely of their time and talents without remuneration and are to be commended for the interest they have shown and the efforts they have expended in behalf of the Board. The same may be said of those In private life who have voluntarily served On various committees. The Nebraska Medical Association, the State Department of Health, and the Nebraska Tuberculosis Association have cooperated closely with the Planning Board in connection with the tuberculosis survey, and through their efforts this survey has been successfully conducted at a cost far below that which would have been necessary without the cooperation of these bodies. Motor Vehicle Division Safety Patrol. The chief officer of the Patrol is the State Sheriff who appointed Captain R. F. Weller to take charge of the Patrol's activities. The appropriations of this subdivision are made to the Department of Roads CJid Irrigation. The expenses of the Patrol are paid from the fund derived from operators' license fees after the costs of administering the Act have been paid from that fund. The period from June through the major part of November of 1937 was given over to organizational work and the selection and training of the personnel for the Division. All candidates were required to meet minimum qualifications. Eventual selection was made on a competitive merit basis. All members of the Division received specialized training at the Patrol Camp, held at the National Guard Camp at Ashland over a five weeks' period from October 9 to November 13. 1937. The Patrol began active duty on November 22, 1937. Under the terms of the statutes the Patrol is confined to the enforcement of motor vehicle laws. It was found in setting up the organization for the administration of the drivers license act that definite advantages as to cost could be obtained by having examinations conducted by the Safety Patrol, and this at the same time, made it possible to make an increase in the number of patrol officers. At the present time, therefore, operators license examinations are conducted by Patrol officers and they in turn patrol the highways in the necessary travel between county seats where the examinations are held. If a separate group of examiners had been set up, it would have necessitated much loss of time in traveling between county seats, whereas that time is now consumed in active service by the patrolmen. The act which created the Patrol and which provided for the licensing of operators also provided for compulsory motor vehicle inspection. The State does not make the Inspection but does approve the authorized inspection stations which may be municipal or private. Preference is given to municipal stations in those instances where they are established. It is necessary for the State to make periodical inspection of these stations, and here again it was found economical to place the administration of this activity under the Patrol in order to avoid a duplication of travel. The body of the report shows in detail the activities that have been con - ducted by the Patrol. As contemplated in the statute, an active educational program was undertaken by the Division. During the first ten months of 1938 a reduction of 31 per cent in fatalities has been effected. Motor Vehicle Registration. Another principal function of the Motor Vehicle Division is the registration of motor vehicles, which has been handled by this Department since 1919. Although the actual motor vehicle registrations are made in the various County Treasurers' offices, this office acts as a clearing house to compile the registration records for the entire State. A copy of each regis - tration is kept on file in order to supply information to the general public and to assist law enforcement officials both in this State and other States. This Division also supplies the license plates to each County Treasurer and supervises the registration in order that a uniform procedure will be followed in all counties. The Motor Vehicle Dealers' License Law was amended by the 1937 Legis - lature and became effective January 1, 1938. This Act provides for the licensing directly by this Division of all motor vehicle dealers and salesmen in Nebraska. During the last ten months a total of 4,963 licenses were issued and nine formal complaints were heard before the State Engineer as Administrator, and the Advisory Board. Following these complaints three licenses were revoked, one license suspended for thirty days, one application for license denied, and four complaints dismissed. In conclusion, I am glad to point out again — and particularly to call to your attention — the loyalty of the employees of this Department and their unselfish efforts, without regard to hours worked, in the carrying out of their duties.

            <seg id="p015">TWENTY-SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE Department of Roads and Irrigation OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA PART 1 Report of bureau of Roads and Bridges As In the former biennial reports the subject matter of this report is detailed under the several departmental reports as shown by the index. However, it is desired to discuss briefly some of the matters con - cerning which questions are most often asked relative to the Bureau of Roads and Bridges. This report of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges covers the period from November 1, 1936, to October 31, 1938, which is the latest date considered possible to use in order to have the information available for the Governor and Legislature by January 3, 1939. BRIEF HISTORY The Nebraska Legislature in 1895 created a department known as the "State Board of Irrigation" whose duties were confined ex - clusively to irrigation matters. In 1911 the name of the Board was changed to the "State Board of Irrigation, Highways, and Drainage," and provision was made in addition to irrigation and drainage matters for design and joint supervision of State-aid bridges. 15 </seg>
            <seg id="p016">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER . The first legislative authorization for a State Highway Depart - ment in Nebraska was in a 1913 law, which authorized counsel to coun - ties concerning highway improvements. The next step in the develop - ment of the State Highway System and the beginning of the present era of road construction was by the passage of the Federal-aid Road Act by Congress in 1916, and the acceptance of the terms of this Federal Act by Nebraska's 1917 Legislature. The 1919 Legislature adopted the Civil Administrative Code Bill, and this Department's name became the "Department of Public Works"; with a Bureau of Roads and Bridges, Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage, and the Division of Motor Vehicle Registration, all under the State Engineer. In 1933 the Legislature changed the name of this Department to "Department of Roads and Irrigation," which is its present name, with the State Engineer having been given additional duties as Director of Motor Vehicles, Chairman of the State Planning Board, and Director of Highway Safety and Patrol, which are in addition to the former principal duties involving the Bureau of Roads and Bridges, the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage, and Division x&gt;f Motor Vehicle Registration. In 1913 there were 25,617 motor vehicles registered in Nebraska. In 1938 there were approximately 450,000, an increase of 1,656.0 per cent in 25 years. In 1919 there were 5,000 miles established by the Legislature as a State Highway System. In 1921, a "seven-per-cent Federal-aid sys - tem" was established, generally superimposed over the 1919 State Highway System and totaling 5,619 miles, which with minor changes has a total of 5,630 miles in 1938 and remains substantially as originally approved in 1921. The Legislatures, beginning in 1927, have increased the total mile - age of the State Highway System by the establishment of four brackets of State highways, which in 1938 total approximately 11,142 miles, of which 8,649, including feeder roads, are marked and maintained as of October 1, 1938. The Nebraska State Highway System has always been operated on a "pay-as-you-go" basis. All work done has been paid for, and there never have been any outstanding obligations and there are none at the 'present time. Up to 1925 all State funds for State highway work and for matching Federal aid were raised by levy on property. The 1925 Legislature provided for the first gasoline tax. All of this tax, which amounted to two cents per gallon, was appropriated to the State for construction and maintenance of State highways. In April, 1929, the gasoline tax was increased from two cents to four cents per gallon, one cent going to the counties and three cents going to this Department. On April 1, 1935, the gasoline tax was increased from four cents to five cents per gallon, one and one-half cents going to the counties, </seg>
            <seg id="p017">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION two and one-half cents going to this Department, and one cent going to the State Assistance Fund. That portion of the Gasoline Tax Law dealing with this last one cent to the State Assistance was declared unconstitutional and the tax returned to four cents between August 31, 1935, and November 26, 1935, when the Special Session of the Legislature increased the tax to a five cents total again — the extra cent again going to the State Assistance Fund until February 28, 1937, when the tax became four cents. On March 24, 1937, the tax was increased by the Legislature from four cents to five cents; with one and one-half cents going to the coun - ties, three cents to this Department, and one-half cent to the State Assistance, with provisions relative to this Department using a por - tion to match Federal Feeder Road Funds. The Gasoline Tax Law in effect at the time of this Report, on October 1, 1938, will expire June 30, 1939. The tax is then to revert to four cents with one and one-half cents again going to counties and the remainder to this De - partment. Details of gasoline tax collections by months are given in Table 8. Details of obligations from 1918 to 1938 inclusive, are given in Table 6.

            <seg id="p020">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER NEBRA8KA STATE HIGHWAY MILEAGE The following description gives the status of the mileage of the Nebraska State Highway System estimated as of January 1, 1938. The total mileage of State and Federal highways when completed equals approximately 11,142 miles. The origin of the 11,142 miles on the Nebraska State Highway System is as follows: From the State system established by the 1919 Legis - lature, of which 5,630 miles are now on the Federal - aid system; and also 571 miles on the old State system which became State highways as provided by law be- - tween 1919 and 1923 by having been built with State and Federal funds prior to establishment of the Fed - eral 7% system in 1923 6,201 miles Statutory highways number 10 to 163 inclusive and not included in the above 6,201 miles, approximately. . 2,401 miles Statutory highways number 164 to 214 inclusive, ap - proximately 1,181, miles Statutory highways number 215 to 292 inclusive, ap - proximately 1,359 miles Approximate total State and Federal-aid highways 11,142 miles The 1935 Legislature amended the then existing laws, which desig - nated the roads under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads and Irrigation, to provide for changes in and additions to the State High - way System. This legislation set up four brackets of statutory high - ways and provided for the sequence in which they were to become parts of the highway system. The 1935 Legislature also provided that routes numbered 90 to 292 inclusive, shall not be maintained by the State until such time as they have been constructed by the Department. It also provided that highways numbered 10 to 89 inclusive, should have preference over highways numbered 90 to 163 inclusive. It provided, however, that numbers 164 to 214 shall not become a part of the State Highway System until such time as not more than 500 miles of highways 10 to 163 inclusive, remain to be graded and adequately surfaced; and provided that numbers 215 to 290 shall not become a part of the State Highway System until such time as not more than 500 miles of high - ways numbered 164 to 214 inclusive, remain to be graded and ade - quately surfaced; and provided that the conditions which restrict the time when highways numbered 164 to 290 will become State Highways shall not apply to those routes in this group which form direct connec - tions between county seats of adjoining counties or to those routes in this group which lead directly to any county seat or to those routes in this group which lead to an incorporated City or Village which is not located on any other Federal or State Highway. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION As of October 1, 1938, the approximate miles in each of the brackets which remain to be graded and adequately surfaced are as follows: Number of Highway Miles Remaining 10 to 89 7777! 77 90 to 163 643 164 to 214 880 215 to 292 1,136 The above figures total 2,736 miles, of which approximately 243 miles are being maintained but have not yet been graded and ade - quately surfaced. At the time when the &lt;vork now under contract is completed the status of the marked and maintained Nebraska State Highway System will be approximately as follows: Paved roads 2,918 miles Gravel roads '5,360 miles Earth 371 miles Total marked and maintained, including feeder roads, approximately 8,649 miles Mileage designated for the State system but not yet maintained, approximately 2,493 miles Approximate total 11,142 miles The above mileages include the following work under construction or under contract, as of December 1, 1938: Paved roads 37 miles Gravel roads 26 miles Earth roads 35 miles Bridges 7 Underpasses 2 Table 5 gives the mileage of each type of construction that was contracted and constructed by the Department of Roads and Irriga - tion each year since 1917. The totals shown in this table are not the same as those given in the preceding paragraph which includes some mileages improved by counties and municipalities, and some natural gravel roads that did not require construction. FEEDER ROADS Federal Feeder Roads were started with 100 per cent Federal funds in 1933, and additional feeder roads have been built in each of the succeeding bienniums. As of October 1, 1938, a total of 708 miles of new feeder roads have been built or contracted. The maintenance on feeder roads is covered by an Act of the 1935 Legislature, which makes it, "the duty of the Department of Roads and Irrigation to maintain the whole of the State Highway System, and any additional highways built In whole or in part with Federal Funds appropriated for highway purposes which are constructed under the exclusive direction of the State Department of Roads and Irrigation including bridges thereon. 11 </seg>
            <seg id="p022">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS Details of former Federal appropriations are given in Table 7. The Federal authorization for Federal-Feeder-Road Funds for 1940 and: 1941 is approximately as follows: 1940 $308,000.00 1941 308,000.00 $616,000.00 - The Federal authorization for regular Federal aid for the fiscal, years 1940 and 1941 is: 1940 $2,054,000.00 1941 2,362,000.00 $4,416,000.00 The Federal Aid appropriations for grade crossing funds which do - not have to be matched for 1940 and 1941 are as follows: 1940 .$348,574.00 1941 522,860.00 $871,434.00 It is anticipated that on June 30, 1939, there will be $1,175,000.00 of Federal Aid funds available, - but which will not have been matched due to lack of sufficient State funds. Adding to the Federal funds which will be unmatched June 30, 1939, the Federal authorizations for the next two years that require matching, there will be a total of $6,207,000.00 which must be matched with State funds if full use is to be made of the Federal funds available during the next biermium. If the present rate of financing is continued, it is estimated that the State will be able to match by June 30, 1941, approximately all the Federal funds available except $500,000.00. Any reduction in the present rate of highway finances will affect this in direct proportion to the reduction made. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION ORGANIZATION The general organization of this Department is the same as in the previous bienniums with the following exceptions: A Division of Design has been created to take over work pre - viously handled by the Division of Maps and Plans and Division of Bridge Design. A Division of Office Administration has been created to take over work previously done by other divisions. A Division of Records and Control has been created to take over the duties of the Clerical and Records Division and to serve as the source of statistical information for the entire Department. Once each month the balances to the credit of every account in the Department are reconciled with the records of the State Auditor and the State Treasurer. Thus the Department is kept in direct contact with the offices which disburse the funds and the office which collects them. In addition to this month - ly check, the Federal Government, through the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, sends an auditor about once each month to this office who checks the final cost on all construction projects in which Federal Funds are involved. After about 18 months of operation under the reorganized divi - sions greater economy and greater efficiency have resulted. PERSONNEL This report would be incomplete without reference to the loyal and efficient services rendered by members of the Department throughout the last two years. The service records of very many of the employees show that they started work with the Department 'when the Depart - ment was organized after the World War and have been continuously employed here for more than 19 years. Throughout these years the standard of service has been continued on a high plane. The Department has been the training ground for many engineers employed throughout the State on engineering work. An average of the period of service of executives shows 14 years. An average of service of project engineers shows 11 years; of instru - ment men 7 years; rodmen 6 years; and chainmen 1 year. In the Main - tenance Department an average of chief patrolmen who are in respon - sible charge generally of about two counties, shows 13 years, resident engineers 12, years, and regular patrolmen 8 years of service. The Executive and Administrative offices of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges are all located in Lincoln, as are also its technical, en - gineering, and principal maintenance repair shop. Close and direct supervision of actual construction and maintenance work is maintained through the District offices. The chart of oranization in the beginning of the book indicates the functions and relationships of various offices and divisions. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER In 1937 the Legislature passed a law relating to public convenience and welfare, and regulating the professional practice of engineering and architecture. This law which went into effect March 27, 1937, created a State Board of Examiners for Professional Engineers and Architects. Following conferences between members of the Nebraska State Board of Examiners for Professional Engineers and Architects and members of this Department, it was determined that the heads of the various divisions and engineers in this Department down to and including the rank of project engineer, and others who were "project engineers in fact if not in title," should qualify as professional engineers under the law. Other engineers and architects employed by the De - partment, irrespective of their grade, were advised to qualify as pro - fessional engineers or architects if possible. However, with the excep - tion of those engineers who held the rank of project engineers or higher, it was optional whether or not they qualified. To December 7, 1938, there have been 184 engineers employed by this Department who have qualified. There are in addition 35 en - gineers whose applications have been filed with the State Board of Examiners and on which action has not been completed. The Depart - ment has endeavored to cooperate fully with the Examining Board and with its employees in order to carry out the intent of the law and to aid in safe-guarding the life, health, and property of the citizens of the State. FOLLOWING QUOTATION IS FROM A CANADIAN NEWSPAPER The Financial Post, a newspaper published in Toronto, Canada, on July 23, 1938, carried the following comments regarding Nebraska Highways, by R. A. Farquharson, staff writer, who had previously visited Nebraska specifically for the purpose of studying the State Gov - ernment of Nebraska: "Motoring through other states en route to Nebraska, where I went to find out how that state does it, and see if there were lessons we could learn hi Canada, I was told many times: 'Sure, they have no debt, but have they anything else?' "If there is a catch I failed to find it. Statistics do not show it: The truth is that Nebraska is not a wealthy state and Nebraskans know it. It does not undertake services it cannot afford! Having no debt, it can control its expenses. When depression comes or drought dries up the taxpayers' sources of income, state expenses are slashed. "But what about the roads? One of the first persons I met in the strikingly beautiful capitol building at Lincoln was Senor Podesta of the Argentine Highways Department, who has settled down for the summer to make a complete study of the Nebraska road building system. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION "They get more roads for less money than any other state in the two Americas, he told me. Nebraska has 8,000 miles of surfaced roads in a $111 million state highway system. Its black top roads are built at a cost of $4,000 a mile on a gravel base. "Senor Podesta was only one of a number of foreign visitors. Engineers have come from South Africa, Australia, Brazil, Cuba to study the economy of Nebraska's road building. The roads are not meant for heavy traffic, such as between Toronto and Niagara Falls. Traffic of 3,000 cars a day would be the Nebraska peak. And eco - nomies in maintenance have been developed to keep pace with new construction. "Having no debt, paying for the roads out of income as they are built, has kept Nebraska free from expensive splurges of road building." COMPENSATION INSURANCE The Department has carried its own compensation insurance, and during the last two years it is estimated that $147,000.00 were saved, which is a sufficient sum to pay all salaries of administrative employees for approximately a 6-month period. ROAD MAPS AND ROAD INFORMATION An effort has been made to keep the public informed as to the condition of our highways at all times. Official maps of Nebraska State Highway System were issued during this biennium on August 1, 1937, and October 1, 1938. Under normal conditions there are daily requests by telephone, letter, or personal call in the office for road information. During high water, snow, ice, and storms, the number of local and long-distance calls, telegrams, and personal inquiries received at the office, show the great interest of the public in road information. The condition of roads at time of storms or washouts is given frequently to the news - papers and broadcasting companies, who keep the traveling public advised as to the condition affecting travel. </seg>

As in the past few years, permanent district headquarters have been maintained at Lincoln, Nor - folk, Grand Island, Bridgeport, McCook, North Platte, and Ainsworth. The duties and activities of the district engineers have increased during this biennium due to additional requirements in connection with an increased mileage under maintenance and an increased number of projects and other activities. In the past two years in all parts of the State special requirements have been made on regular employees and special and favorable com - ment is due them for the satisfactory and economical results accom - plished. In similar manner to the biennial reports since 1920 a brief de - scription of the activities in each district is given below. DISTRICT NO.

Weller was District Engineer for the first five months of 1937, and was succeeded on June 12, 1937 by R. A. House. Headquarters for the district are in Lincoln. The State and Federal highway under State maintenance in this district equals approximately 1,281 miles, on which there has been con - siderable improvement during the last two years. There was an increase of 18 miles of concrete pavement, 97 miles of bituminous surfacing and a decrease in gravel by 17 miles, over the type of construction two years ago. The total miles now consists of 253 miles of paving, 148 miles of bituminous surface, 836 miles of gravel and 44 miles of brick and asphalt. Forty-two miles have been added during this biennium, con - sisting chiefly of feeder roads. The most extensive construction has been in the relocating and rebuilding of existing main highways, improving grades, alignment, and elimination of railroad crossings. Maintenance conditions in this district during 1937 were abnormal due to extreme dry weather. During 1938 maintenance was about normal, having had normal rainfall over most of the district. Fillmore County. The most important construction in this county consisted of the construction of a feeder road for 7.5 miles south of Exeter, Nebraska. Thayer County. The most important construction in this county consisted of the reconstruction of Highway No. 81 from Stoddard to Hebron. It was completed and surfaced with 3-inch stabilized base course and 2-inch bituminous mat.

A graveled road is being constructed from Paw - nee City south, a distance of 4.5 miles. DISTRICT NO. 2 The district is made up of eleven counties lying in the center of the east third of the State. Edwin Olmstead, Lincoln, has been District Engineer since 1928. His headquarters are in Lincoln. The major construction projects completed during the past two years are as follows: Paving the S.Y.A. between Seward and the York-Hamilton County line, which provides a hard-surfaced road between Lincoln and Grand Island. | . Construction of a grade separation at Crowell. This completes the hard surfacing between Omaha and Norfolk. Hard surfacing between Arlington and Blair was completed which closes the gap on Highway No. 30 across Nebraska. Construction and paving of Highway No. 31 between Highway No. 30 Alternate and Highway No. 6 has been completed. This pro - vides a fast connection for the Lincoln-Omaha traffic with the four - lane highway on Dodge Street. The construction included two highway grade separations, one on the Dodge Street Road and one on the Center Street Road. These are the first rural State Highway grade sep - arations built in Nebraska. Relocation and construction on Highway No. 77 between Winslow and TJehling has been completed. This work included a new bridge over the Elkhorn River and a new bridge over Logan Creek. The section of Highway No. 30 Alternate between a point 3 miles west of Osceola and Rising City has been built and hard-surfaced. Highway No. 81 between Columbus and Highway No. 30 Alter - nate has been relocated, constructed and hard-surfaced as has that portion of Highway No. 81 between Columbus and the junction south of Platte Center. That portion of Highway No. 15 between David City and the But - ler-Seward County line was constructed and hard-surfaced. This with other completed projects affords a paved connection between Columbus, Osceola, David City and all intermediate towns with Lincoln. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Highway No. 77 between Lincoln and Wahoo was hard-surfaced as was a relocated section of Highway No. 77 between Fremont and Mead, furnishing a paved surface connecting Fremont and points north, east and west with Lincoln. During 1937 this section of the State suffered another bad drought. The year 1938, however, has been somewhat better, although crops in the west half of the district are far below normal. Due to the shortage of moisture very little trouble has been ex - perienced, either with snow or floods. Maintenance problems have all been of a very routine nature dur - ing the past two years. Some betterments have been made in the district by maintenance forces, most of which have been replacement of obsolete bridges and culverts. The replacements were in every case made with structures salvaged from construction projects. The following is a brief summary of construction done during the past two years by counties: Butler County. Grading and bituminous surfacing was built from Rising City west to the Butler-Polk County line on Highway No. 30 Alternate as was a relocation of Highway No. 81 along the Butler-Polk County line from Highway No. 30 Alternate north to the south side of the Platte River. Bituminous surfacing was also laid on Highway No. 15 between David City and the Butler-Seward County line. A relocation of Highway No. 66 west of Bellwood was graded, clay-surfaced and graveled, eliminating 3 miles of graveled road be - tween David City and Columbus. Colfax County. Two miles of bituminous surfacing was laid on a regraded section of Highway No. 15 immediately north of Schuyler. Dodge County. Work in this county consisted of a grade separa - tion over the Chicago and North Western tracks at Crowell on High - way No. 8; completion of two grade separations in Fremont, one on Highway No. 275 and one on Highway No. 77; grading, construction of two large bridges and graveling on Highway No. 77 between Win - slow and Uehling. Douglas County. Highway No. 31 was paved between the junc - tion north of Gretna and Highway No. 30 Alternate (Dodge Street Road). This work Included a highway grade separation going over Highway No. 16-S and another highway grade separation going under Highway No. 30 Alternate with the necessary "clover-leaf" connections. Platte County. Highway No. 81 was graded and bituminous-sur - faced from Columbus west to the junction south of Platte Center. Bituminous surfacing was laid through Platte Center and an extensive reconditioning of the grade and relocation of a railroad crossing north of Humphrey was undertaken. </seg>
            <seg id="p044">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Polk County. Highway No. 81 was constructed and hard-surfaced from the junction west of Osceola to the south side of the Platte River. This included a major relocation through Osceola, which eliminated several bad turns and two bad hills. Sarpy County. Completion of the bituminous surfacing between Omaha and Fort Crook on the Bellevue Boulevard wa3 accomplished. Work has been started en a relocation of Highway No. 31 between Papillion and Ralston. Saunders County. The Ashland-Ceresco road has been completed and graveled. Highway No. 77 was graded and bituminous-surfaced between Wahoo and the Saunders-Lancaster County line. Between Highway Grade Separation in Douglas County Wahoo and Fremont, Highway No. 77 has been relocated and graded, and bituminous surfacing is being placed. This relocation follows High - way No. 30 Alternate to a point one mile east of Mead; thence straight north to the Fremont bridge. Five miles of concrete pavement were laid west of Wahoo on Highway No. 30 Alternate. Besides the above con - struction work, two narrow bridges were replaced on Highway No. 34, one about 2 miles north of Ashland and one near Ithaca. These were re - placed by the maintenance forces. Structures salvaged from construc - tion projects were used. Several narrow structures on Highway No. 79 between North Bend and Valparaiso were replaced by the same methods. Seward County. Completion of the pavement between Lincoln and Grand Island was accomplished by the construction of a concrete slab between Seward and the junction west of Utica. Contracts have been awarded for the construction and surfacing of approximately 5 miles of new highway between Seward and Dorchester. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Four and one-half miles of the bituminous mat between Seward and Milford were brought up to a higher standard by removal of the old mat, constructing a stabilized base, and replacing the mat. This was done by maintenance forces. Washington County. Grading and hard surfacing the gap on High - way No. 30 between Kennard and Arlington was completed. Highway No. 31 was graveled and placed under State maintenance between Herman and Highway No. 30. York County. Concrete pavement between York and the York- Hamilton County line was completed in 1937. A contract has been let and work has proceeded to an advanced stage on Highway No. 81 between York and the York-Polk County line. This work consists of grading and drainage structures, preparatory to construction of a bituminous surface. In conjunction with this, State forces have graded and graveled the spur from Highway No. 81 to Benedict. DISTRICT NO. 3 This district is comprised of the thirteen counties in the northeast corner of the State. J. B. Martin has been District Engineer for eight and one-half years, with headquarters at Norfolk. A very unusual condition existed during the winter of 1937. Due to the drought of the summer and fall of 1937 only a very minimum amount of vegetation existed. As this vegetation is extremely im - portant in holding snow, we were without this protection. Beginning the night of January 1, 1937, it began snowing and by the morning of January 2, the snow, accompanied by strong winds, blocked all roads. From this time on until the latter part of February, a continu - ous snow removal fight was waged. The amount of snow was not great, but due to the high winds, with no protection afforded by vege - tation, it was impossible to keep the roads open for more than a day or two at a time. The operators and mechanics worked almost con - tinuously during this period, and the results obtained were due only to their untiring efforts and they certainly deserve a world of credit for their work. Outside of this period the rest of the biennium was ■about normal so far as maintenance work is concerned. The improvements in the district due to reconstruction and con - struction were general and these are detailed in the following para - graphs by counties: Antelope County. Construction work was completed on Highway No. 275 from Neligh to Clearwater. This completed Highway No. 275 through the district. , Oil sand surfacing was completed from Clearwater to Ewing. On Highway No. 20 bituminous mat surfacing was completed from a point 2 miles west of Royal west through Royal and Orchard to a point 2 miles west of the Antelope County line. This completes the paving of the surface on Highway No. 20 through the district. </seg>

For convenience in maintenance, Highway No. 2 is included across the northeast corner of Buffalo County and excluded across the southwest corner of Sherman County where it is included in District No. 7. The district is also extended to include 5 miles of Highway No. 281 in Wheeler County. For convenience, Highway No. 39 across the northeast corner of Nance County is included in District No. 2. The area includes approximately 6,551 square miles with total population of approximately 158,500. A. W. Bohner, District Engineer, was temporarily transferred to Lincoln as Acting Construction En - gineer in May, 1938 and since that date L. R. Jones has been Acting District Engineer with headquarters at Grand Island. Construction work during this biennium has consisted chiefly of 25 miles of concrete pavement and 43 miles of stabilized base and bituminous surfacing. This construction was located mostly in the central and south part of the district. Approximately 8 miles of new road have been added, consisting of feeder road extensions, and ap - proximately one mile has been eliminated by grade relocation on High - way No. 11 between North Loup and Ord. The total miles of highway now under maintenance in this district is approximately 1,028 miles. Weather conditions are still not back to normal, in that the two summers have been comparatively dry and we have had several short wet seasons with extremely heavy rains. However, these conditions averaged together have produced a main - tenance condition which would be considered normal and maintenance costs have been average. One of the major maintenance problems has been to control bank erosion along the Middle Loup River north of Cairo and along the same river south of St. Paul. In both cases extensive erosion had threatened the north abutment of our highway bridges. Near St. Paul it was necessary to construct four pile jetties filled with brush and remove the small island in the center of the river to divert the flow towards the center of the bridge. North of Cairo it was possible to control the bank erosion by installing steel retards made up from discarded grader blades. This was accomplished at a very low cost and with effective results. In cooperation with the WPA, it has been possible to improve the storage yard at Grand Island and build five State patrol sheds with fenced yards on State-owned property, thus reducing rental on storage space for equipment and patrolmen headquarters. At Grand Island one-half square block was purchased just west of the State shop, graded and enclosed with a high wire fence. This additional space made it possible to accumulate a great deal of salvaged material </seg>

            <seg id="p053">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION ance. Highway No. 2 now has oiled pavement from Alliance to the east district boundary line at Ashby. A project of 6 miles on Highway No. 26 west of Oshkosh was completed in 1937. Approximately forty per cent of the mileage of roads in District 5 has been oiled. Since the last Biennial Report was written, a subway has been built in Alliance, two crossings eliminated by relocation, one at Hay Springs and one at Lorenzo. Several flashing light signals and armored crossings have been installed on railroads in this district. Weather conditions in District 5 changed materially after April 1, 1938. During the year of 1937, precipitation as recorded at Bridgeport showed a total of 9.33 inches. For the months of January, February and March, 1938, 1.19 inches of precipitation were recorded and for the months of April to September inclusive, 17.55 inches were recorded making a total for the first nine months of 1938 of more than twice the precipitation of the year 1937. Snow fall was very light during the winters of 1936, 1937, and 1938 and snow moving equipment was used very little as roads were blocked only two or three times. Of the increased rainfall during the period April 1st to September 30th, 1938, the principal part of the moisture came in cloudbursts and violent storms which caused serious damage to highways in all parts of the district on several occasions. A brief summary by counties is given below: Banner County. Conditions in this county, which has practically no irrigation, were about the same in 1937 as in 1935 and 1936; however, conditions were much better during 1938 and in general, good crops were raised. Since this county has no railroads, all farm products and live stock must be transported to nearby markets for sale or ship - ment. Highways remain in about the same status as reported in the last Biennial Report except tentative approval has been received of a Federal Feeder Road Project on a county road west of Harrisburg. Box Butte County. This county lies in the dry land farming area and has practically no irrigation . with the exception of a few wells drilled during the past two years. Where irrigation wells are in opera - tion good crops are assured; however, an abundant water supply can - not be obtained in shallow wells. Crops were poor in 1937 but fair in 1938. During the past two years the status of State highways has changed very little, the principal improvement being the reconstruction and oiling of the first 7 miles north of Alliance, building a subway under the C. B. &amp; Q. tracks on West Third Street in Alliance and the con - struction of a 7-mile Federal Feeder Road Project beginning at a point on Highway No. 2, 12 miles west of Hemingford and ending at a point on the Box Butte-Sioux County line 19 miles west of Hemingford. Cheyenne County. During the past two years more irrigation wells have been drilled in this county particularly in the Lodgepole Creek Valley. Crops were poor in 1937 and good in 1938.

Rains during the first two weeks in September, 1938' gave winter wheat an excellent start in all parts of the county. The principal highway changes in Cheyenne County during the past two years consist of the completion of reconstruction and oiling of Highway No. 19 between Huntsman and the north county line anc! the temporary relocation of Highway No. 19 south of Lorenzo which eliminates one railroad crossing in Nebraska and one at Peetz, Colo - rado and reduces the distance between Sidney and Sterling. Earth Construction Near Chadron State Park Cheyenne County's Federal Feeder Road Project has been tenta - tively laid out in the first 6 miles north of Potter; however, this project has not yet been built. Dawes County. This county in common with others in northern Nebraska had poor crops in 1937 and good ones in 1938. The Whitney Irrigation District raised good crops both years. A large acreage in this county has been purchased by the U. S. Government under the Re - settlement Program. The last gap in Highway No. 20 was oiled in 1938. Other highway improvements during the biennium consisted of grading, draining and graveling 7 miles on Highway No. 19 northwest of Chadron and 7 miles on Highway No. 19 south of Chadron, also oiling a project at Whitney. A Federal Feeder Road Project for Dawes County has been tentatively located on the Chadron-Pine Ridge Road northeast of Chadron, but construction has not been started. Deuel County. Pump irrigation is being used in Deuel County in addition to private projects taking water from Lodge pole Creek; how - ever, the irrigable acreage is not large. This county had poor crops in 1937 and good ones in 1938. Winter wheat is the principal crop although a large acreage of corn is raised.

Garden County. The irrigated areas in Garden County raised good crops in 1937 and 1938, but dry land crops were poor in 1937 and fair in 1938. The sand hill district produced good hay and pasture in 1938. Highway improvements in Garden County during the biennium con - sisted of relocating, grading and oiling approximately 6 miles on Highway No. 26 west of Oshkosh and grading, draining and graveling a Federal Feeder Road Project to a point 7 miles north of Oshkosh. Highway No. 26 in Garden County was seriously damaged on several occasions by high water from cloudbursts and unusual maintenance difficulties were encountered throughout the summer of 1938. Kimball County. The irrigated lands of this county raised good crops during 1937 and 1938. The dry land areas had poor crops in 1937 and good ones in 1938. Pump irrigation is being used at many points in the Lodgepole Creek Valley with good results. Highway improvements in Kimball County have been made prin - cipally on Highway No. 29 south of Kimball leaving a gap of approxi - mately 5 miles between the south end of the improved road and the connection with the State of Colorado. The Federal Feeder Road Project for Kimball County was built on Highway No. 29 south of Kimball. Morrill County. Crops in Morrill County in irrigated areas have been good during the biennium, poor on dry lands in 1937, but good in 1938. The irrigable area lies in the Pumpkin Creek and North Platto River Valleys. The sand hill region in the north and northeast part of the county raises good hay and pasture every year. The principal highway improvements in Morrill County during the biennium were oiling from a point 3 miles southwest of Angora on Highway No. 19 to the south county line near Dalton and the con - struction of a new grade between Bayard and South Bayard and widen - ing the bridge over the North Platte River near South Bayard. The Federal Feeder Road Project for Morrill County will be built on High - way No. 88 between Bridgeport and Redington. The completion of oiled paving on Highway No. 19 between Bridge - port and Sidney during the fall of 1938 makes it possible to drive on paving from the North Platte Valley east or west trough several states. Scotts Bluff County. This county, which contains a large area of irrigable land, raises good crops every year except in the dry farm - ing areas and while crops were poor in 1937, on dry land they were fair to good in 1938. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">REPORT | OP THE STATE ENGINEER j • The principal highway improvements in Scotts Bluff County dur - ing the biennium consisted of regrading and oiling from Goring- to the south county line on Highway No. 29, reconstructing and oiling from South Mitchell to a point one mile north of Mitchell and reconstruct - ing and oiling from Gering to a point connecting with the pavement that leads to the top of Scotts Bluff National Monument. A tentative Federal Feeder Road Project for Scotts Bluff County begins at South Mitchell and runs in a southeasterly direction to connect with a project being improved to the west boundary line of the Scotts Bluff National Monument on Highway No. 86. Sheridan County. This county, particularly the north one-third, did not raise good crops in 1937 and 1938 although the remainder of the county, which is principally a sand hill district, raised good pas - ture and hay. Crops were probably better in 1938 than in 1937 but not as good as in other counties of the district. Highway No. 20 is now completely oiled in Sheridan County and a relocation at Hay Spring? eliminates two railroad crossings. The Federal Feeder Road Project for Sheridan County has been tentatively located south of Gordon on Highway No. 27 but no construction work has been started. Sioux County. With the exception of irrigable areas in the south part of the county and some private projects along White River and Hat Creek this county has no irrigable land and although the re - mainder of the acreage consists of sand hills and timber land, some farming is carried on in ' all parts of the county. Crops were poor in 1937 and fair to good in 1938. Many cattle are raised in Sioux County. Highway No. 87 from Scottsbluff to Hemingford traverses the south and east sections of the county and during the biennium all but 12 miles in Sioux County was constructed. The Federal Feeder Road Project in Sioux County jwas constructed from Harrison north a dis - tance of 4 miles. ;. . i ■ ■ ■ ■ . .;-..;: DISTRICT NO. 6 This district is composed of the thirteen counties south of the Platte River in the southwestern corner of the State. F. C. Smith has been District Engineer for twelve years with headquarters at Mc- Cook. The Republican River, which is formed by the confluence of the north and south forks of, the Republican and the Arickaree in Dundy County and the Frenchman River which enters the State in Chase County are the principal; streams in the territory. They flow in an easterly direction and are fed by numerous creeks and dry canyons on each side. The Platte River skirts the district on the north but only the runoff from a part of the north tier of counties goes into this stream. The three principal highways in this district are Highway No. 6, Highway No. 3 and Highway No. 34. Highway No. 6 transverses </seg>
            <seg id="p057">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION the district from the east boundary to the Nebraska-Colorado line on the west. Highway No. 3 follows the Republican River from the east boundary of the district to the junction of Highway No. 3 with No. 6 and No. 34 at Oxford. Highway No. 34, which is marked in conjunction with Highway No. 6 from Hastings to Oxford, leaves Highway No. 6 at Culbertson to follow the Republican River Valley to the State line west of Haigler. Weather conditions have been normal during the past two years in all counties comprising- this district. The rainfall during this period was below normal in most sections. Maintenance has been generally good in all counties. The most important development during the last two years was the completion of a paved road on Highway No. 6 across the district thereby completing the hard surfacing of this highway across the State. Considerable progress was also made toward the completion of High - way No. 34 from Culbertson west to the State line. However, the con - struction work was not confined to these two highways as practically every highway in the district received a substantial improvement during the biennium. Chase County. In this county whose county seat is Imperial, construction work during the biennium has been on Highway No. 6. Grading and bituminous surfacing were constructed through Wauneta and from Imperial west to the State line. Bituminous surfacing was laid in Imperial between the 20-foot concrete pavement and the curb for the entire length of the city main street which is a part of High - way No. is. Dundy County. During the past two years important construc - tion projects have been completed on Highway No. 34 in this county whose county seat is Benkelman. Prom Parks through Haigler to the State line the highway has been graded and surfaced with bitumin - ous pavement. From the east county line the highway has been regraded and new structures installed as far west as Highway No. 61 in Benkelman. This work was done in 1938 preparatory to bitumin - ous surfacing. Franklin County. In this county where the county seat is located in the city of Franklin, the highway from Highway No. 4 north to the county line at Wilcox was graded and graveled with State and Fed - eral feeder road funds. Considerable improvement was effected on Highway No. 3 by reshaping and regraveling with maintenance funds. Frontier County. Stockville is the county seat of this county. During the past two years Highway No. 23-N has been completed across the county thereby completing the graveling of all highways in the county. Grading and 'graveling and the construction of a large bridge between Curtis and Moorefield was completed in 1937 and grading, graveling and a large bridge was completed between Moore - field and Farnam in 1938. </seg>

This new - route which runs through Furnas, Harlan and Phelps Counties, when -completed will be approximately 8 miles shorter than the present route between these poirts. A spur 4 miles in length on the Furnas- Harlan County line will connect Oxford with this new highway loca - tion. Grading and structures were completed on the cutoff and spur in 1938, preparatory for bituminous pavement. On Highway No. 21, flashing light signals were installed at the crossing of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad in Arapahoe. State and Federal feeder road funds were used to complete the Cambridge north highway north to the county line. Gosper County. This county whose county seat is Elwood is served by Highways Nol 23-N, No. 23-S, ,No. 23 and No. 21, all of which are graveled. Maintenance conditions have been normal in this county during the biennium. Harlan County. In this county whose county seat is Alma, a bituminous surface treatment was applied to the present location of Highway No. 6 from Oxford northeast to the Phelps County line. Grad - ing and structures were [completed on that part of the new location of Highway No. 6 and the Oxford north J spur which were described under Furnas County. A bituminous surface treatment was applied on Highway No. 83 from Alma south to the State line, completing the hard surfacing of this highway across the county. Hayes County. The county seat of this county is Hayes Center. Bituminous mat was constructed on Highway No. 6 between Palisade and Hamlet, completing the hard surfacing of this highway across the county. On Highway No. 17 west of Hayes Center, 10 miles were graded and graveled and on 14 miles grading and structures were completed, greatly improving this highway between Hayes Center and the Perkins County line. Nineteen miles ; of this improvement were on a relocation. State and Federal feeder road funds were used to construct one mile of heavy grading and a large bridge on the Hayes Center east road. Hitchcock County. Trenton is the county seat of this county. Highway No. 6 was completed across the ! county by the construction of a new grade and bituminous pavement between Culbertson and Palisade. Great improvement was accomplished on Highway No. 34 by the completion of projects between Culbertson and Trenton and be - tween Stratton and the Dundy County line, which included construc - tion in both Trenton and Stratton.

The first bituminous surface on Highway- No. 183 in Red Willow County was completed from McCook, the county seat, south to the Kansas State line. A new district maintenance shop and storage building for maintenance machinery was constructed as a WPA project at McCook. These buildings are of concrete construc - tion with metal roofs and are constructed on a 3-acre tract of land adjacent to the railroad tracks which facilitates the unloading of oil, bridge plank and other commodities received in car-load shipments. A 12,000 gallon tank for road oil is equipped with an electric pump and a steam heater. The yard which is well fenced furnishes the storage space necessary for the maintenance headquarters of the district. DISTRICT NO. 7 This district is composed of the following twelve counties located in the west central part of the State: Arthur, Blaine, Buffalo, Custer, Dawson, Grant, Hooker, Keith, Lincoln, Logan, McPherson and Thomas. Except for the four counties along the Platte River, the district lies almost entirely in the sparsely-populated sand-hill area of the State. John McMeekin has been District Engineer for a period of three and one-half years. District headquarters are located at North Platte. The principal highways of the district are: Highway No. 30 which follows the Platte Valley across the south side of the district. Highway No. 2, running from the southeast corner of the district across the sand hills to the northwest corner, a dis - tance of approximately 200 miles. Highway No. 83, running north and south along the east side of the district. Important construction projects on existing routes during the biennium are as follows: Completion of the viaduct in North Platte, over the Union Pacific tracks on Highways No. 30 and No. 183. Bituminous surfacing and improvement on Highway No. 2 from Broken Bow southeast to Hazard. Completion of the surfacing on Highway No. 16 between North Platte and Stapleton. In addition to the projects on the existing routes, several projects were constructed and added to the system, on roads not previously maintained by the Department; the most important ones being Ansley south on Highway No. 61, Lexington to Oconto on Highway No. 21, Miller-Watertown in Highway No. 40, and Mullen south. Maintenance operations during the biennium were mostly routine. No severe snow storm occurred. However, extremely heavy rain the past year did considerable damage to the roads and structures, necessitating more than normal expenditures for repairs. Due to the </seg>
            <seg id="p061">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION dry weather and high winds of the past several years, it was neces - sary to resurface with clay many of the roads in the sand hill sec - tion of the district. In co-operation with Works Progress Administration, new patrol sheds were built for shops and to house State equipment at Kearney, Elm Creek and Arnold. Comments, conditions, and a brief resume of construction work in various counties during the biennium are as follows: Buffalo County. Buffalo County is located in the extreme south - eastern corner of the district, the Platte River forming the south boundary line. This county is well served by the following important roads: Highway No. 30 across the south side of the county, graveled Highways No. 63 and No. 83 running north and south, and Highway No. 40, running from Kearney northwesterly to Miller. The principal crops of the county are potatoes, corn, alfalfa and sugar beets. Weather conditions have been very unfavorable to crops, except in the irri - gated sections of the county. Rainfall during the past year was slightly above normal; however, it did not fall at a time when it was of ma - terial benefit to the crops. The grading and gravel surfacing on Highway No. 40 between Watertown and Miller were completed during the past year. A re - location on Highway No. 30 in Kearney eliminated the narrow bridge and poor alignment. A roadside improvement project, consisting of the planting of various trees and shrubs, was built between Elm Creek and Odessa. Although the planting is less than a year old, a good growth, with little loss, is noted. New patrol sheds were built at Kearney and Elm Creek. Custer County. This county is located at the east edge of the sand-hill region. The topography is very rough and the construction and maintenance of roads is expensive. Although the important roads in the county are rapidly being hard-surfaced, there is still a con - siderable mileage of gravel roads, the maintenance of which is ex - pensive, as surfacing material is not found locally, but must be shipped or trucked from long distance. This materially increases the main - tenance costs in the county. Ranching and farming are the principal occupations of the county. Conditions for farming have not been favorable. Very little farm crops were produced during the past two years, however there was sufficient rainfall to provide plenty of pasture and hay in the ranch - ing districts. Notable improvements made in the county during the past two years were: The improvement of Highway No. 2 from Broken Bow southeast to Litchfield. Approximately 30 miles of this highway have been brought to permanent line and grade; 22 miles have been hard surfaced. Six miles between Ansley and Miller were graded and graveled, leaving only 3 miles of Highway No. 61 not constructed. </seg>
            <seg id="p062">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER Highway No. 21, from Oconto south to the county line was con - structed, completing the road from Lexington to Broken Bow. A roadside improvement project was built in the vicinity of Ansley along Highway No. 2. This consisted of the planting of various trees and shrubs, and the development of two roadside parks. A new patrol shed and yard for State equipment is being built at Ansley at the junction of Highways No. 2, No. 16, No. 83 and No. 63. Oawson County. The largest irrigated section of the district is in Dawson County. Alfalfa is the principal crop of the county. In addition to a large amount of baled alfalfa shipped, much is processed locally to make livestock feed, all of which is shipped by rail to the East. Although crops in the dry land section of the county were below normal during the past two years, this county was not affected as much as other counties of the district. The principal highways are No. 30, No. 21, and No. 47. Highway No. 30, running diagonally across the county, is hard-surfaced. Work in the county during this biennium consisted of the construction of new roads. Little improvement was made on existing routes. Six miles of grade were built and gravel placed on Highway No. 21 between Lexington and Oconto, and the remainder graded to the Custer County line. Concrete curbing and storm sewer, in connection with the road - side improvement project, were built in Cozad. It is expected that planting will be done during the coming spring. Keith County. This county is located in the southwestern corner of the district and is crossed by both the North and South Platte Rivers. The area to the north of the North Platte River is in the sand-hill region. Considerable irrigation is carried on in the Platte Valley. Conditions in the county are typical of other counties in this locality. ■ Work in the county during the biennium consisted of the improve - ment of existing routes, notably the construction of a new bridge and channel west of Ogallala to intercept drainage from the canyon to the north of the city. This relieved the highway and town of Ogallala from overflow during periods of heavy rains. Considerable improvement- was made on Highway No. 30, between Paxton and Ogallala. The work consisted of grading, stabilization and the re - construction of the oil mat. Patrol headquarters for the western part of the district are located at Ogallala, where shops are located for the repair of equipment. Lincoln County. Lincoln County is one of the three largest coun - ties of the State; located at the confluence of the North and South Platte Rivers. In addition to the large irrigated section in the western part of the county, there is considerable dry land farming and ranch - ing. Crop conditions were better than other counties in the district. The best sugar beet crop in years was harvested during the past </seg>
            <seg id="p063">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION two years. A better than average wheat crop was raised last year in the dry-land farming area. In addition to the usual routine maintenance, the oil sand on Highway No. 183 was reconstructed during 1937. District headquar - ters are located in North Platte, where shops for the repair and re - building of equipment are maintained. The most important work during the biennium was: Completion of the North Platte Viaduct on Highways No. 30 ■ and No. 183 over the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. This structure eliminated the last grade crossing between Highway i i • ' ? 'I 3j It T.^H I A i I ft 1 Ti If /t^^^^l I Viaduct over Union Pacific Tracks at North Platte No. 30 and the Union Pacific. In addition to carrying the Lincoln Highway traffic, the structure also relieves the con - gestion and delay of the heavy local traffic at this point. Six miles on Highway No. 23, Wallace to Grainton, were graded and graveled during the biennium. Highway No. 16 between North Platte and Stapleton was con - structed completing the surfacing between these towns. Arthur and McPherson Counties. These two counties are located in the sparsely populated sand-hill region of the State. Neither county is served directly by a railroad, but must depend upon highways for the transportation of material and supplies. Cattle raising and ranch - ing is the chief industry. No new construction projects have been started during the bien - nium. Work in these counties was confined to the improvement and repair of existing routes. Due to the dry weather conditions of the past few years, it was necessary to reclay and regravel Highway No. 61 from Arthur to Ogallala. Considerable reconstruction was done on Highway No. 183. between North Platte and Tryon. Six miles of </seg>
            <seg id="p064">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER bituminous sand was reconstructed and a part of Highway No. 183 was resurfaced with clay. Although traffic on the roads of these counties is light, maintenance of shoulders, surfaces and signs is high, due to the movement of large herds of cattle twice each year, from the range land to the Platte Valley and railroad shipping points. Blaine, Grant, Hooker and Thomas Counties. These counties are located in the center of the sand-hill region of the State. In common with the other sand-hill counties, the area is sparsely populated. The Middle Loup River, starting in Grant County, flows eastward, cross - ing all four counties. The chief industry of this territory is ranching and cattle raising. Very little grain crops are raised. Conditions have been particularly favorable to the industry the past two years. Rainfall has been sufficient to make pasture and hay crops above normal. On Highway No. 2, bituminous sand mat was laid a distance of 3 miles between Mullen and Seneca, and 8 miles from Hyannis east were reclayed during the year. A short project was constructed south of Mullen toward North Platte on Highway No. 183, and from Brewster north on Highway No. 7, using Secondary Road Funds. Six miles of bituminous sand west of Mullen was reconstructed on Highway No. 2, during the biennium. Logan County. The north part of this county, where ranching is carried on extensively, lies in the sand hills. Small grain farming is carried on in the Loup Valley in the southern part. Conditions during the past year have been favorable for crops, although some damage from grasshoppers occurred. No new construction projects were built in the county during the biennium. Maintenance operations were of the usual routine.- DISTRICT NO. 8 This district is composed of the following nine counties located in the north-central part of the State: Boyd, Brown, Cherry, Garfield, Holt, Keya Paha, Loup, Rock and Wheeler. C. Lyle Carey, with head - quarters at Ainsworth, has been District Engineer for three and one - half years. Approximately 95 per cent of this district lies in the sand-hill region and contributes to the wealth of the State through the production of the finest feeder cattle in the world. Highway No. 20 is the principal highway across the district, ex - tending from east to west for a distance of 220 miles. This highway is the principal trade artery to the livestock markets. Continued de - velopment of hard surfacing on this route has also increased ma - terially the tourist traffic from eastern states to the Black Hills and National Park regions. Highway No. 281 from Bartlett to O'Neill to South Dakota State line, Highway No. 11 from Burwell to Atkinson to Butte, and Highway </seg>
            <seg id="p065">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION No. S3 from Taylor to Bassett to South Dakota State line are the principal north and south routes. Important construction projects completed during this biennium in - clude oil-sand surfacing of the O'Neill-Ewing, Stafford-Orchard, Bas - sett west, Leat to the west Cherry County line, and Valentine-Thed - ford projects. Grade construction of the Stuart-Bassett projects in preparation for oil surfacing has been completed. Completion of the last section of unimproved highway between Burwell and Ericson has provided an east and west route of considerable importance to the southern part of the district. Secondary highways of local importance have been improved or are under contract for improvement as follows: Ainsworth to Brew* ster, Springview to Brocksburg, Naper to Stuart, Butte' to Atkinson, Page to Highway No. 20, Chambers west, Ballagh east and Taylor to Almeria. Maintenance conditions have been complicated by decreased rain« fall during the late summer and fall months of each- year of the past biennium. Light clay-surfaced mats broke up badly, necessitating con - siderable reclaying, and in some instances, hauling of a considerable amount of water to avoid serious deterioration. A period of extremely low temperatures with considerable snow fall during the early months of 1937 entailed considerable expense in snow removal, particularly in Holt and Boyd Counties. State-owned patrol sheds have been con - structed at Springview and at Rose, which are of considerable benefit in the maintenance of patrols in these localities. Boyd County. This county lies between the Missouri and Nio brara Rivers. Farming is the principal industry and under normal conditions, excellent crops are raised. Depleted rainfall and unsatis - factory market prices for grain crops have created a serious financial condition for many residents of the county. The regrading of Highway No. 281 from Spencer to the South Dakota State line has been an improvement which should be of great help in keeping this highway open during the winter months. Construction of the Naper south and Butte south projects will permit travel at any time over roads which formerly were impassable during certain seasons of each year. Cherry County. Commoly known as "The Home of a Million Cattle," this county has benefited materially from excellent range conditions which have prevailed during the past biennium. Pastures have been excellent and the hay crop satisfactory. Further extension of an oil-surfaced road on the Valentine-Thedford route is providing an inlet for feeder cattle buyers to the heart of the sand-hill country. Sportsmen from many States are taking advantage of this route as well as the surfaced and graveled road across the Niobrara National Forest Reserve south of Nenzel, in order to enjoy the hunting and fish - ing privileges found on Cherry County lakes. (3) </seg>
            <seg id="p066">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER Brown and Rock Counties.. Conditions in the range sections of these counties have been similar to those in Cherry County. The agri - cultural sections of the counties have not fared so well. Completion of another section of the Ainsworth-Brewster route is developing a vast trade territory as well as hastening the completion of a needed connection between Highway No. 20 and Highway No. 2. The oil sur - facing of a section of Highway No. 20 west of Bassett has shortened this route by nearly 2 miles and replaced 6 miles of the old route which required a considerable maintenance expenditure. Grading of a new relocation between Bassett and Stuart on Highway No. 20 has also resulted in some saving in distance. A secondary project north of Newport is developing a territory which has been seriously handicapped by lack of good roads. Holt County. This county has benefited, particularly during the past year from abundant grain, hay and forage crops. Cattle buyers from eastern Nebraska, as well as many eastern states, have found it advantageous to visit Holt County to obtain the finest of range cattle for their feed lots. The construction of oil-surfaced highways from O'Neill to Ewing on Highway No. 275 and Stafford to Orchard on Highway No. 20 has eliminated considerable mileage between O'Neill and Omaha, and O'Neill and Sioux City, and should result in a larger volume of traffic on these highways. Secondary projects are being started from Page south and Chambers west. Keya Paha County. Crop conditions have been better than average in this county. An abundance of hay and forage crops are available for feeding or for sale to less favored localities. An extension of the Springview-Brocksburg route has been completed which will be of ma - terial benefit to this county. Garfield and Loup Counties. A dream of many years is being realized In the construction of the North Loup River Public Power and Irrigation system. Unemployment has been relieved to a large ex - tent by this construction and bounteous crops were harvested in 1938 after water for irrigation was available. Improvement and maintenance of Highway No. 53 from Taylor west through Almeria has resulted in a considerable increase in traffic on this route. Construction of the Ballagh east project will be of particular importance to the northeast part of Garfield County. Wheeler County. Crop conditions have not been as satisfactory in this county as in some others although a large amount of stock has been' brought in from less favored localities, to be fed. The county is served by Highway No. 281 extending north and south across the county and by Highway No. 53 extending in an east and west direction. Com - pletion of the last unimproved section of Highway No. 53 between Eric - son and Burwell is of great importance to Wheeler County as it provides a first-class route to the irrigated sections to the west. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF DESIGN ORGANIZATION As indicated by the organization chart of the Department, the principal function of this division is the design work and preparation of plans for all highway construction. This includes program prepara - tion, road location, preliminary surveys, plan plotting, road, bridge, culvert, pavement and roadside improvement design, as well as the preparation of all maps and charts incidental to the work of the Department as a whole. Because of the wide scope of the work assigned to it, this divi - sion is divided into smaller departments. These subdivisions consist principally of the following departments: preliminary survey, maps and plans, bridge, culvert, roadside improvement, and rigid and flexible type pavement design, each of which is specifically responsible for the preparation of the work for which it is best qualified to handle. In planning future work which involves the use of Federal and State funds, specific programs are used. As stated previously, the work of formulating these programs rests in this division. Such pro - grams show the approximate length of each project included therein, together with the approximate amount of Federal and State funds to be used and the type of construction contemplated. These programs are prepared to cover the contemplated work for each fiscal year. ROAD DESIGN After the approval of these programs has been secured from the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, the general location of each project is determined by the design engineer. The specific location, however, is left to the determination of the field party making the preliminary survey. The next step is to have a preliminary survey made of the par - ticular road or section of road to be improved. This consists of a continuous profile with cross sections taken at regular intervals or at points where the gradient of the profile breaks, and a description of the various drainage structures, together with the size of the drain - age area being served by the structure crossing the highway at this . point. All field data for this survey are recorded on loose-leaf notebook paper and is submitted to the Lincoln office for plotting. After the plan and profile sheets have been plotted from all available field data, they contain all necessary information relative to the drainage and soil conditions which will be encountered in the construction of this section of the road. A tentative grade line is shown on the cloth in pencil, after which blue-printed copies are made. These copies are given to the design engineer, who, usually in company with the district </seg>

            <seg id="p069">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION are now made in a manner whereas it is unnecessary to make addi - tional preconstruction surveys. Less engineering work has been re - quired on the part of the construction engineering' parties and has re - sulted in a saving in construction engineering expense. Some outstanding developments have been made during the bien - nium, especially in bituminous surface and bridge designs. A new guard rail plan has been developed which has resulted in the construc - tion of a higher type rail at a more reasonable cost. Details of new developments and work of special interest in the various types of construction may be noted in the discussions on bridges, bituminous surfaces, and roadside improvement. During the biennium, a serious attempt has again been made to eliminate entirely, overtime work, or at least hold it to an absolute minimum. A small amount of such work has been necessary, how - ever, in order to prepare plans for the utilization of funds within the period of the allotment. The overtime involved, nevertheless, has been negligible compared to the quantity of work turned out by this divi - sion. The same spirit of loyalty and zealousness has been expressed by the personnel of this division that has characterized it during every other previous biennium. BRIDGE DESIGN During this biennium there were 151 structures placed under con - tract up to November 1, 1938. In addition, the State constructed two highway grade separations with State forces. Of this total of 153 projects, 17 were repairs of rather major im - portance, 18 were in the nature of bank and bridge protection work, and 5 consisted of a variety of small special structures. The remain - ing 113 projects comprise new construction throughout, including all grade separations. Of this number 9 were strictly grade separations, 3 of which were subways. By "subways" we mean the condition where a highway is made to pass underneath a railroad line or another exist - ing highway. The best example of the highway subway is the so-called Dodge-Street Subway where the grade of Highway No. 31 was de - pressed and made to pass under the four-lane Dodge-street artery. This particular job was done by State forces with the assistance of WFA labor, all under State supervision. A feature of this construc - tion was the ingenious spectacle of building the underpass structure at Dodge Street in two distinct operations whereby continuous heavy traffic was maintained over Dodge Street throughout the construc - tion. This structure is a 3-span concrete rigid frame type. For purposes of comparison, the following table is made to show the numerical ratio of five distinct divisions of construction according to type of design, and includes corresponding columns from the pre - ceding biennium: </seg>

This tendency has been given impetus by certain developments and refine - ment of design in the concrete-slab type of structure and the stan - dardization of same. We now have single, continuous twin and triple span standards in varying lengths. These are susceptible to a wide choice of combinations to the end that multiple-span structures may be fitted to a surprising number of different field conditions. The deck-steel-girder type of bridge shows but a slight decrease in percentage from the preceding biennium. As might be expected the steel-truss type of bridge is being used sparingly, due to the better adaptation of deck construction to the Nebraska terrain and stratigraphy. The following table will illustrate a more detailed distribution of structure groups.

This biennium did not see as large a number of new grade separations as the previous one, but it is of note that some new varieties of separations are distinctive. There were only 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p071">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION railroad viaducts and 3 highway viaducts. There were 2 railroad sub - ways and 1 highway subway. Of the 9 grade separations only 5 sep - arated highway from railroad grades, while 4 of them, separated high - way grades, one from another. One of these 4 being the Dodge-Street subway mentioned more in detail heretofore. Repairs. The 17 repair jobs, tabulated above were, for the most part, repairs and improvements of major -importance consisting prin - cipally of widening narrow roadway bridges. These repair or widening jobs may, in general, be divided into three distinct classes as follows: (a) Widening of old concrete-arch or girder bridges from 12 - or 16-foot roadway to 22- or 24-foot roadway. (b) Widening of old 16- and 20-foot roadway, steel-truss spans to 24-foot roadway. (c) Widening old I-beam, transverse- joist, or girder bridges from 16- or 20-foot widths to a full 24-foot width between curbs. Good examples of the widening of steel-truss spans may be seen south of Wahoo at the crossing of Highway No. 77 over Wahoo Creek, and in Richardson County on joint Highways No. 73 and No. 75. Trusses of 90-, 100- and 120-foot spans were widened by the introduction of heavier new floor beams and certain revisions to lateral bracings and, in one instance, diagonal web members. The old reinforced con - crete structural floors were removed and shallow prefabricated steel grid, concrete-filled flooring members were substituted therefor. This lightening of dead load permitted the continued use of live loads equal to or greater than those for which the original structures were designed. Examples of widening old concrete girder and arch bridges may be seen at Bayard and at Central City respectively. Where the highway crosses the North Flatte River, 2 miles south of Bayard, the old concrete .girder bridge was widened from a 12-foot clear to a 24-foot clear roadway. The concrete piers were extended by driving two steel piles in line with and at each end of each pier. Two new longitudinal steel girders were then placed over each of these pier extensions and a concrete slab was poured over the old bridge deck, extending out over the girder and cantilevered a slight distance further outside of each outside steel girder. The construc - tion was completed by installing high safety concrete curbs support - ing a light weight structural steel handrail. The bridge is 779 feet long. The Central City bridge, which carries Highway No. 14 over the Flatte River south of Central City, was a spandrel-filled concrete arch with heavy ornamental concrete rails and a 16-foot roadway, 886 feet, 10 inches long. This structure was paved and widened to a clear width of 22 feet by removing the old concrete rails and the placing of a concrete slab with safety curbs and light steel handrail. The extra width was secured by cantilevering the slab over the concrete spandrel walls. </seg>
            <seg id="p072">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER It Is perhaps a misnomer to classify these 17 projects as "repairs" because in every instance the resultant structure is equivalent to a new structure. They differ from all other new structures only in that the major parts of the substructure and certain parts of the superstruc - ture, which were found to be substantial and durable, were used in place. This salvage of structural matter is a distinct achievement in the realm of economic conservation. It is estimated that the saving 1 effected by this treatment of these 17 projects, under the cost of re - placing them with new structures throughout, would amount to up - wards of $90,000.00. Protection Work. Table 11 shows that during the biennium, $52,878.30 was expended in protection work. This item includes protec - tion of bridge heads for various structures constructed, and in addition, Bridge over Turkey Creek, East of Arapahoe with New Type of Concrete Slope Protection ■ . includes all special bank protection including willow mats, tree riprap, stone and concrete riprap, and jetties. Miscellaneous Activity. The subdivision of Bridge Design indulged in quite a variety of activity not strictly within the scope of general road and bridge location, design, and construction. Considerable time and effort were rendered to the Division of Maintenance in matters of bridge repair and adjustment, river pro - tection, and more particularly with the structural design and detail of various patrol sheds and other structures. Engineering- consultation and service are, from time to time, given the State Planning Board in such matters as the rating of bridges and other structures both on and off the State system of highways. </seg>

            <seg id="p077">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Another activity, for which no items are shown in any of the tables of expenditures exhibited in this section of the report, is the engineering service and supervision furnished in connection with the several PWA projects now under way within this State. This service consisted of reviewing' PWA project designs and details, and in peri - odical inspections of construction work. Some little technical service and time is given to the Bureau of Irrigation in connection with both PWA projects and with matters pertaining to applications for public water use, where the same may involve structural features in plans for storage and diversion works. CULVERT DESIGN Preparation of plans for special culverts, arches, and miscellaneous drainage structures are important phases of the work of this depart - ment. Culverts range in size from 2x2 to 12x12 feet and from 1 to 10 spans. Arches range in size from 10x10 to 22x22 feet and from 1 to 4 spans. With the use of vibrators when placing concrete, the adoption of intermediate grade of reinforcing steel, and the more rigid inspection, there has been a marked trend toward the use of higher working stresses in the design of structures. In April, 1937, the standard plans for concrete box culverts were revised in accordance with the recommendations and suggestions re - ceived from the Federal Bureau. These revisions, made possible by an increase in the allowable working stresses in concrete and steel, resulted in a substantial decrease in the cost of our box culverts. One of the most destructive forces that the engineer is called on to combat is that of soil erosion. With this in mind, an effort is made to so design our structures that they will best serve the locality in respect to soil conservation needs as well as drainage. SOIL STUDIES Because of the continuous development in the design and construc - tion of adequate lower-cost pavements for Nebraska highways, inten - sive studies of the road-building properties of the soils of the State are becoming more and more necessary and important. The economy of building pavements consisting of stabilized soil base courses with some type of bituminous wearing surface depends primarily upon the extent to which local materials, available in the vicinity of each job, are util- </seg>
            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER The first step in making a soil survey on a project is to determine the classifications of the soils encountered, the names of such soil types, and the locations of the boundaries of each. Borings are then made with a soil auger at frequent intervals and each soil type .is classified into layers. The profile of each layer is then plotted on a cross-section sheet, together with the proposed grade line of the road. Representative samples' of the materials from each layer are sent to the laboratory where complete tests are made to determine their road-building characteristics. Special soil formations or unusual con - ditions uncovered by the soil survey are subjected to detailed study in the field. Conditions which might be conducive to the formation of frost boils in the completed road are given special attention. An inventory of soil material resources consists of locating and investigating sources of gravel, rock, sand, soil binder, mineral filler, sand clay, and borrow. Samples of these materials are selected and sent to the testing laboratory where tests reveal the road-building properties of each. Research is being carried on continuously in conjunction with rou - tine design and construction work. New methods are being developed for improving road foundation conditions, for preventing difficulties from subsurface water and frost heave, for utilizing local materials in the construction of base and surface courses, and for stabilizing all types of soils encountered. During the past several years, a considerable amount of informa - tion has been acquired concerning the various soils encountered in high - way construction in Nebraska. This information, however, is of lim - ited value when it is not associated with definite soil groups. Labora - tory test results are of greater value if, in addition to revealing prop - erties of a certain sample of soil, they also provide general informa - tion as to what may be expected of the soil type whenever it is en - countered. This can be accomplished only by relating test results and other soil experiences to a unit of soil classification. By this means a source of information can be built up which will increase the efficiency of road design, lengthen the life of, and improve the quality of the highway. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF OFFICE ADMINISTRATION The principal functions of the Division of Maps and Plans, as it existed prior to April 1, 1937, were divided on that date between two new divisions, the Division of Design and the Division of Office Ad - ministration. All preliminary plans and preliminary estimates are prepared by the Division of Design and the preliminary plans and other prelim - inary documents for all work which will involve the use of Federal funds are submitted by that division to the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads for their approval. After the preliminary plans and the re - lated documents are approved by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, they are delivered to the Division of Office Administration, which per - forms other duties necessary for receiving bids and letting the work to contract. Other of the more important functions of this division are the checking of final quantities and estimates for all completed work, except bridge construction work; preparing estimates for all work which involves the expenditure of Federal funds after bids for the work are received and submitting those estimates to the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads; all blue printing; purchasing and distributing gen - eral office supplies and field engineering supplies and equipment; reconditioning and repairing engineering equipment and dispatching all outgoing mail that originates in any of the offices of the Department of Roads and Irrigation which are located in the State Capitol. After projects have been approved by the TJ. S. Bureau of Public Roads and dates for receiving bids have been determined, this division prepares the Notices to Contractors and publishes them in the proper newspapers as prescribed by statute. This division also forwards copies of all such notices to prospective bidders. The bidders' pro - posal forms are prepared and furnished to the bidders by this divi - sion. The major portion of the routine work necessary to prepare for and to hold lettings is done under the direct supervision of this divi - sion. All bids for work which is let to contract by the Department of Roads and Irrigation are opened, read and tabulated publicly at the appointed time. The bids for work on each project then are calcu - lated, the total amount of each' bid is determined and the low bidder or low bidders are selected. A detail estimate for work on each project, showing the preliminary quantities and low bid prices is prepared after the district engineer of the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads has concurred in the selection of the low bidders and contracts have been awarded. Normally, this estimate then is submitted to the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads and when approved is used as the basis for the "Project Agree - ment" or the contract between the Federal Government and the State for the work on the project which is involved. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER The Division of Office Administration is charged with the re - sponsibility of furnishing plans to prospective bidders and approved plans to those contractors to whom contracts are awarded. Complete plans are displayed in the Lincoln office and three complete sets of prints of the plans for work on each project are furnished the county clerk of the county in which the proposed work is located, prior to the date of receiving bids for any work. The county clerk is advised that two of the three sets of plans which are sent to him are fur - nished so that they may be loaned to prospective bidders who may desire to borrow them with the understanding that they will be re - turned, to him after the prospective bidder has examined the site of the proposed work. Complete plans for the work in his. district also are sent to each of the six district engineers whose offices are not located in the State Capitol. Measurements are made and recorded by the field engineers after the contractor has completed the work on a project. The final quantities for the items of work are computed either by the field en - gineers, or in this division, from the measurements which the field engineers have made. In either case, the quantities are checked and the final estimate of the amount earned by the contractor is prepared in this division. During certain seasons, the volume of this work in - creases very materially and it is necessary to assign a large number of field engineers to this division in order that the final estimates may be released as promptly as possible. A large part of the general office supplies and almost all field engineering equipment and supplies which are used by the Department of Roads and Irrigation are purchased and distributed by this division. The needs of the entire Department for general office supplies are estimated in advance as accurately as possible and are purchased quarterly through the office of the State Purchasing Agent. Engineer - ing supplies and equipment also are purchased through the office of the State Purchasing Agent, as needed. Field engineering- parties are furnished equipment by this division when they leave the Lin - coln office, and upon their return the equipment is returned to this division. When such equipment is returned it is examined carefully and repairs and adjustments are made as required. The necessity of sending transits and levels to factories for repairs has been eliminated almost entirely by the installation of a well equipped repair shop in the State Capitol. All outgoing mail which originates in any office of the Depart - ment of Roads and Irrigation in the Capitol is delivered to this divi - sion where postage stamps are affixed before it is posted. The use of this method of handling all such mail results in a considerable saving in the cost of postage because, usually, all mail which is ad - dressed to the same office or any individual is assembled and for - warded in a single envelope or package each day. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF CONSTRUCTION The activities of this division include the field engineering- and inspection of all construction operations from the time contracts are awarded until the work is satisfactorily completed and turned over to the Division of Maintenance. The construction work consists of grad - ing-, drainage structures, grade separations, gravel, bituminous and concrete surfacing, and roadside improvement. The activities also in - clude the preparation of final computations and estimates and the checking of payrolls for labor requirements. All construction activities, as shown by the organization chart, are under the general supervision of the construction engineer. In the construction organization, the field inspection of the stabilized soil base course construction and bituminous surfaces are directed by the materials engineer; the roadside improvement projects are super - vised by the landscape engineer; the inspection of concrete pavement and fill compaction is directed by a special assistant to the construc - tion engineer; and the checking of labor payrolls is assigned to a sub - division in the Lincoln office. All field activities are conducted through the district engineers. The project engineers supervise and have direct charge of the construction projects. During this biennium, there were 644 contracts awarded for con - struction work up to November 1, 1938. These contracts provided for work in 75 counties during 1937, and in 68 counties during 1938. The work which was completed or placed under contract up to November 1, 1938, is as follows: Grading and structures , . .808 miles Concrete pavement 100 miles Bituminous pavement 709 miles Subways at railroad crossings 2 Viaducts at railroad crossings 3 Subways at highway or street intersections 3 Viaduct at highway intersection 1 Flashing light signals at railroad crossings 27 Traffic lights at highway or street intersections 5 The Standard Specifications for Highway Construction were re - vised during 1937 and were specified for use beginning with the let - ting of July 29, 1937. Some of the major changes in these specifica - tions provide for: (a) A pre-established schedule of unit prices for clearing and grubbing. (b) Moisture control in the compaction of fills. (c) Concrete for all structures to be consolidated by vibrating. (d) Method of measurement and basis of payment for piling. Prior to the 1937 specifications, clearing and grubbing were not paid for directly but were considered as subsidiary to any or all </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER items of excavation. The 1937 specifications provide a fixed schedule of unit prices for this class of work. The use of moisture control in the compaction of embankments Is one of the biggest changes in construction methods. In addition to rolling each 6-inch layer as previously specified, the moisture con - tent of the earth or soil in each layer must be adjusted so that it will not be more or less than the required per cent of the "optimum" moisture content for compaction. On roads which are to be surfaced Preliminary Construction for Havelock Subway with bituminous materials, the moisture content of the soil is adjusted to be within 3 per cent above or below a value which is 80 per cent of the "optimum" moisture content for compaction, and on roads which are to be surfaced with concrete, the moisture content of the soil in the embankment is adjusted to be within 4 per cent above or below a value which is 90 per cent of the "optimum" moisture content for compaction. In both of the above cases as well as in the case of shoulders adjacent to concrete pavement, the density of the embank - ment is required to be at least 90 per cent of the maximum value obtained in the compaction test. The previous method of spading concrete is replaced by the use of internal vibrators for consolidation of the concrete in all structures. The 1937 specifications provide that the footage and number of piles ordered shall be the responsibility of the contractor and that payment will only be made for the actual lineal feet from cutoff to the point where both specified penetration and bearing capacity are obtained. No payment is to be made for cutoffs, splices, or piling ordered but not used. </seg>

One of the most interesting projects during this biennium was the building of 4 miles on Highway No. 31 north of Gretna between "Q" and Dodge Streets in Douglas County. This project included two highway grade separation structures. These are the first structures to be constructed by the State outside of corporate limits separating two highways. One is a viaduct at the intersection of Highway No. 31 and Center Street, and the other a subway under the 42-foot wide, 4-lane pavement on Dodge Street. This project, including the grading and other structures, was built in conjunction with the WPA. The De - partment, with State and Federal funds, furnished the materials, equip - ment, and engineering, and the WPA furnished all labor, including skilled and supervisory help. </seg>

            <seg id="p086">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER During this biennium there were 27 automatic flashing light sig - nals installed at railroad crossings. Most of these were constructed with the use of Federal Grade Crossing funds, and were placed at crossings on improved roads where this type of protection was con - sidered satisfactory or where funds were not available to separate the grades. It is expected that these signals will aid materially in road safety and accident prevention at railroad crossings. CONCRETE PAVEMENT During the past biennium, there have been constructed approxi - mately 40 concrete pavement projects. Of this number, 25 were short projects within municipalities and 15 were on rural highway locations. Of the 25 projects constructed within municipalities, 9 were di - rectly connected with the construction of railroad grade crossing separation structures. The remainder of the municipal projects were constructed generally to provide adequate approaches from relocated or improved highways and bridges to the municipality. One of the projects was the reconstruction of a heavy-duty street, 57 feet wide, in Omaha. Two other projects, serving as short connecting links, were also constructed in Omaha. The aggregate length of the 15 rural projects was approximately 105 miles. The construction of this pavement has resulted in the elimination of the gaps in the hard surfacing on several of the major trunk highways of the State. On all rural pavement, special attention has been given to wider curves and greater sight distances to promote the utility and safety of the highway. Careful supervision and precise control of materials ai:d methods have been maintained on all concrete paving. The construction of paving projects is carried on under the direction of the construction engineer through the district and project engineers. The engineering organization in direct charge of construction in the field, consists of a project engineer, one or more instrument men, rodmen, chainmen, subgrade inspectors, gravel inspectors, plant inspector, slab inspector, and helpers. The members of each field party reside close to the project and are constantly in touch with every detail of the work. The details of supervision include the setting of line and grade stakes for the guidance of contractors, the inspection of work per - formed and materials used, the interpretation of plans and specifi - cations, measurement of quantities, of work for which payment is to be made to the contractors, the preparation of monthly pay esti - mates, and formal acceptance of the work after it is completed. When a number of projects are active at the same time, a considerable super - vising force is needed. All phases of work entering into the construction of concrete pave - ment are given rigid supervision and inspection. Cement is inspected </seg>

Check samples of the above, as well as samples of other materials including steel, wire mesh and bituminous materials are submitted to the Testing- Laboratory for physical and chemical analysis. The details of construction operations such as prep - aration of the subgrade, form setting, and the proportioning, mixing, placing, finishing and curing of the concrete are closely supervised to insure conformity with the specifications. All concrete materials for pavement, with the exception of ' water, are weighed accurately and carefully handled to prevent loss and keep them clean. Water is measured by volume. Bulk cement is used universally except in the case of short projects where the quantity required is too small to war - rant the installation of platforms and scales for handling. The time for opening pavement to traffic is based on the strength of the concrete as determined from results of beam specimens which are made from each day's run. These beam tests are made in the field by the plant inspector. Acceptance of the concrete is based on the compressive strength of cylinders made during the progress of the work. Two cylinders are made from each day's run and are sub - mitted to the Testing Laboratory at Lincoln for test. A check on the concrete pavement acceptable for payment is made by drilling cores from the pavement shortly after it is laid and determining the depth of pavement on the basis of measurements of these cores. Deductions in the payment are made when the core measurements indicate a defici - ency in the depth of the pavement. All concrete pavement constructed during the past biennium has utilized sand gravel aggregate, mainly of Flatte River origin. The failure to use standard coarse gravel or crushed : limestone for any of this construction is probably due to the high cost of production of these aggregates and the expense of shipment from the restricted sources of supply to the site of the projects. It is 'interesting to note, however, that approximately one-half of the sand gravel used has been of the divided type; that is,: the fine and coarse portions of the aggregate have been mechanically separated and are recombined at the batching plant in the proper proportions for higher density and strength. The- use of this divided type of sand gravel aggregate per - mits the use of a lower cement content without decreasing the strength and durability of the concrete. On the basis of experimental mixes and tests made at the Test - ing Laboratory and on the basis of tests made on the actual con - crete used in pavement constructed two to eight years ago, it has been found that concrete using present day materials is definitely superior in strength to the concrete made only a few years ago. This is due primarily to the manufacture of cements of higher quality and to the improved methods in the production of aggregates. As a result of the higher strengths obtained by present day concrete, the sped- </seg>
            <seg id="p089">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION fications have been revised during the past biennium to permit a lower ratio of cement while still maintaining the strength require - ments necessary for proper design of the pavement. Except for a few special cases where it has been necessary to fit local conditions, the design of concrete pavement has been well stabilized. The standard 2-lane pavement has a 20-foot width, an edge thickness of 9 inches, and a center thickness of 7 inches. Wire-mesh or bar-mat reinforcement are used with both the combined and divided sand-gravel aggregates, but would not be used with standard coarse and fine aggregates. The use of reinforcement in sand-gravel concretes Pavement West of Sewnrd Before Center Stripe Was Painted is based on the fact that special surveys of cracks in concrete pave - ments have indicated that concrete made from sand-gravel aggregate has shown considerably more cracking than concrete made from the standard coarse and fine aggregate, and that the use of wire mesh or bar mats as reinforcement will reduce the amount of cracking and thereby reduce the cost of maintenance and increase the life of the pavement. Expansion joints, consisting in most cases of a 1-inch pre - formed material, are placed at 90-foot intervals. Wherever wire-mesh reinforcement is used throughout the slab, one contraction joint or plane of weakness is placed between each pair of expansion joints, making the contraction joint interval 45 feet. Where wire mesh is not used, these joints are placed at 30-foot intervals. The transfer of wheel loads across a joint in the pavement is accomplished by the use of %-inch by 2-foot steel dowels spaced at 15-inch intervals across </seg>
            <seg id="p090">REPORT OF THIS STATE ENGINEER the joint. The present design requires that a dowel-bar assembly shall be used. This assembly holds the dowel bars in position and insures the proper location and position of the dowel bars so that loads may be transferred more effectively across the joints. On one rural project, which also included two highway grade cross - ing separation structures and semi-clover leaf approaches, the stan - dard design was modified to provide for pavement of 22-foot width. It is interesting to note the changes in widths of concrete pave - ment which have been made as a result of the demands of the heavy volume of high speed traffic found on our highways today. The gen - eral standard design for some of the early rural concrete pavement built in the State called for an 18-foot width, and this design had been preceded by considerable mileages of 16-foot pavement in some other States. With the advent of a greater volume of traffic and higher speeds and the very large increase in trucking operations, the standard design was increased to provide for concrete pavement of 20-foot width. As noted in the proceeding paragraph, a 20-foot width is the present standard of design and a very large percentage of the concrete pave - ment in this State, as well as throughout the country, is built to this standard. The general specifications provide that the concrete pavement shall be cured by one of three general methods. These are: curing with wet burlap for 72 hours; curing by ponding for 72 hours; or curing with wet earth for 7 days. The method most generally used is the ponding method which involves building dikes on the edges of the pavement and allowing water to stand on the pavement for the re - quired period. However, on several projects constructed in 1938, the use of an impervious coating on the concrete was permitted as a curing method. In this method, as soon as the water sheen on the concrete has disappeared (generally one to two hours after the place - ment of the concrete), a water-impermeable lacquer-like substance is applied directly to the surface of the concrete with an air spray. By use of the air spray, the material may be applied to the desired thickness and forms a continuous film which prevents the loss of the water in the concrete during the curing period. The advantages of this type of curing are that the pavement is not covered with dirt and mud that would have to be removed, the shoulders adjacent to the pavement are not flooded with water, and after the curing ma - terial is applied, no further operation is required for the opening of the pavement for use. Perhaps the most difficult problem remaining in the construc - tion of an ideal concrete pavement is the elimination of the pave - ment distortion which occurs as a result of swelling of subgrade soil when that soil is wetted by infiltration of water at the pave - ment joints and edges. During the past biennium a special effort has been made to treat the subgrade soils in such a manner as to </seg>
            <seg id="p091">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION minimize their tendency to swell when wetted. A large number of the projects were constructed with . definite control of the moisture and density of the existing subgrade soil for a depth of 6 inches below the bottom of the pavement. The specification for this type of subgrade treatment required that the moisture content be within 3 per cent of the optimum moisture for compaction and that the density be at least 90 per cent of the density attained in a standard compaction test. Another type of subgrade treatment, used exten - sively in 1938 was the addition of mineral aggregates to the existing subgrade material, and the mixture and compaction of the soil and aggregate subgrade for the pavement. One of the results of using subgrade treatments has been the elimination of subgrade paper which has long been a factor in concrete pavement construction. An additional measure to minimize subgrade swelling when wetted has been the sealing of joints to reduce the extent of the infiltration of water through the joints. On practically all the concrete pavement constructed during the biennium, it has been required that an asphal - tic sealing material be poured into the pavement joints within twenty - four hours after the laying of the pavement. A further improvement in joint design has been the specifying of a non-extrusive material for joints so as to eliminate the undesirable little humps which occur at pavement joints in hot weather when the concrete expands and forces out the joint material which has been used in past years. During the past two years there have been several changes in the types of equipment and methods of operation in connection with actual construction of concrete pavements. Some of these changes "are due directly to a change in the specifications for the work. An example of this is the necessity of providing an internal type vibrator with a paving outfit since the specifications require that the joints and edges of concrete pavement be vibrated. Other changes are due primarily to the contractor's choice of operations. The mechanical subgrader, which planes the subgrade and conveys the excess ma - terial outside the forms, has come into general use during the bien - nium. Other equipment making its initial appearance was a large dual drum mixer, which averaged more than 180 feet of standard pave - ment per hour on several occasions. BITUMINOUS PAVEMENTS The past two years have seen continued progress in the develop - ment of the low-cost pavements. Bituminous mats, bituminous sand surfaces, and stabilized soil base courses with armor coat treatments have been designed and constructed with increasing proficiency. The stabilized soil base course with armor coat treatment is the latest development of low-cost pavements. This type of surfacing is satis- </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER factorily meeting the demands of traffic, and the initial cost of con - struction is comparatively low. Greater use of local materials can be made in this type of construction than in any other type of pavement. This results in economy in the construction cost. The first stabilized soil base course with armor coat treatment was constructed in 1936 on Highway No. 15, north of Seward. The satisfactory performance of this road has led to its extensive use elsewhere. There were 148 miles of this pavement constructed in this State in 1937 and 170 miles in 1938. Oil Distributor on Bituminous Construction The stabilized soil base course used thus far in Nebraska is termed the "mechanically stabilized" type. It consists of a combination of natural soil and graded aggregates properly proportioned to provide a stable mixture of clay, silt, sand, and gravel. These materials are mixed and then wetted, laid, and compacted on a previously pre - pared subgrade. The success of this type of construction depends primarily upon the characteristics of material used in the mixture, the control of the proportions, and the degree to which they are compacted. In order to insure the most satisfactory construction, using available local materials, it is necessary to make a prelimin - ary inventory of the soil material resources on each proposed con - struction project. This preliminary inventory consists of locating and investigating possible sources of rock, gravel, sand, and soil binder. Samples are taken of the material selected and sent to the labora - tories where tests reveal the road-building properties of each. A study is also made of the soils in the subgrade on each project. Borings are made with a soil auger at frequent intervals, and each </seg>

Judging from the number of requests for participation received from all parts of the State, this type of highway work is becoming in - creasingly popular with the general public. There is little doubt as to the influence it has had upon the growing activities of the American Legion in Arbor Day planting and the extension of street planting by municipalities onto the'highways of their respective vicinities. It is to be regretted, however, that all requests could not be sat - isfied. All contemplated locations do not lend themselves to treat - ment under standards required in order to obtain Federal approval and aid.

(b) Existence of utility pole lines either on one or both sides of the highway prohibiting the planting of trees. (c) A lack of flat or drained areas for planting. Under the requirement of the United States Bureau of Public Roads that at least one per cent of all regular Federal Funds must be spent for Roadside Improvement, the following amounts have been expended, encumbered or have become available during the present biennium: 1936 Works Progress Administration, expended $38,707.39 1936 Combined Federal and State Aid, expended and encumbered 51,633.26 1937 Combined Federal and State Aid, expended and ap - portioned 51,725.34 1938 Combined Federal and State Aid, apportioned 52,848.46 1939 Combined Federal and State Aid, available 51,700.00 Due to excessive dryness and extreme low temperatures of the winter of 1936-37 and the severe test undergone by plant material put out in the fall of 1936, it was decided that all planting in the future would be done in the spring of the year, except miscellaneous con - struction work and seeding of right of way which is best accomplished about September first. The majority of projects executed during this biennium have con - sisted only in planting trees and shrubs. Other types of work have covered soil erosion work, slope rounding and seeding. Ten projects were constructed in the spring of 1937. One of these consisted of providing a winding concrete foot path through a com - pleted planting on the western edge of Lincoln. To be in keeping with the semi-urban atmosphere of the project, sidewalk- was made by lay - ing irregular precast blocks, creating the effect of stone flagging. Two projects, one upon State property of the Game and Parks Commission on the Blue River south of Milford, and the other at a triangle intersection south of Winslow, were improved to furnish road - side turnouts for the driving public. The Milford improvement opened up, through the construction of curbed driveways, ovens, and picnic tables, an undeveloped river setting to create one of the most beauti - ful and impressive spots in our State system. The remaining seven projects comprised typical highway plant - ing in group design. During the spring of 1938, fifteen projects were completed and two additional projects were begun, the planting of the latter being postponed until the spring of 1939.

Serious ditch erosion was forestalled by the construction of stone ditch checks and retain - ing walls. Three projects featured roadside parks and parking, one at Ver - don on property of the State Game and Parks Commission, another upon the segregated area adjoining the Waterloo Viaduct, and the third adjacent to the Hastings Viaduct. The remaining projects in this spring's work were typical highway plantings. One of the uncompleted projects is an innovation in Nebraska's program.

The thoroughfare through the city is bordered by eleven service stations and four lunch stands, all having unlimited and unrestricted approach from the highway. Along with typical highway improvement, the dual problem is being solved by the construction of two approach drives separated by intervening planted traffic islands for each business enterprise. The project when com - pleted should create a broad and impressive thoroughfare bringing wide-spread benefits to the municipality. During the period of four years that the Department has been engaged in this type of work, it has set out approximately 22,000 trees and 91,000 shrubs over an accumulated distance of 210 miles, enough to reach from Lincoln nearly to North Platte or to Des Moines, Iowa. Based upon previous experience, choice of plant species underwent a considerable change during this biennium. Among trees, the hack - berry demonstrated the greatest survival of the drought period with </seg>

The Chinese elm will always be a valuable thicket tree but its longevity is still uncertain. Little can be added to the desirability of ever - greens, which have proved their worth in the past and still rank pre - eminent in survival and freedom from the ills of our broadleaf species. The choice of shrubs has narrowed down to native and semi - domestic types. The wild plum, choke-cherry, wild black cherry, coral - berry and sumac have been outstanding in survival. The Russian olive and mulberry deserve mention. While the use of ground cover has been limited, the results ob - tained seem to point to Halls honeysuckle, wichuriana rose and matri - mony vine as being most satisfactory. In addition to the use of the above ground cover as a soil ero - sion preventative this period also included the seeding of 230 acres of * " 1 Bank Cover of 3-year Old Hall's Honeysuckle as an Erosion Preventative on Highway No. 30 Alternate right of way with .brome or western wheat grasses or sweet clover. As grasses develop mainly during the second year of growth, it Is difficult to determine the benefits derived at this time.

Understanding was reached with the utility companies whereby all growth interfering with overhead wires will be corrected only upon permission and such cutting as is done shall be under regulations guaranteed to maintain the natural beauty of the countryside.

Bureau of Public Roads with those of its own, so that all contracted work is performed in accordance with these definite provisions governing the classification of laborers, hours worked, and wages paid. In order to ascertain that certain labor provisions are fulfilled, the weekly certified transcript of labor pay rolls required from the contractors are checked and audited in the Lincoln office.

The original and first copy of Federal Aid pay rolls and original of State construc - tion, or maintenance pay rolls are forwarded to this office. The dis - trict engineer's office and the project engineer each receive one of the remaining two copies. The weekly certified transcript of labor pay roll is submitted for each individual project and must show all the men employed on that project by the contractor. The pay roll must show the class of labor - administrative, skilled, intermediate, or unskilled. Each man's name, address, hours worked per day, total hours for the week, wages paid per hour, and the total amount earned for the week must be shown under the proper iabor classification. The contractor is required to secure all unskilled labor from the Nebraska State Employment Service which is affiliated with the U. S. Employment Service. He may also avail himself of the services of the Employment Service for obtaining labor for the three other, classes. . : The administrative labor is unlimited as to the hours worked, while skilled, intermediate, and unskilled labor are limited to forty hours per week. Working time lost due to inclement weather or shut - down during the period of employment may be made up in the suc - ceeding three weeks. The contractor may secure a waiver of hours limitation upon for - warding a statement from the Employment Service stating the latter's inability to refer the necessary labor. This is accompanied by a sworn statement from the contractor as to his own inability to secure the particular type of labor. Upon the approval of the request by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads and this office, the contractor may work the types of labor listed not more than ten hours per day or 270 hours per month. The transcripts are checked to see that all the above-mentioned requirements are fulfilled. If these requirements are not fulfilled, the contractor must submit a correction or reasonable explanation before the pay roll and future pay rolls can be cleared. In addition to this, the pay roll must show a total for each class of labor and a grand total for the week. These totals indicate the number of men secured by the contractor from the Employment Service, those directly employed by the contractor, and the hours worked and wages paid in all classes of labor. The previous totals and totals to date for the project are shown on each pay roll so as to reflect clearly the total labor to date, hours worked, and wages paid for each class of labor. After the Federal-aid and State-construction or maintenance pay rolls are audited and summary sheets prepared, the original copy of the Federal-aid pay roll is forwarded to the U. S. Bureau of Public" Roads and the copy filed in a. separate project folder in this office. The original copy of the State-construction or maintenance pay roll </seg>
            <seg id="p100">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Is filed in specially prepared books. The summary sheets for both Federal-aid and State-construction or maintenance pay rolls are filed with other summary sheets from which statistical data may be taken. An added duty of this office is to prepare Federal-aid direct-labor pay rolls. These pay rolls are prepared from the extra labor reports which are submitted by the project engineer. After the direct labor transcripts are prepared, they are handled in the same manner as the other Federal-aid pay rolls. Upon the completion of any contracted work, a complete audit of the pay roll is made. A check is made on the actual construction beginning and completion date of the work. If the pay rolls on file cover these dates, the office awaits the final estimate. All final esti - mates must have the labor approval of this office before being paid. Prior to August 1, 1936, 6,223 pay rolls were submitted to the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads. By August of 1937 the number was 9,343 and to date, August 1, 1938, the total number has reached 12, - 592. It will be noted that in the period from August 1, 1937 to August 1, 1938 there was an increase of 249 pay rolls over the previ - ous year. Had the number of pay rolls submitted during this period included State construction and maintenance pay rolls as it did previ - ous to March 1, 1937, it would be found that a much greater increase would be shown. The labor furnished by contractors in the performance of con - tracts with the Department of Roads and Irrigation for the year of 1937 was 2,363,680 hours worked and $1,151,225.70 paid in wages. This employment was distributed as follows: Men Hours Wages Low week— February 6 116 3,347 $ 2,049.26 High week— August 14 3,270 107,958 51,246.12 Average week 1,445 45,455 22,138.96 The figures for 1938 will be larger than those of 1937 due to an Increase in contracted work. </seg>
            <seg id="p101">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATION The purpose of the Division of Maintenance is to keep the high - ways in good condition and to make all necessary repairs in order to provide the users with a safe, comfortable and convenient means for travel and to protect the original investment or construction cost, so that the most is received from it. All maintenance operations are handled by the State Engineer through the Maintenance Engineer, who has general supervision over all maintenance activities in the State. The State is divided into eight districts, comprised of about eleven or twelve counties each, and each under a District Engineer, who is responsible to the Maintenance En - gineer for the maintenance activities in his district. Each of the eight districts is subdivided into maintenance divisions with a chief patrol - man, or resident engineer, in charge. There are about five mainten - ance divisions to each district, the size of each depending upon the type of highway, the amount of traffic, the topography and climatic condi - tions. Then, finally, that portion of the highway system which is eli - gible for maintenance is divided into patrol sections of varied lengths. A patrolman with proper equipment is assigned to each patrol. Another important part of the organization is the mechanical division which keeps the equipment in condition, so that the road maintenance force can carry on their work without undue delay. This division is in charge of a chief mechanic, working directly under the Maintenance Engineer, who has general supervision of all mechanical work. In each of the eight districts there is a district mechanic who works under the District Engineer, and each district is divided into three to four mechanical divisions, each with an assistant mechanic. The assistant mechanics have definite equipment assigned to their care and are held responsible for keeping those pieces in proper repair. A main repair shop is located at Lincoln, where complete motor over - hauling jobs and other heavy work is done for all districts. The work done at Lincoln is of such nature that it would not pay to equip each district repair shop to perform this work. The clerical and statistical work of the organization is centralized as much as possible in the Lincoln office. Each of the eight districts has a district clerk who prepares and forwards payrolls for labor and vouchers for materials which must be purchased in the field, to the Lincoln office where they are checked, recorded and forwarded for pay - ment. The Lincoln office keeps records, in itemized form, of the costs of each patrol and each piece of equipment. The information necessary to accomplish this is taken from the daily reports made by each em - ployee as to the type of work done and information regarding equip - ment operation. It requires approximately 450 regular employes to operate the maintenance organization. More than two-thirds of this number are </seg>

Moisture is an absolute necessity to the economical maintenance of a smooth gravel road. Dust holes develop, particularly in clay-surfaced roads, making it necessary to haul in new material and large quantities of water to get it properly compacted. Much of the material and water must be hauled long dis - tances which obviously makes this type of maintenance an expensive operation. With adequate moisture it is not only cheaper, but also requires less work to provide a satisfactory road surface. It was im - possible to keep as good road surface as desired even though greater expenditures were made for this purpose than would have been required under normal weather conditions. Tables 14 and 15 and figures 3 and 4 show the comparison of precipitation during the past two years with the normal annual precipitation in Nebraska.

SNOW REMOVAL The prevention of snow drifts and removal of snow is one of the most important activities of the maintenance organization. Since travel by motor vehicle and transportation of commodities over the highways is rapidly increasing, the demand for good highways the year around has likewise increased. It is, therefore, obvious that every possible precaution must be taken to keep the highways constantly open and clear of snow drifts as well as to keep the surfaces free of snow and ice, even though they are not blocked by drifts. Therefore, since there is no way to predetermine whether there will be heavy snow storms or not, it is necessary each year to erect several hundred miles of snow fence in order to insure, insofar as practical, the elimination of drifts at those points on the highways most subject to drifting. Last year 4,221,954 linear feet or approximately 800 miles of snow fence were hauled out, erected, and later taken down and hauled in. To do this required the driving and later the pulling of approximately 297,500 steel snow-fence posts. It is also necessary to maintain, in good order, trucks and tractors with snow plows attached in readiness to cope with the snow problem if it arises. It is the policy to purchase each year, sufficient new snow fence, to protect new roads which have not been previously on the system and replace to some extent old fence which has deteriorated beyond further use. While it is impossible to provide enough, snow fighting equipment to handle, as rapidly as desired, unusual snow conditions, a few units are obtained each year so that facilities available for snow removal are gradually improved. Due to the fact that the amount of snow received varies considerably from year to year and the condition </seg>

The most severe snow storm during this biennium occurred between January 1, and January 18, 1937. Snow began falling the evening of January 1, over the northeastern part of the State. The area covered extended from the Platte River north to the State line and from Ainsworth east to the Missouri River. By the following morning the 1200 miles of State highways in that area were badly drifted with snow so that traffic was virtually at a standstill. While all the State's snow-removal equipment in that section was at work the following day, very little was accomplished due to continued snow and a high wind, m£ ' S'**r " - MTi^B "' : . •?■'•/"■ ""v .-;"'■■&gt;''."

Later in the day the storm abated, giving the men and equipment an opportunity to work effectively so that all highways were made passable in a few days. But all was in vain. Additional snow, accompanied by the usual blasts of winds, caused the same highways to become reblocked to a greater extent than previously, on January 7. The Department rushed in snow removal equipment from other sections of the State and began breaking through huge drifts from 4 to 15 feet in depth. All equipment was operated day and night, supplemented with crews of shovelers. Many men worked long hours in bitterly cold weather because relief crews were unable to get to them. For the first time in the history of the Department, rotary snow plows were put into service, this being the only type of equipment that could successfully penetrate the huge drifts. The work was slowed down materially due to the icy and packed condition of the snow. The </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER snow plows would ride over the drifts to the extent that as much as 12 inches of snow would remain in the path opened. This snow would soon become churned up by traffic so that the road would become almost impassable until shovelers or another plow came along and cleaned it to the surface. Again the objective was almost in sight, with traffic moving along in a fairly normal manner, when on Thursday night, January 14, the velocity of the wind increased to such an extent that the snow was blown back onto the roadway. On Friday morning drifted highways again halted all traffic over the same area and the Department began all over again to do what it had twice before undertaken within a period of ten days. Again on January 18, all highways were open and passable, with the big job of widening and removing the snow from the surface well under way. The Department received many distress calls for help from inland towns during the early period of the storms, which were given imme - diate attention. However, the necessity of this prevented, to some extent, the proper correlation of the work, and as a result more heavily traveled routes were, in many cases, not opened as soon as expected. The problem of getting food and fuel to towns during the latter period of the storm became acute, not only for inland towns, but also for those located on railroads. And in several instances, distress calls were answered and highways opened before railroad companies were able to open their lines. Some idea of the magnitude of the problem can be obtained by the following snow removal costs: for the winter 1933-34, snow removal cost was $12,699.48; for the winter 1934-35, $57,560.00; for the winter 1935-36, $269,634.75; for the winter 1936-37, $184,087.29; and for the past winter the costs were $48,470.00. While the service rendered during this period may not have been as good as expected, the condition was not a normal one and it is impossible to have enough equipment to cope with such a condition. To own the amount of equipment necessary would mean a tremendous investment for which there would be use only at intervals of several years. MAINTENANCE BUILDINGS With the assistance of W.P.A., considerable progress has been made in the improvement of shop and storage facilities at various locations throughout the State. Outstanding of these was the con - struction of district shop and storage buildings on a 3-acre tract at McCook, headquarters of District Six. Both buildings are substantially fireproof, being constructed of steel, concrete, and galvanized metal. The structures for the most part are made of cement blocks manufac - tured locally as part of the project. </seg>

Present plans contemplate a continuation of this program, giving first consideration to those locations where desirable facilities are not available or where rentals are unusually high. It is felt that Department-owned buildings and yards are highly important to properly protect material carried in stock and to properly maintain the equip - ment and protect the large investment made necessary for needed material and equipment. Buildings with storage yards have been made available during this biennium at the following locations: McCook, Kearney, Elm Creek, Springview, Wayne, Laurel, Fullerton, Central City, Ord, St. Paul, Red Cloud, Superior, Cairo, Tecumsen, and Wakefield. In addition to the above completely new storage and shop facilities, extensions and improvements have been made at the Department's central plant at Lincoln and those at district headquarters in Bridge - port, Grand Island, Ainsworth, and Norfolk. Due to the increase of bituminous mat highway mileage it has become necessary to install asphalt storage tanks at strategical points. The tanks have a storage capacity of 12,000 gallons. Additional equip - ment necessary for operation of such a plant consists of gas engine or electric motor operated pump and steam boiler for heating the material. During this biennium plants have been built at Bridgeport, Columbus, Wayne, and McCook. SIGNS The maintenance of signs as a "daily duty" of patrolmen has been continued as in the past in order that all signs may be properly and carefully placed and in good order at all times to direct the traveling public to its destination without inconvenience, and for their protection, to warn them of all known hazards. The theory is, that if the highway is carefully marked and if the highway user observes the directions and warnings, given by the signs, there can be no danger from the known hazards ahead. On November 7, 1935, the American Standards Association ap - proved, as an American standard, a uniform plan of traffic control devices and markings for use on streets and highways in the United States. This plan has been approved by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads and is in accord with recommendations of national organizations interested in the subject. The American Association of State Highway Officials and the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety are two of the cooperative organizations who took a leading part in developing this plan. While the system used in the State of Nebraska compares very closely to the uniform plan, it is the intention to change over to the uniform system in every detail as rapidly as_ economic procedure will permit. </seg>

            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER All new signs purchased since January 1, 1936, have been designed to conform with the standard and will replace all old signs as soon as they have deteriorated and become unfit for refinishing and further use. Standard type signs have been placed on approximately twenty - five hundred miles of highway to date, and in order to promote safety, all such warning signs have been reflectorized, making them easily read at night. Recommendations as to what part of the sign should be reflector - ized varies with respect to the intention. For example, on curve and turn signs the symbol is reflectorized; on stop signs and the "RR" in railroad crossing signs, the word or letters are reflectorized; and on other slow type warning signs, the outline is reflectorized. While signs with reflectorized outlines may not appear adequate, it is felt the general use of such illumination will tend to make the motorists conscious of the meaning of the shapes and instinctively obedient to them. As an additional safety measure the Department has placed nine hundred, 9-button red reflector signs at the ends of narrow bridges or other structures and at points where the highway ends or makes a sharp turn. Due to the frequent occurrences of accidents on hills and curves, five hundred special signs have been placed at advantageous points with the notation "Do Not Pass on Hills and Curves". This, it is felt, will call to the motorist's attention the danger involved when attempting to overtake another vehicle under these conditions, and will help materially in eliminating accidents of this nature. The Statutes of this State provide that the Department purchase all new standard metal signs from the State Board of Control which has supervision over all State Institutions. All such signs are manu - factured at the State Reformatory for Men, near Lincoln. All other signs, both metal and wood, are made at the Department's sign shop located in the State Equipment shop in Lincoln. This same shop also refinishes all signs which are fit for reuse except for the condition of finish. During this biennium 76,284 signs were refinished and 12,002 new signs were made, consisting of both metal and wood, varying in size from 18"xl8" to 4'x6\ Special signs have been designed, constructed, and placed at the junctions of all highways, indicating to traffic the distance to the next town and other larger towns on the various routes intersecting at the junction. This sign replaces the high arrow and post type, and is de - signed and placed so as to be readable from the driver's seat, either by day or night, when approaching a junction. The signs are well constructed of California redwood and are made at the Department's sign shop at Lincoln at a minimum cost. Careful logging of the highways was necessary in order to provide correct driving distances. The single arrow type signs previously used at highway junctions were removed and are being remodeled for use at the intersection of </seg>
            <seg id="p117">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION main local routes leading to towns or points of interest which may not be located on State highways. .The arrows indicate the distance to and the name of the town, or give information with respect to the identity of the place in case a town is not nearby. The daily occurrence and constant increase in the number of traf - fic accidents makes it apparent that the problem of proper highway signing is of paramount importance, requiring diligent study and ex - perimentation. Therefore, the Department has consistantly endeavored to improve this function as rapidly as possible, giving consideration, of course, to funds available for this purpose. Signs have been designed, constructed, and erected at State lines where highways cross from Nebraska into another State. The signs indicate to traffic that they are entering another State and the signs indicating entrance into Nebraska also inform traffic of the 50-mile - per-hour speed limit. Painting Center Stripe on Bituminous Pavement The introduction of bituminous mat construction has created the problem of providing a centerline mark on a black soft asphaltic sur - face. After considerable experimenting, a white paint has been de - veloped which can be satisfactorily used on this type of surface. The work of placing it on all bituminous mat highways is well under way at this time and should be completed before the end of this year. ROAD MAGNETS There is no doubt that the use of road magnets operated over other than hard-surfaced highways in order to pick up metallic sub - stances which would puncture a tire, has a material effect in prevent - ing accidents. Therefore, two of these units have been used during the past two years and we have been able to cover the entire system at least once during their effective season. The two machines were made in our Lincoln shop and consist of a motor and generator mounted on </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER a two-ton truck. The generator produces the electricity for magnetiz - ing the magnet suspended from the center of the truck chassis The trucks are equipped with sleeping quarters for the operator who leaves the Lincoln headquarters early In the spring. He follows a designated route and rarely returns until fall. The equipment cannot be operated effectively in the winter when the ground is frozen. During the year of 1937 the machines covered a total of 4 054 miles, picking up 25,264 pounds or 12.63 tons of metal, an average of 623 pounds per mile. The heaviest pickup was made on Highway No 183 between Valentine and the State line where 235 pounds were picked up in a distance of 9 miles or an average of 26.11 pounds per mile Up to September 1, 1938 the two road magnets had covered a total of 2,985 miles with a total pickup of 17,108 pounds or an average pickup of 5.73 pounds per mile. The heaviest pickup occurred between Wellfleet and Wallace on Highway No. 23 where 1,205 pounds of metal were picked up in a distance of 29 miles or an average pickup of 41 5 pounds per mile. SEEDING SHOULDERS on £? * eb *f ka « effort «» ™d e to obtain a growth of vegetation on ail shoulders. Considerable seeding of shoulders on hard-surfaced highways is undertaken each year. However, due to recent years of drought, little progress has been made in developing sodded shoulders in this manner. Where seeding or sodding is not undertaken success - fully, native vegetation is permitted to grow. Seeding is done both in early spring and early fall and in some cases the entire right of way out to the top of the back slopes is seeded. Brome grass generally is planted at the rate of 20 pounds per acre with a nurse crop of oats Good results have been obtained In a number of cases It is felt that Brome grass provides an excellent sod and has ample root growth to materially assist in preventing erosion. During the biennium, approximately 100,000 pounds of Brome erass seed was harvested from selected areas on the right of way where good stands prevailed. The seed is used the following fall or spring for new or reseeding.

The number of items of stock of material and supplies carried in the main supply base at Lincoln was materially increased where this was found to be advantageous. Generally, stocks sufficient only for sixty to ninety days are carried on articles in current use but in some cases, due to rising prices, it has been advantageous to increase the stock sufficiently to provide for a year. Because of conditions imposed by the Code of the Petroleum In - dustry whereby deliveries of gasoline may not be made directly to the equipment or to cans, it has been necessary to install a gasoline distri - bution system. A complete system of tanks and transports for distribu - tion is now in use. The State saved approximately $80,000.00 in 1937, by purchasing gasoline in tank car lots and distributing it to its own tanks. </seg>
            <seg id="p123">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF TESTS ORGANIZATION The official State Highway Testing Laboratory is maintained at the University of Nebraska through a cooperative arrangement be - tween the Department of Roads and Irrigation and the University, and functions as a subdivision of the Department of Engineering Me - chanics of the College of Engineering. Professor C. M. Duff, who has been designated by the Department of Roads and Irrigation as its Testing Engineer is in charge of the Division of Tests. He also devotes part of his time to teaching in the Department of Engineering Mechanics during the school year. Under the direction of Professor Duff there are three Assistant Testing Engineers who have been assigned different groups of ma - terials and it is their responsibility to pass upon the compliance of these materials with the requirements of the specifications on the basis of the test results obtained in the laboratory. A fourth Assistant Test - ing Engineer is in charge of the laboratory work and supervises the making of tests and directs the work of the laboratory assistants and also writes reports for some of the tests made on special products. Another assistant to the Testing Engineer supervises the stenographic office where the previously compiled reports and letters of the Divi - sion of Tests are typed and mailed. From thirty to forty additional laboratory and office assistants are employed. During the school year more than half of the employees of the Highway Testing Laboratory carry some University work, most of them being undergraduate students who work from fifty to one hundred hours per month and carry from a half to a normal Uni - versity schedule. This arrangement has proven very satisfactory since the test - ing work is usually lighter during the school year than during the construction season and it is also possible to arrange the work of the part-time assistants so that the laboratory equipment required for regular class experiments can be used to better advantage for student instruction and still be available for the testing of highway materials. This arrangement also gives a number of students an opportunity to partially finance their University education and in many cases it enables deserving students to acquire an education that they would not otherwise be able to obtain. It also serves as a training school for engineers whose services upon graduation or during summer va - cations, due to their fundamental knowledge of materials and testing, are more in demand in the construction and administrative work of the Department of Roads and Irrigation. Under the cooperative arrangement the University provides all the necessary laboratory and office facilities, purchases all office and </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER laboratory equipment and all laboratory supplies required for testing materials at the Highway Testing Laboratory, and pays all salaries and wages of the personnel employed in making laboratory tests and investigations and in making field inspections of various materials and constructions. The Department of Roads and Irrigation furnishes all office supplies used in connection with the writing and sending out of reports. Payment is made to the University for this service by the De - partment of Roads and Irrigation in accordance with a fixed price schedule for the various tests made and on a per diem basis for field inspections and other testing and inspecting services not covered by the price schedule. Employees of the Highway Testing Laboratory who make field inspections of material and construction are allowed traveling expenses the same as other employees of the Department of Roads and Irrigation, and payment for such expenses is made, direct to the individual making the inspection. Most of the materials used in construction and maintenance work are tested at the University laboratory. However, it has been found desirable to test some materials at their source prior to shipment. The Highway Testing Laboratory maintains an inspector at both of the Nebraska cement mills throughout the year. These inspectors test each car of cement supplied for use on highway work. Arrange - ments have been made with other testing agencies for the inspection and testing of cement supplied from out-of-state cement plants. Dur - ing the construction season from five to seven asphaltic oil inspectors are placed at the different refineries that are supplying asphaltic products for use in highway construction. The reason for testing at the point of origin, rather than taking samples at the destination and submitting them to the University laboratory for test, is to permit the use of materials immediately upon delivery to the project. Test - ing and approving material prior to shipment also prevents unneces - sary expenditures for transportation on unacceptable material. Sev - eral other products such as culvert metal, reinforcing steel, paint, creosote, and asphalt are usually sampled and tested prior to shipment. For some types of construction it has been found necessary to provide temporary field laboratories on the project where testing can be done for control purposes. Usually the field laboratories are under the supervision of a district engineer or the project engineer in charge of' the project for which the laboratory has been established. Field tests made at these laboratories are not reported through the Division of Tests and are not included in the summary of tests given in this report. Field laboratories are maintained on most of the concrete pave - ment, bituminous mat, stabilized base course, and grading projects. Methods for making the necessary control tests have been devised so that the equipment required is not elaborate and is easily portable. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION In addition to the temporary laboratories located on projects, more permanent field laboratories are maintained at several of the larger commercial gravel pits. In some cases an inspector^ is located at- a central point and supervises the testing of gravel from several pits. At other gravel pits where the gravel shipments are Intermittent or where a local gravel pit is supplying a given project or patrol, a tem - porary laboratory, equipped with a portable mechanical shaker, is often provided during the period of construction. A close control of the work done by the field laboratories is made possible by the peri - odic submission of samples to the Highway Testing Laboratory at the University for check tests or for a more complete analysis. The inspection of piling and bridge timber is usually made by a commercial testing laboratory 'which maintains inspectors at or near the source of production. Their reports are referred to the Division of Tests for review, but are not included in the summary of tests given in this report. The fabrication inspection of steel bridges is usually made prior to shipment at the fabrication shop by an assistant of the Bridge Engineer. FUNCTIONS The primary purpose of the Division of Tests is to determine by means of physical and chemical tests the acceptability or the suit - ability of materials submitted for use in highway construction and maintenance work. Usually the acceptability of a material depends entirely upon its compliance with the requirements of the specifica - tions covering its use. As far as possible all physical tests and chemi - cal analysis of materials are made in accordance with the methods adopted by the American Association of State Highway Officials or by the American Society for Testing Materials. In some instances where no standard methods of test have been adopted by these or - ganizations, it is necessary to utilize methods set up by other organ - izations or to improvise special tests in order to determine the suit - ability and acceptability of certain materials. Where no requirements are specified, materials are subjected to tests which will be indica - tive of their performance in service. From such tests the suitability of a material for a given purpose can often be determined. Many products used by the Maintenance Department are bought on the basis of both price and quality and through testing, it is pos - sible to determine which product is the most economical to buy. Often a product is found which is only slightly higher in price that is much more economical from the standpoint of the service it will give. Several products such as safety glass and truck flares now re - quire testing for compliance with Nebraska State laws before they are approved for use or sale in this State. During the past year a new service has been instituted for the Maintenance Department in connection with the testing of lubricating oil at the blending plant. </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Inspectors check all containers for cleanliness and supervise the fill - ing: of the containers to a specified quantity after which they are sealed and the S.A.E. grade and a lot number are stenciled on the container for identification purposes. Other activities include the designing of new mixtures for con - crete, bituminous surfacing, and stabilized base course; the supervising of experimental projects; the writing and improving of specifications for materials and supplies; and the development of new tests to evalu - ate certain characteristics of a material. During the past year an aeration test has been developed which gives the percentage of dilu - ent remaining in a bituminous mixture. The test is relatively simple and is adapted to field use, the only equipment required being a still, a condenser, and a crank case dilution trap. By making use of this test in the field the project engineer is able to determine whether a bituminous mixture has been sufficiently aerated so that it can be laid down without danger of subsequent rutting or shoving. The Highway Testing Laboratory also acts as a standardization laboratory for the various field laboratory inspectors. The field in - spectors periodically take duplicate samples of the materials they are testing and send one sample to the Highway Testing Laboratory for analysis. As soon as they receive a report from the laboratory the results are compared with those obtained in the field and if the comparison is not satisfactory an attempt is made to determine the cause of any discrepancies found. In this manner erroneous results due to improper procedure or faulty equipment can be detected and corrected. Standard samples of soil are made up in the laboratory and the soil constants carefully determined after which portions of the sample are sent out with the values obtained in the laboratory to the various inspectors testing soil. By testing this sample under field conditions it is possible for the inspector to standardize his procedure and equipment so that his results will be comparable to those ob - tained in any of the other field laboratories. SUMMARY OF TESTS The number of samples tested in the Highway Testing Laboratory during the past two years is about one-third less than it was during the year 1934 which was the peak year, and is about 18 per cent less than it was during the 1935-36 biennium. This decrease in the num - ber of tests made in the laboratory is due largely to the increased amount of testing done in the field. A monthly summary of laboratory tests made during the past fifteen years is shown in tabular form in Table No. 19 and graphic - ally in Figure No. 9. The graph very clearly shows the effect of seasonable variation on the number of tests made and emphasizes the necessity of having a laboratory force of varying size to effici - ently perform the number of tests shown by the peaks of the curve </seg>

Table No. 20 is a summary of the different ma - terials tested and the number of tests made for each material. Fig - ure No. 10 shows graphically the total number of tests made each biennium for the past sixteen years. NEEDS AND ACTIVITIES Although the Highway Testing Laboratory was remodeled and now occupies all the floor space of the old power house in addition to several rooms in the Mechanic Arts Hall, it does not afford ade - quate facilities for the present activities of the Division of Tests. Ad - ditional space must be provided if the laboratory is to keep pace with the growing needs of highway construction. New testing methods are constantly being introduced and this usually requires additional equipment and machines. At the present time the laboratory has no equipment for making 1 freezing and thawing tests. Such equipment would be very desirable in the study of certain types of stabilized base mixtures. Most all of the more recent specifications now require the use of the Los Angeles abrasion machine instead of the Deval abra - sion machine which has been in use in this laboratory for a number of years. The work involved in testing materials in the laboratory has in - creased materially during the present biennium although there has been a decrease in the number of samples tested. This increase in work is due to the recent developments of more exhaustive tests that are now made on certain materials. EQUIPMENT During the present biennium a number of new machines and other equipment have been added to the laboratory as an aid to testing and investigational work. Cenco-Menzel Autoclave. This apparatus is used primarily for the study of the expansive properties of cement. It may also be used for conducting accelerated soundness and constancy of volume tests. The autoclave consists essentially of a strong steel cylinder within which 1-xl-xlO-inch neat cement bars may be exposed to high pressure steam. The steam is generated by heating water in the bottom of the cylinder with an electric heating unit. The steam is maintained at a tempera - ture of 420 degrees Fahrenheit, corresponding to a gage pressure of approximately 300 pounds per square inch, by a sensitive pressure regulator located in the control cabinet. This regulator operates a relay which controls the heater unit. The test bars are made up from neat cement paste of normal consistency in a special mold which centers stainless steel measuring studs in each end of the bars. After a 24-hour curing period in the moist cabinet at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the length of the bars is measured to the nearest ten thousandth of an </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Inch. The bars are then autoclaved at a temperature of 420 degrees Fahrenheit for a period of three hours after which they are cooled to 70 degrees Fahrenheit and remeasured. Christian Becker Chainomatic Analytical Balance. This balance is of the chainomatic gram rider type and has a sensitivity of 1/20 milligram with full load of 200 grams. The use of this type balance eliminates the use of all fractional weights up to one gram. It is equipped with a magnetic oscillation damper and is especially suited for rapid routine laboratory analyses. ■ /'■"v- HI- w ' ■Ms?\ ■ i I I I K** "- - ~ ' ' ■■ • •' J Cenco-Menzel Autoclave Ubbelode Suspended Level Viscosimeter. This instrument is a modification of the Oswald pipette type of viscosimeter. The bath is thermostatically controlled and maintains a constant temperature within a range of plus or minus twenty-five thousandths of a degree Fahrenheit. This instrument is used to determine the absolute viscos - ity of clear liquids in poises and the kinematic viscosity in centistokes. It is especially suited for making accurate determinations of the vis - cosity index of lubricating oils or for determining the viscosity on any other clear liquid where great accuracy is required.

The reflector button tester was developed for making a compari - son of the different kinds and sizes of reflector buttons, for measure - ment of the decrease in reflecting ability with age, and to sort out used buttons that are defective in reflecting properties. The equip - ment measures the amount of reflected light produced by a light of constant intensity. RESEARCH A program of planned research has not been possible as no special funds have been set aside for this purpose. The greater portion of the research which has been carried on has been accomplished in connec - tion with routine testing and the term investigation would probably more nearly describe the type of work done. It is unfortunate that a planned research cannot be carried out as the expense involved would be small in comparison to the benefit derived. More attention has been devoted to road foundations and to base course construction during- the present biennium than during- any previous period. Most embankments are now compacted with ap - proximately the correct percentage of moisture to obtain the maxi - mum density. Sand-gravel stabilized soil bases, either as a base for a bituminous mat or with an armor coat for a wearing surface, have become accepted methods of construction. At the present time an ex - perimental investigation and study is being made for one project for which the soil is to be stabilized by means of various bituminous products. Large samples of the soil and sand available on the project have been received at the laboratory and approximately thirty experi - mental mixtures have been made using varying percentages of soil, sand, and asphaltic material. In part of the mixtures the type of asphaltic material is being changed to determine which product will be the most effective. From six to twelve 2-x4-inch cylinders are being made from each mixture and these are to be tested in various ways. Another investigation is being made to compare the relative ef - fectiveness of cement, tar, cut-back asphalt oil, and asphalt emul - sion for soil stabilization. It is the intention of the Design Division to set up for construc - tion an experimental road which will be divided into sections 3 miles in length. Each section will be stabilized with one of the products men - tioned provided a laboratory mix can be produced that shows promise of being satisfactory. The three predominant types of soil occurring on the project and a local sand are to be used in the investigation. More than one hundred experimental mixtures will be required. During the present biennium the Division of Tests participated in a cooperative investigation of mineral filler materials for use in bituminous mat surfacing, which was sponsored by a committee of </seg>
            <seg id="p131">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION the Association of Asphalt Paving Technologists who submitted to the participating agencies a number of selected samples of filler ma - terial. All the physical tests commonly used by the various States were made on the samples after which they were classified on the basis of their suitability. In cooperation with the Maintenance Division a series of tests were made on lubricating oils under actual service conditions. A motor was set up and connected to a generator so that a constant load could be maintained. The engine cooling water was also controlled so that it could be kept at a constant predetermined temperature. The lubricating oils used in the test 'were chosen from a group on which the Maintenance Division had received bids. One representative oil was selected from each type of oil based on physical characteristics. In this manner it was possible to compare the oils of widely varying physical characteristics without too much duplication. During each run on an oil the fuel and oil consumption, the amount of blow-by, the crankcase temperature, the oil pressure, and the amount of additive cooling water necessary were observed. Samples of the oil were drained from the crankcase at the end of each run and these were tested in the laboratory to determine the amount of sludge, the in - crease in carbon residue, the per cent dilution, and any corrosive prop - erties the oil might have. The purpose of using the oils under operat - ing conditions was to observe the performance of the different types of oil and to determine if possible which of the physical tests were the more indicative of the behavior of the oil in actual service.

The right of way activities range from the purchase of city prop - erty with comparatively high value, to farm property with lesser value, and they also include purchases of materials for gravel and bitumin - ous surfacing. Right of way for changing water courses, borrow dirt and clay surfacing are also obtained by the Division of Right of Way. The condemnation law is used only as a last resort. A repre - sentative of the Department of Roads and Irrigation always contacts the land owner in an effort to make a direct settlement, but if they are unable to agree as to the amount of damages, the condemnation law is invoked. In direct settlements, payment is made direct to the land owner, but if the property is acquired through condemnation, pay - ment is made through the court. The Federal government does not participate in the purchase of right of way for State or Federal roads. Under a recent ruling of the Federal Bureau, however, the contractors are required to pay for bor - •row dirt unless otherwise specified in the plans. This will decrease the State's expenditures somewhat, but does not reflect materially in this biennium. All right of way records are kept in the Lincoln office of the De - partment of Roads and Irrigation and include contracts with the land owners or their representatives, railroad leases, and right of way deeds. The expenditures for right of way during the 1937-1938 biennium total $728,934.47 and cover 4,229 separate transactions. The amount of money expended is 11 per cent more than in the 1935-1936 biennium, but the number of transactions is 30 per cent larger. Table 21 shows the total amount spent for right of way on the State Highway System in each county and includes road materials and channel changes from October 31, 1936 to October 15, 1938, both dates inclusive. It also includes all purchases for which vouchers have been approved. </seg>

            <seg id="p138">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER DIVISION OF RECORDS AND CONTROL The Division of Records and Control which was organized in May, 1937, is responsible for fiscal and cost accounting, statistics, con - tract and miscellaneous vouchers, pay rolls, Federal progress and final vouchers, compensation, filing and stenographic service for the entire Department of Roads and Irrigation. Our fiscal accounts give us an accurate record of income, obliga - tions and expenditure. Our record of income and expenditure must check each month with that of the State Auditor. The statistical and cost accounting department provides data necessary to analyze our expenditures and to provide statistics required by our Departmental executives as well as interested individuals and organizations. Regardless of how detailed our records are kept, there are frequent calls for statistics slightly different than the form in which they are kept. All pay vouchers and pay rolls are carefully checked numerically for authorization and for delivery or performance before being passed for payment. Federal progress and final reimbursement vouchers are prepared from records in this Department. Underlying documents are made available to the Bureau of Public Roads auditors who make a thorough audit in this office of all final vouchers. COMPENSATION AND INSURANCE The Department of Roads and Irrigation is a self insurer under the Nebraska Workmen's Compensation Act, assuming liability for in - juries suffered by its employees which are incurred while the employee is acting within the scope of his employment with the Department. In operating as a self insurer the Department has effected substantial savings. The cost of compensation to this Department in the maintenance division for the period from November 1, 1936, to and including Octo - ber 31, 1938 was 1.8 per cent of the total pay roll for that division. Under the construction division for the same period, the compensa - tion cost was 1.4 per cent of the total pay roll. </seg>

            <seg id="p184">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER alphabetically in the name of the registered owner. Previous to 1938 the County Treasurer, when making a new registration, was required to use a form of certificate which could be separated into three sec - tions in this office in order that a record would be filed in the motor number, license number and alphabetical file. In 1938 this work was transferred to tabulating machines. This materially reduces the work in the County Treasurer's Office since it is only necessary to enter the required information once on the registration certificate. When the certificate is received in this office, the information is punched on a tabulating card and the certificates filed numerically in license number order. The tabulating cards are then mechanically sorted and listed by make of vehicle in motor number order. The cards are then mechanically resorted according to owner's name and an alphabetical list of motor vehicle owners is then printed. Besides reducing the work in the County Treasurer's Office this procedure makes it pos - sible to answer requests for information in this office within a shorter time. OPERATORS 1 LICENSES Due to several causes, among which was the increasing number of motor vehicle accidents, the 1937 session of the Nebraska Legis - lature amended the Operator's License Law in order to protect the traveling public. The law as amended now requires every applicant to appear personally before an examining officer and satisfy the ex - aminer that he possesses, with or without the aid of spectacles suf - ficient powers of eyesight, and that he is physically fit and has suf - ficient knowledge of the motor vehicle laws to enable him to operate a motor vehicle with a reasonable degree of safety. These licenses are also issued by the County Treasurers, but the examinations are given by employees of the Department of Roads and Irrigation. The County Treasurers began issuance of licenses on September 1 1937 and temporary examiners were appointed by the Department of' Roads and Irrigation and instructed relative to giving examinations. The temporary examiners handled this work from September 1 to Decem - ber 4, 1937, after which the uniformed members of the Nebraska Safety Patrol took over these duties. The following number of appli - cations were made during each month that the temporary examiners handled the examinations: TABLE 35 APP Mifde OnS APP'icat'ons Applications ot p rr be^^ 9 l 7 __Tzzz;:-iz_ \ik Htf Hf~ November, 1937 ZZZZ 187592 Isr'?™ JJ?2 December 1-4, 1937 IZZZZZ 12.'565 "gg Total „ 508.080 503.453 ~^ffl ° f ™* 4&gt;62? rejecti0ns 4 - 282 wer e rejected because of insufficient vision, 99 because of lack of knowledge of the general traffic laws </seg>

A summary of license examinations made after December 4, 1937, will be found in the section devoted to the activities of the Nebraska Safety Patrol. From November 1, 1937, to November 1, 1938, inclusive, 705 per - sons were deprived of their operators' licenses and privileges to oper - ate motor vehicles in the State of Nebraska as a result of convictions in the courts for the following offenses: Drunken driving 574 Reckless driving g 5 Speeding 23 Leaving the scene of accident 8 Incompetency to operate motor vehicle 6 Municipal ordinance violations 5 No operator's license 4 In addition to the foregoing, 75 individuals lost their operators' licenses, certificates of registration, and number plates issued there - under because of their failure to satisfy judgments, which arose out of the operation of motor vehicles, within thirty days after their final rendition, and for non-compliance with the Nebraska Financial Re - sponsibility Law. COMPULSORY MOTOR-VEHICLE INSPECTION Legislative Bill 147 provides for the annual inspection of motor vehicles and the establishment of official inspection stations. In accord - ance with the provisions of this Act, a manual of rules and regulations was adopted to govern the operations of official inspection stations for the inspection of brakes, lighting equipment, steering mechanism horns, mirrors, windshield wipers and other equipment of motor vehicles. The standards used are those fixed by the statutes. One inspection per year for all motor vehicles, trailers and spmi-trailers is compulsory by statute. Municipalities may through ordinance require additional inspections. A fee of 25 cents is fixed for an inspection by a privately owned inspection station. Municipalities may charge not to exceed 50 cents. The Act with respect to inspection became effective in 1938. a delay in starting the inspection was caused by the testing of equipment to be used in official inspection stations, but the results obtained by this testing undoubtedly justified the delay. All brake testers and other equipment used in official inspection stations meet a uniform standard, thereby eliminating considerable confusion and variable inspections. On December 1, 1938, 51 official inspection stations were in opera - tion. These stations are located within a short distance of 90 per cent </seg>
            <seg id="p186">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER of the motor vehicles registered in this State. From June 17, to December 3, 1938, 191,845 inspections were made, and 104,262 vehicles were approved during the same period. MOTOR VEHICLE DEALERS' LICENSING ACT The Motor Vehicle Dealer's License Law was amended by Legis - lative Bill 388 which became effective January 1, 1938. The Dealers Law is administered by A. C. Tilley, State Administrator, and an Adminis - trator's Advisory Board consisting of the following five dealers: Grant L. McFayden, Chairman, Omaha; H. Bomgardner, Scottsbluff; E. E. Bredenberg, Kearney; T. F. Kinman, Grand Island; and F. A. Roehl, Lincoln. This act provides for three classes of motor vehicle licensees: (1) new and used motor vehicle dealers; (2) used motor vehicle dealers; (3) motor vehicle salesmen. The act also provides for the revocation of licenses for certain classes of violations. During the first ten months of administration a total of 4,963 licenses were issued to the three class of licensees as follows: New and Used Motor Vehicle Dealers 1,071 Used Motor Vehicle Dealers 409 Motor Vehicle Salesmen 3,551 During this period nine formal complaints were filed in affidavit form, and after due notice, formal hearing was had upon these com - plaints before the Administrator and the Advisory Board. Following these formal hearings, three licenses were revoked, one license sus - pended for thirty days, one application for license was denied and four complaints were dismissed. The revocations were based upon false statements in the application or upon sales of automobiles not included in the dealers' franchise or license. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION THE NEBRASKA SAFETY PATROL The Nebraska Safety Patrol was organized during the summer of 1937 In accordance with the provisions of Legislative BUI 147 en - acted by the 1937 Legislature. The State Engineer was named as Director of Motor Vehicles, and the State Sheriff was designated as chief officer of the Patrol. The act declared that a Division of Highway Safety and Patrol be created in the Department of Roads and Irrigation. R F Weller who previously had been District Engineer for the Department, was" assigned to the task of organizing the division, to be known as the Nebraska Safety Patrol. In order that he might acquire a thorough knowledge of the requirements, duties, and functions of a traffic control organization, Mr. Weller attended the Iowa Highway Safety Patrol training camp, assuming the role of a candidate for the seven - week training period. This practical experience was of great value m planning the organization of the Nebraska Safety Patrol. Approximately 3,500 Nebraska men applied for positions In the Patrol. Each application was acknowledged and applicants were ad - vised that when available, information would be released concerning the requirements to be met for eligibility in the Patrol. At the start the policy of placing the selection of patrolmen upon a strictly merit basis, was adopted. Preliminary minimum require - ments were established, and candidates unable to meet those require - ments were ineligible for further consideration. This reduced the number of eligible candidates to 850. While Mr. Weller was at the Iowa training camp, applications were received by the State Sheriff, and upon Mr. Weller's return to Lincoln, he in co-operation with the State Sheriff set up the following detailed requirements to be met by all candidates: He must be a citizen of the United States and a resident of Nebraska. He must be between the ages of 25 and 45 years, of good moral character, and capable of passing a rigid physical examination. He must have had at least a high school education or the equivalent, and he must be at least 5 feet, 10 inches in height with weight in conformity to his height The 850 eligible candidates were informed of these requirements and a revised form which included preference requirements, the can - didate's history, qualifications, medical record, and other details was sent to them for use in submitting their applications. The closing date for acceptance of applications was designated as September 1, 1937. After receiving this revised form, 205 men from 66 of Nebraska's counties were selected strictly upon the basis of the preferences estab - lished and were invited to take competitive' written examinations on </seg>

            <seg id="p189">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION September 20, 1937. One hundred sixty-seven men reported for the three-hour examination. That day's procedure began the competitive elimination which ultimately resulted in the group now assigned to the highways. When examinations were administered, candidates were required to place an identification number instead of their names upon all examination papers. The tests included the Army Alpha test which was given by Dr. D. A. Worcester of the University of Nebraska. Then followed a two-hour general-adaptability test,' developed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police which was administered Candidates Who Reported for Competitive Examination at Lincoln, Sept. 20, 1937 by Dr. L. J. O'Rourke of the U. S. Civil Service Commission. The papers of the candidates were graded and segregated into four groups under the supervision of Dr. Worcester. If an applicant's grade fell into the lowest quarter in the grade group of either test, he was ineligible for further consideration. Those candidates whose test results placed them in the highest three-fourth3 of the original group were subjected to personal interviews conducted on September 21, 1937. The interviewing board consisted of the fol - lowing four members: Mr. A. C. Tilley and Mr. A. T. Lobdell, rep - resenting the Department of Roads and Irrigation; Mr. Weller who had been named administrative head of the Patrol; and Mr. E. E. Clark, Chief Deputy State Sheriff, who represented the office of the State Sheriff. Each of the 118 candidates submitted to an identical, personal interview which lasted from 6 to 10 minutes.

            <seg id="p191">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION mitted to discuss either the questions or the results of the interview procedure. Results of the interview were graded by the board mem - bers without discussion of the candidates. On these bases, and upon further character investigation of possible appointees, a list was pre - pared designating 73 men eligible for camp training. To assist in the administration of the training camp, Mr. R. T. Schrein, who during the preliminary organization had been in charge of the issuing of operators' licenses as provided by Legislative Bill 147, was transferred from that work to act as assistant chief and in - structor. He was to act as advisor and to assist in the supervision of the disciplinary training. He was especially qualified for this work because he had served four years as a cadet at the United States Military Academy. By noon of October 9, 1937, 69 candidates reported for camp duty. Four of the eligible applicants were unable to report. The camp or - ganization was set up strictly on a military basis. The first two days were spent submitting all candidates to a rigid physical examination, conducted by a Medical Board of three doctors: Dr. Clinton C. Millet, Omaha; Captain John A. Meredith of the 134th Medical Regiment, Lincoln; and Captain James B. Anderson of the 110th Medical Regi - ment, Lincoln. A comprehensive examination was given, including eye, ear, nose, and throat examination, a Wasserman test, urinalysis, blood pressure test, and other tests necessary to complete the thorough examination. The candidates were photographed and fingerprinted to complete their identification records and to facilitate additional check - ing. As a result of the physical test, three candidates were unable to qualify. All preference requirements were adhered to strictly and failure to meet those requirements meant ineligibility for further com - petitive effort. Another candidate resigned after three days of train - ing, leaving in the training group 65 men to compete for approxi - mately 40 positions. Emergencies caused three more candidates to leave the camp during training, and as a result, 62 men remained at the end of four weeks. On Monday, October 11, the group of candidates was organized into a military company of two platoons consisting of two sections each. Candidates marched in this formation to all drill, field instruc - tion, and lecture-hall classes. The schedule of a routine day in camp was as follows: reveille, 5:45; calisthenics, 6:00 to 6:30; breakfast, 6:30; personal and bar - racks inspection, 7:45; class and field instruction, 8:00 to 12:00; after - noon classes, 1:00 to 5:00; retreat, 5:30; evening classes usually ran from 7:30 to 9:30. Frequent study periods were designated, and taps at 10:30 P.M. closed each camp day. The academic instruction included lecture-quiz courses in motor vehicle laws.

It was attempted to give each candidate a reason - ably broad training in condensed scope because of the limited time available. The candidates were graded in all their work. Periodic tests were given in all subjects and grades were given to the candidates solely on the basis of the quality of their work. After four weeks of Intensive training, during which the candi - dates were restricted to the camp area, 44 men were selected to be retained for one more week of specialized training. The last week's instruction was devoted to emphasizing the type of work to which the individual candidate was to be assigned. The instructors who assisted in the training of the candidates were not connected with the Department. None of the candidates were previously known to the instructors. Consequently, being dis - interested parties, the instructors furnished valuable impartial opinions and ratings of the group. Their recommendations were also considered in the final selection of the first group assigned to the highways Cap - tain Weller acted as Commanding Officer and Lieutenant Schrein was designated as second-in-command during the training period. Captain Phil Dorr, who was instrumental in the organization and development of the Pennsylvania state police, presented the courses in patrolling. Captain Paul Shively and Lieutenant R. O. Bennett of the Lincoln police department supervised the instruction in acci - dent investigation and first aid, respectively. Lieutenant C. J. Stewart was responsible for the marksmanship course, and was assisted by Sergeants Roe Gordon and John Flatten, and Corporal Don Douglas in the infantry drill. Patrolmen S. S. Shaffer and William W. Carter of the Iowa State Highway Patrol supervised the jujitsu course Mr Roy Clark and Mr. Lewis C. Harris instructed the group in criminal identification and criminal investigation. Attorney General R. C. Hunter presented information on court procedure. Mr. George Clifford of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, instructed the candidates in the operation of motorcycles. In conformance with the policy previously mentioned, men chosen for the Nebraska Safety Patrol were selected solely on a merit basis In order to remain on the list of eligible men and finally In order to obtain an appointment, it was necessary for all men appointed to excell all candidates who were eliminated. On November 13, 1937, the group of candidates completed the camp period. Nine days later they were assigned to Nebraska's pri - mary highways, equipped with 28 vehicle units and 6 motorcycles Their uniforms had been tailored at the Nebraska State Penitentiary!

All 44 men left Lincoln with the chief aim of decreasing the number of motor ve - hicle accidents upon Nebraska highways. To coordinate the efforts of the patrolmen who had been as - signed to the highways, an office force was organized. Employees were assigned to this work from the Department of Roads and Irri - gation and office space was made available in the Division of Motor Vehicles. An additional activity assigned to the Patrol was the super - vision of the issuing of motor vehicle operators' licenses and it be - came necessary to provide filing clerks, filing space, and clerical help to furnish a unit responsible for the tabulation of reports and records. With the completion of the organization an educational campaign was begun which had the primary purpose of acquainting the citizens of Nebraska with the requirements and the regulations provided by the motor vehicle laws. In other words, the primary function of the organization was to make every Nebraskan "safety conscious," and to furnish him with a knowledge of the rules of safe and courteous automobile operation. Two avenues of approach were open. One was in the strict enforcement of all motor vehicle laws, but Nebraska was new to such enforcement. Consequently it was decided to attempt the promotion of an educational campaign which would contact groups as well as individuals. Members of the Patrol organization were as - signed to appear before public groups in all parts of Nebraska in an effort to make people better acquainted with the responsibility placed upon them as motor vehicle operators. In ten months of operation patrol officers appeared before 687 public groups, which included 223 schools, 374 civic and service or - ganizations, and 90 commercial groups. The estimated attendances in the several groups totaled 52,031 school children, 59,134 members of civic and service clubs, and 22,550 members of commercial groups. This indicates that 133,715 Nebraska people have been directly contacted in the State in the promotion of the safety campaign. Patrol representatives have appeared on radio broadcasts in at least 14 instances, and there can be no accurate estimate of the number of people who may have heard the message carried in these broad - casts. In connection with the speaking appearances of several of - ficers, motion pictures dealing with safety have been shown, but it Is impossible to determine the number of people who have been in such groups. The educational campaign has not, however, been confined strictly to assembled groups. In the daily activity of the individual patrol - man an attempt has been made to extend certain courtesies to auto - mobile drivers. This has been effected through the use of warning: cards and violation or courtesy cards. In those cases where the violation was not of a serious nature, cards have been used to secure compliance with the various statutes. The indiscriminate use of the </seg>

Motorists who failed to procure operator's licenses be - fore being issued a violation card paid $747.00 for their licenses. Warning cards were issued by the patrol for minor traffic viola - tions. The number of these cards issued, for some of the most fre - quent of these violations were as follows: Stop sign violations 1,528 Careless driving 1,372 Improper lights 478 No driver's license on person 424 The following tabulation gives a comparison of the number of automobile fatalities which occurred in Nebraska during the 11 months that the Nebraska Safety Patrol has been in operation with the cor - responding period of the previous year, and the number of fatalities which occurred during the first 10 months of 1938 compared with the number which occurred during the first 10 months of 1937.

It can be easily seen that the activities of the Nebraska Safety Patrol have been diversified. The results of such activity perhaps can be best determined by the type of cooperation received from the people of Nebraska. Such cooperation only, can materially affect the fatality rate on Nebraska's highways. This, in the last analysis, is of course the paramount objective — to reduce the number of fatal accidents due to careless and negligent driving. The success of any safety campaign can generally be measured by comparison of the records of fatalities from year to year. Nebraska can be thankful and proud to say that thru the combined efforts of all agencies work - ing for safety, fatalities for the first ten months of 1938 compared with those for the same period of 1937 have been reduced 31 per cent. Can such a saving of human lives be measured in terms of dollars? </seg>
            <seg id="p199">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION HIGHWAY PLANNING SURVEY The Department of Roads and Irrigation has set up a project known as the State-wide Highway Planning Survey. The purpose of the survey is to gather a large quantity of de - tailed information and factual data concerning the roads m the rural areas of the State. The survey is a project of related studies in - cluding: (l) a physical inventory of the rural roads, drainage struc - tures and the culture adjoining the roads, tabulating the data into tables and showing the data on four series of maps, namely, base maps showing all open roads and culture, transportation maps show - ing road surface types superimposed upon the base maps, traffic flow and postal routes superimposed upon the transportation maps - (2) a traffic study of the volume and characteristics of the movement of vehicles upon the highway systems, of the commodity and route movement of commercial traffic by capacity classes, of the truck ratings and sizes, of the types of origin and destination of traffic - (3) an accident study to tabulate and classify the relationship be - tween drivers actions, surrounding physical conditions of the roads mechanical properties of the automobile involved, and the time and area; (4) a fiscal study of receipts and disbursements of taxes for all governmental activities with special emphasis on moneys collected and disbursed for highway construction and maintenance- (5) a motor vehicle allocation study to determine the exact source of high - way revenues through the use of these vehicles; i.e., registration fees and gasoline taxes with respect to rural or urban ownership- (6) a road use study to show the travel on the different road systems and city streets by rural and urban residents by occupational classifica - tion; (7) a road life study to determine the probable average life and rate of retirement for each type of surfacing in order to be able to forecast future necessary reconstruction and to determine the annual average cost to own and operate the marked and maintained highway system; and (8) a study of the underlying strata of soil on proposed highway improvements. Samples of these soils are tested in the laboratories and the information is compiled for use in designing - embankments, subgrades and surfacing. The information and data collected and compiled in each phase of the Highway Planning Survey is closely interrelated and the survey as a whole is designed to assist in formulating a long range improve - ment program, to indicate priority of such improvement, to provide a basis for budgeting highway operations, and for the proper control of The collection of the data in the field began in March, 1936 and has been carried as a progressive stage program.

The Works Progress Administration has assisted in collecting and compiling the data with an expenditure totaling $195,207.48. The aver - age number of workers assigned by the Works Progress Administra - tion is approximately one hundred per month. To date the field work of collecting these quantitative data is nearly complete with the exception of one part of the road inventory which is a collection of data concerning municipal railroad grade cross - ings. It is expected that this work will get under way some time this winter. The base series of the county maps are nearly complete. All county base maps have been approved by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, except those of the fourteen counties adjoining the Missouri River. These will be submitted for approval very soon. The transportation series of county maps are nearly complete for those counties for which we have approval of the base series. Trans - portation maps for twenty-five counties have been approved by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads. Other series will be complete by Feb - ruary 1, 1939. The tabulation of data under the road inventory and the motor vehicle allocation studies is nearly complete. It is expected that the tabulation of the commodity and routing study will be complete by De - cember 31, 1938 and the remainder of the tables will be finished by July 1, 1939. One new and interesting feature of the Highway Planning Survey is the automatic traffic recorder, sometimes called the electric eye. Five of these have been installed which record the vehicles passing, by printing on a tape the accumulated totals each hour. These five re - corders have been placed in the following locations: three and one - half miles east of Scottsbluff on Highway No. 26, four miles west of Elmcreek on Highway No. 30, five miles north of Fremont on High - way No. 77 and Highway No. 8, three-fourths mile west of Davenport on Highway No. 4, and one and one-half miles north of Gretna on High - way No. 6. Bids have been received on two additional counters to be placed on Highway No. 20 west of South Sioux City, and on Highway No. 73 and No. 75 between Omaha and Nebraska City. Installation of these two units will start immediately. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION STATE PLANNING BOARD A detailed history of the origin and development of the State Planning movement in Nebraska was given in the Twenty-first Biennial Report of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges. Before reporting on the activities of the present biennium, a very brief review is given of the history of the board up to the beginning of the present biennium The first Nebraska State Planning Board was appointed on February 17 1934 by Governor Charles W. Bryan. As funds were not available' this board did not become active. A second Planning Board was appointed by Governor R. L. Coch - ran in January, 1935. The 1935 Legislature appropriated $15,000 for the use of the board during the biennium. During 1935 the activity of the board was associated with the setting up of an emergency public works program for the State in cooperation with the Public Works Administration. Through assistance furnished by two Federal agencies— the Na - tional Resources Committee and the Works Progress Administration a staff was organized in January, 1936 for the purpose of collecting data on a number of subjects of importance to the people of the State. The board met on February 14, 1936 and approved a program for the guidance of the staff in their fact-finding studies. The study program included the following subjects: Population and Social Trends. Climate. Water Resources. Agri - culture and Land Use. Forestation. Parks, Recreation and Wild Life. Geology and Mineral Resources. Transportation and Com - munication. Power. Education. Industrial Trends. Penal, Correc - tional and Charitable Institutions. Public Health. Cost of Gov - ernment. Base Map. Landscape Planting and Beautification. The Planning Board staff has been continuously engaged in carry - ing out as much of the above program as facilities and personnel have permitted. Some topics were developed more intensively than others because their possibilities became evident as the work progressed As seems natural in a State where the land ranges from semi-arid to sub - humid, the Water Resources study was developed the most intensively of all studies included on the first study program. A comprehensive report on the "Water Resources of Nebraska" was published Decem - ber 1, 1936. The work in water resources was continued in 1937 in coopera - tion with the National Resources Committee. Representatives of the board served on the National Resources Committee Basin Committees and assisted in revising the National Resources Committee 1936 report on "Drainage Basin Problems and Programs." It is realized that this study and programming should be a continuous effort and the State Planning Board and the National Resources Committee are endeavor - ing to make it such in Nebraska. </seg>

            <seg id="p205">DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION Because of the continued widespread interest in water resources, and the demands for the type of material gathered for these studies, a revised edition of the Water Resources Report is being prepared for publication early in 1939. The National Resources Committee Basin Committees met late in the past year and will meet occasionally through 1939. Nebraska has been represented on these committees in the past by R. H. Willis, Chief, Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage; Mr. R. I. Meeker, consulting engineer and expert witness in the Tri-State Liti - gation; and Mr. M. S. Dodd, Assistant Chief, Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage. A typical example of the way the Planning Board staff is able to cooperate with other State departments is demonstrated in one of the phases of the Water Resources Survey. On this survey, work is accomplished that is of direct value to the Bureau of Irrigation and at the same time the contribution of factual material from this survey is an aid in planning work. The Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage maintains a record of water appropriations granted, areas under irrigation, location of diversion dams, ditches and other physical facilities on what are known as township maps. The data for these maps are taken from project maps filed with the Depart - ment of Roads and Irrigation after the applications for water appro - priations have been granted. Some of this information is inadequate and inaccurate, inasmuch as many of the early project maps were not based on actual surveys. For several years the bureau has been very anxious to conduct field surveys necessary for collecting basic field data to be used in the revision of these maps. It has been un - able to do so because of inadequate funds and a limited personnel. The Planning Board is now cooperating with the bureau in making actual field surveys. The data thus collected will be used in revising the township maps. Another example of this type of cooperation with other State departments is the survey of Nebraska airports which is described later. The 1937 session of the Legislature gave legal status to the State Planning Board and at the same time authorized the board "to make a complete and thorough survey and study of the lands, buildings and equipment owned or controlled by the State of Nebraska and operated by the Normal School Board, Board of Control and the University of Nebraska and, with the approval of the Governor, such studies, sur - veys and investigations of the natural, social and economic resources of the State as may be deemed advisable and in the interest of the public." Ten thousand dollars were appropriated to the Planning Board for the purpose of conducting the Institutional survey. The pur - pose of the survey was to gather basic factual material to assist the Board in the preparation of a 10-year building program for the State Institutions.

In its first meeting of the 1937-38 biennium the Planning Board recognized that the two surveys assigned by the Legislature should be given the most urgent attention, and in addition adopted other studies to round out a broad study program for the biennium. Some of the studies on this program had been developed previously, to some extent. Works Progress Administration and National Resources Com - mittee assistance had already been provided for the studies adopted. The subjects included were as follows: State Institutions. Tuberculosis in Nebraska. Water Resources. Population and Population Trends. Aeronautics. Base Map of Ne - braska. Parks, Parkways and Recreational Areas. Industrial Sur - vey! Public School Education. Definite progress has been made on all except the last two sub - jects on the program. On the survey of the institutions, physical sur - veys of each institution operated by the Board of Control and the Normal Board were made and similar information was furnished by the University of Nebraska. From this information studies were made of the use of space in these institutions. Maps were prepared show - ing the physical layout at each institution. Statistical material has been compiled showing types of construction, ages of buildings, capac - ities of buildings, population growth, enrollment experience, records of expenditures, and so on. Committees were appointed from the membership of the Planning Board by Mr. A. C. Tilley, Chairman, to inspect the physical plants of the various institutions.

On the Board of Control Committee the time spent at the various institutions which were eighteen in number, and in committee meetings ran as high as fourteen days for some mem - bers of the committee. This did not include time required to travel from their homes to places of meeting. In cases where highly technical questions were involved the com - mittees have called in expert consultant service to assist them in arriving at decisions. The National Resources Committee has sup - plied Mr. Burdette Lewis, a nationally recognized authority on the operation of the types of institutions operated by the Board of Control, and Dr. Fred J. Kelly, Chief of the Division of Higher Education in the Office of Education, Washington, D. C. Additional consultant serv - ice has been obtained directly by the board itself. The recommendations of the committees were made to the Plan - ning Board and the board submitted a recommended ten-year build - ing program to Governor R. L. Cochran, as required by statute. The survey of human tuberculosis, the second survey specifically directed by the Legislature, has been conducted with the cooperation of the State Department of Health, State and local medical societies and the State Tuberculosis Association. A Survey Advisory Committee was appointed by Mr. Tilley to make recommendations on. the techni - cal aspects of the survey and on the type of survey to be made. This committee, made up of representatives of interested organizations, was as follows: Representing: State Medical Association Dr. E. W.

The material was presented with a liberal use of maps, graphs and charts. This report, Nebraska's Population, was pub - lished December 15, 1937. About 700 copies were distributed to schools, libraries, government agencies and interested individuals. By means of a W.P.A. project a survey was made of each air - port in the State. Maps were completed of each airport showing run - ways, buildings, lights and other physical equipment on the airport itself and trees, poles, buildings and other obstructions located near the airport. The topography in general was shown, so that estimates can be made of the cost of future extensions to the runways and enlargements to the fields where desirable. A handbook, incorporating these maps, is being prepared for publication by the Aeronautics Com - mission for the use of pilots, of the United States Bureau of Air Com - merce, and of persons in general who are interested in this type of material. A base map of Nebraska in 22 sections has been developed on the Lambert System modified conic projection. The U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation data have been used as a control for this map work. While these maps are primarily base maps, occasion - ally other material is located that seems worthwhile for incorporation on these maps. As an example, drainage as taken from the AAA and other aerial photographs was transferred to these maps, resulting in drainage maps of the State that probably cannot be duplicated else - where. A file of the available maps of Nebraska and of its subdivisions is being developed which will reveal readily what maps are available, what they contain, and where they are located. This file will not only fill a need that has developed in the work of the staff itself, but will be helpful to a number of Federal and State agencies as well. In cooperation with the University of Nebraska College of Agri - culture and the U. S. Bureau of Agricultural Economics, a Land-Use Study is underway in 34 counties of Nebraska. This study involves gathering information from several sources in each county and will eventually result in a series of maps of each county showing the culti - vated and non-cultivated land, the degree of tax delinquency, the status of mortgage indebtedness, the type of ownership and the operating unit patterns in the entire county. It has been demonstrated here and in other states that this material is very useful to county, State and Federal groups interested in farm problems. This study will be expanded to include the remaining 59 counties in the near future because of the interest shown by the National Re - sources Committee in a nation-wide inventory of publicly owned land, a phase of the above Land-Use Survey. At the request of the Legislative Council, the Planning Board con - ducted a survey of the use of space in the State House. An inventory </seg>

The Planning Board, at the end of this biennium, is moving from the fact-finding stages of the work with the State Institutions, Water Resources, and Tuberculosis to the analyzation of the data and to a beginning of actual planning. In other phases of the work, such as the Land-Use Study, the board is still in the fact-finding stage. "Planning involves an analysis of the present situation and a pro - jection of present trends to the end that, within the powers of govern - ment, desirable movements may be encouraged and steps taken to prevent the continuation of the undesirable.

Dear Sir: Pursuant to the usual custom, I have the honor of reporting result - ant activities of the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power, and Drainage, for the biennium ending September 30, 1938. Water Supply The annual water supply of the Platte River basin for the 1937-1938 biennium was nineteen per cent greater than the 1935-1936 biennium. The supply for the months of July and August of the 1937-1938 biennium was forty-four per cent greater than the 1935-1936 biennium. However, the supply in July and Augut of the 1937-1938 biennium was approxi - mately twenty-seven per cent below the ten year mean (1928-1937). The section, State Line to Mitchell, received an excess of approximately seven per cent above the ten year mean during July and August of the 1937-1938 biennium. During the same period the section, North Platte to Overton, had a deficiency of approximately sixty-six per cent . The snowfall (reported by the United States Weather Bureau of Cheyenne, Wyoming) in the higher elevations of the North Platte River basin as of April 30, was 116 per cent of normal in 1937 or twenty-nine per cent greater than 1936. For 1938, it was ninety-seven per cent of normal. The water equivalent was 13.78 inches and 11.71 inches respectively. The runoff above the Pathfinder dam for the year ending Septem - ber 30, 1937, was approximately 1,131,000 acre-feet or 99.4 per cent of the twenty-eight year mean (1911-1938), and approximately 1,335,000 acre-feet for the year ending September 30, 1938, or 99.8 per cent. Approximately 653,000 acre-feet of the 1937 runoff were impounded in the Pathfinder Reservoir, and approximately 907,000 acre-feet of the 1938 runoff were impounded in the Pathfinder and Alcova Reservoirs. In addition to the water impounded in the Pathfinder and Alcova Reser - voirs, there were approximately 53,000 acre-feet of the natural runoff Impounded in the Guernsey Reservoir between May 1 and September 30, 1937, and 40,000 acre-feet for a similar period in 1938. The quantity of storage water reaching the Wyoming-Nebraska Line, as reported from the Guernsey office of the U. S. Reclamation </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Service, was approximately 81,500 acre-feet in 1937, and 72,900 acre-feet in 1938. The total natural flow passing the State Line between May 1 and September 30, 1937, was approximately 299,800 acre-feet; 136,000 acre - feet passed the Sutherland Gaging Station, and 69,000 acre-feet passed the Overton Station. In 1938, the natural flow passing the State Line during the months of May to September inclusive, was approximately 249,300 acre-feet; 315,800 acre-feet were flowing in the North Platte River at the Sutherland Station; and approximately 316,000 acre-feet passed the Overton Station. The total annual diversions of natural flow between the State Line and Odessa were approximately 869,500 acre-feet, and 639,300 acre-feet in 1937 and 1938 respectively. All the water in the basin between July 1 and September 30, 1937, and between July 15 and August 28, 1938, was consumed before reach - ing Odessa, Nebraska. The total flow of the South Platte River at North Platte for the 1935-1936 water years was sixty-seven per cent greater than the total 1937-1938 flow. The former biennium flow was eighty-four per cent, and the latter biennium flow was fifty per cent of the ten year mean (1928-1937). The total flow of the South Platte River at Julesburg, Colorado, for the 1935-1936 biennium was fifty-six per cent greater than the total flow for the 1937-1938 biennium. Th&lt;; 1935-1936 total flow was ninety - four per cent of the ten year mean (1928-1937), and the total 1937-1938 flow was sixty per cent of the ten year mean. The Western Irrigation District diverts from the South Platte River just east of the Colorado-Nebraska Line, a distance of about seven miles from the Julesburg Gaging Station. The records show that the Western Irrigation District diverted in the 1937 season, 32,239 acre-feet, and 28,169 acre-feet in 1938, or 2.80 acre-feet and 2.24 acre-feet per acre, respectively. Several farm units of the district received groundwater by pumping during the biennium. This canal was closed ten days during the first half of August 1938, in favor of Kearney irrigation and power. The total flow of the White River at Crawford for this biennium was twenty per cent less than the 1935-1936 biennium; the Elkhorn River at Waterloo was one per cent more; the Republican River at Hardy was forty-one per cent less; the Big Blue at Barncston was twenty-eight per cent less; the Little Blue was twenty-six per cent less; the Frenchman River at Culbertson was twenty-six per cent less; Lodgepole Creek was ten per cent less; and the Loup at Columbus was twenty-two per cent less. Pump Irrigation Apparently, an increase in groundwater diversions by use of pumps in all parts of the State has taken place during the biennium. The </seg>

            <seg id="p220">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER diverted eighty per cent between May 1 and September 30, and twenty per cent during the remainder of the year. The third section diverted • forty-eight per cent between May 1 and September 30, and fifty-two per cent between October 1 and April 30. Approximately twenty-two per cent of the water diverted in the first section is storage water. Appropriations antedating December 25, 1892, were not closed during 1937, but appropriations subsequent to December 25, 1892, were permitted to take natural flow in the order of priority intermittently. Prom August 13 to 16, 1938, all appropriations subsequent to September 11, 1882, were closed to natural flow. Water Commissioners Four acting water commissioners were on duty every day including Sundays and holidays in the Platte River basin from April 20 to Septem - ber 30, 1937, and from May 1 to September 30, 1938. One water commissioner supervised the distribution of the Lodgepole Creek water in Kimball County during both seasons and one on Lodgepole Creek in Deuel and Cheyenne Counties for each season. One water superin - tendent was in charge of distribution for each season on the White River, Niobrara River, and Hat Creek. One water commissioner admin - istered the water of the Republican and Frenchman Rivers during - the biennium. Two hydrographers were occupied during the entire biennium in the Platte River basin. The personnel of the Bureau of Irrigation was not large enough to perform all the duties assigned to it, hence no supervision was attempted on the South Platte River as provided by the Colorado-Nebraska Compact, and for the same reason no administration of the water in streams of the State east of Kearney was provided. As yet no request has been made to the Bureau of Irrigation for administration of the available water supply of the Loup River basin and the Blue River basins. However, there can be no doubt as to requests being made during the coming biennium. The normal flow in these basins is over appropriated, consequently, requests will be made on the Bureau of Irrigation to divide the water supply in times of scarcity. As now organized, the Bureau cannot take over any more administrative duties. Hydrography Section 81-6308, Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, provides that the Department of Roads and Irrigation shall make stream measurements as a basis for administration of the water supply. Under an annual cooperative agreement between the United States Geological Survey and the State of Nebraska, stream measurements are made by the Geological Survey hydrographers to the same extent that measurements are made by Nebraska hydrographers or its equiva - lent in equipment used in that work. </seg>
            <seg id="p221">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION In the 1937 water year, Nebraska expended for hydrographical work ?15,685.04, and $15,367.17 in the 1938 water year. The Geological Survey expended an equivalent amount. This arrangement is not exactly a matching proposition. It was necessary for Nebraska to invest this amount of money in this work had there been no cooperation, however, twice as much work was accom - plished through cooperation. Nebraska has two hydrographers on its payroll and could use four advantageously. Since the present cooperation was started in 1931, the United States Geological Survey established a majority of the existing gaging stations with substantial shelters and automatic water stage recorders, mostly of the latest type. In addition to equipment, the Survey has paid observers for two daily readings at a number of gaging stations that do not have automatic recorders. The Survey maintains an experienced hydrographer at Bridgeport who makes all the stream and canal measurements in the basin between the Wyoming-Nebraska Line and Bridgeport, and also one experienced hydrographer is employed by the Survey to maintain twenty-one stations in the eastern half of the State. The Survey computes the records of all the cooperative stations. The number of cooperative stations in Nebraska on September 30, 1938, was sixty. Of this number twenty-nine are furnished, maintained, and equipped with automatic recorders by the United States Geological Survey, one by the United States Weather Bureau, and five by the State of Nebraska. Fourteen stations are equipped with chain gages anfl eleven with staff gages. Each of the thirty-five stations is equipped with one automatic recorder with the exception of Julesburg, Colorado, and Bridgeport, Nebraska; the former station has three recorders and the latter has two. One of the recorders at Bridgeport is a long distance recorder. The cooperative work of the Geological Survey is of great help to the State under the present agreement arrangements, and is very much appreciated. Precipitation and Evaporation. The annual precipitation in the Platte Valley west of Lexington for the 1938 water year was approximately eighteen per cent greater than the 1937 water year. East of Lexington it was approximately fourteen per cent more than 1937. In the northwestern part of the State, the precipitation for the 1938 water year was approximately forty-one per cent greater than the 1937 water year; and around Cul - bertson, the 1938 water year received ninety-five per cent more precipi - tation than in 1937. The evaporation for the months of May to September inclusive was as follows: At Mitchell, 1938 was twelve per cent less than 1937; at Bridgeport, 1938 was five per cent less than 1937; and at North Platte, the 1938 evaporation was three per cent greater than 1937. Evaporation at Bridgeport was 105 per cent of the eight year mean in 1937, and 94 per cent in 1938. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER Township Maps It is very helpful to the Bureau of Irrigation, as well as to the general public, to have available maps showing irrigation works, irri - gated areas, streams, reservoirs, and other useful data. The Bureau of Irrigation has attempted, without success, the continuance of the policy adopted about the year 1900, of making new and revising old township maps on tracing cloth. The personnel of the Bureau of Irrigation is not sufficient in number to keep the township maps up-to-date. The maps are approximately ten to fifteen years in arrear. The Department must necessarily forego the duty of certifying these township maps when requests are made for blue prints by attorneys and others for use in lawsuits or other purposes. Through arrangements with the Nebraska State Planning Board, a survey of Lodgepole and Boardman Creeks, and canals diverting therefrom, was made during the spring and summer of 1938. Ultimately the results of this survey will be the basis for revision of only those township maps coming within the limits of the survey. Aerial survey maps, covering more than half of the state, were recently made and are available. The survey of the area between the Missouri river and the west line of Keith County was sponsored by the Agricultural Adjust - ment Administration and Soil Conservation Service coordinating, and the area in the North Platte Valley from the Wyoming-Nebraska Line to the east boundary of Morrill County was surveyed by the United States Forest Service. Although these maps may be obtained at a comparatively small cost by the Department of Roads and Irrigation and used for the pur - pose of revising the township maps, the Bureau of Irrigation does not have a draftsman available for this work. Reservoirs The Oliver Reservoir receives its storage supply from Lodgepole Creek runoff above the Bushnell Gaging Station in Kimball County. It has a capacity of 5500 acre-feet. On October 10, 1936, there was a carry-over of 320 acre-feet, and there were 4305 acre-feet impounded prior to September 30, 1937, making a total of 4625 acre-feet of storage water available for the 1937 season. On September 30, there were 430 acre-feet carry-over and 6850 acre-feet impounded prior to September 1938, making available for the 1938 season 7280 acre-feet of storage. The Whitney Reservoir record for 1937 is not very accurate as too long periods of time have elapsed between observations to give any more than a fair estimate of the contents. On September 1, 1936, there were 400 acre-feet in the reservoir. Between that date and May 3, 1937, there were 8130 acre-feet impounded, making a total of 8530 acre-feet avail - able for the 1937 season. On August 19, 1937, there were in storage 3770 acre-feet. Between August 19, 1937, and September -14, 1938, there were impounded 6825 acre-feet, making a total of 10,595 acre-feet of storage water available for the 1938 season. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION The Bennett Reservoir is a channel reservoir on the Lodgepole Creek approximately three miles east of Kimball. The owners of this reservoir have not supplied the Department with weekly information during the 1937-1938 biennium. The Kilpatrick Reservoir is in the same situation, and it is possible that these two reservoirs are inactive. Crescent Lake is a natural sand hill reservoir located about thirty - five miles north of Oshkosh, Nebraska. The water surface elevation of this lake on November 5, 1936, was 3779.2; September 24, 1937, 3776.5; and August 24, 1938, 3776.9; a drop of 2.3 feet. This drop is charged to evaporation. No water was withdrawn for irrigation during the 1937-1938 biennium. The Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District diverted from the North Platte River, between November 4, 1936, and March 31, 1937, 189,142 acre-feet for storage in the Sutherland Reservoir by virtue of Application 2350. The Sutherland Reservoir had a carry-over of approximately 250 acre-feet of live storage on November 4, 1936. By March 31, 91,550 acre-feet were impounded making a total of 91,800 acre-feet storage water in the Sutherland Reservoir. Impounding of natural flow from the North Platte was discontinued on March 31, 1937. The total quantity of water returned to the river through the penstocks for the water year ending September 30, 1937, was 53,110 acre-feet. Diversion from the North Platte River was resumed on March 20, 1938, and continued until June 11, 1938. A total of 98,940 acre-feet was diverted. Between April 3, and June 9, 1938, 46,241 acre-feet were impounded in the Sutherland Reservoir. No water was returned to the river during the 1938 water year. The quantity in the reservoir on September 30, was 17,845 acre-feet. The Department is not fully informed as to the number of small reservoirs in the State constructed by or under the supervision of several Federal agencies. The capacity of these small reservoirs vary, but probably will average around eight-acre feet. These small reservoirs retard, primarily, the runoff, thereby reducing erosion. It is also reported that the water impounded will be used for stock purposes. However, only recorded permits will be protected by the Department of Roads and Irrigation. New Development The hydro-electric power and storage project of the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District is completed and was operated intermittently during the 1937 and 1938 water years. The hydro-electric power project of the Loup River Public District, near Columbus, is completed and has been operating since March 1937. During the middle summer months of 1938, the North Loup River Public Power and Irrigation District supplied water to an unreported acreage, and approximately 750 acres were irrigated within the Middle Loup Public Power and Irrigation District. </seg>
            <seg id="p224">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER The Phelps Canal of The Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District diverted 24,018 acre-feet of water to 3,925 acres of land in Phelps County north of Holdrege in 1938. Approximately sixty-nine per cent was diverted between October 1 and July 1, fifteen per cent in July, three per cent in August, and thirteen per cent in September. Litigation Hearings in the Nebraska vs. Wyoming and Colorado suit, which was initiated in the Supreme Court of the United States in September 1934, were held before Honorable M. J. Doherty, Master in Chancery. Nine sessions comprising one hundred days of hearing were held during the 1937 and 1938 biennium, four of which were at Lincoln, three at North Platte, and two at Scottsbluff. The United States Reclamation Service was permitted by the United States Supreme Court to enter the suit as an intervenor on May 16, 1938. It is expected that Nebraska will rest in the presentation of its case by early spring of 1939. The suit of United States of America vs. A. C. Tilley, R. H. Willis, and Farmers Irrigation District was initiated November 20, 1937. This suit was filed in the Federal District Court in North Platte, Nebraska, seeking to enjoin the State officials from permitting the Farmers Irri - gation District of Scottsbluff from receiving more water than is set out in the Warren Act Contract schedule, and to enjoin the Farmers Irrigation District from intercepting and using the water enroute to the North Platte River from irrigated area within the boundaries of the Pathfinder Irrigation District. The case affects a situation in which the Federal Government is asserting the ownership of return flow, or in other words, claiming the residue of an appropriation of water diverted from the North Platte River and applied to lands reclaimed by the water users within the Pathfinder Irrigation District. This case was argued before Federal District Judge J. A. Donohoe during June 20 to' 28, 1938, inclusive. No decision was rendered at the time of pub - lishing this report. A suit entitled "State of Nebraska Ex Rel., Horace Cary, et al vs. R. L. Cochran, et al" was started January 29, 1938. The action was a mandamus suit filed in the Buffalo County District Court by the irrigators under the Kearney Canal, and the Central Power Company of Kearney to force the Department of Roads and Irrigation to admin - ister the available water supply of the Platte River Basin on a strictly priority basis. The hearings were held in Kearney August 1 to 5 and August 10 to 13, 1938, inclusive. No decision was rendered at the time of publishing this report. In the late summer of 1936, injunction proceedings were initiated by the Winters Creek Irrigation Company and the Enterprise Irrigation District to prevent the Department of Roads and Irrigation from limit - ing the quantity of water diverted by these two projects to three </seg>

The Department's action was prompted by the insistence of several projects diverting between Bridgeport and Minatare. These projects were among the many having rights subsequent to October 17, 1889, and had been closed and denied water for most of the season. The water users under these projects called on the Department and demanded such projects having received three acre-feet be closed as provided by Section 81-6311, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, and permit subse - quent appropriators to use this water on their beet crops in the order of priority. The case is now in the State Supreme Court.

            <seg id="p690">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OP THE DISCHARGE OF THE NORTH PLATTE RIVER AT BRIDGEPORT. The charts on the opposite page depict the result of applied .statis - tical methods of analyzation to the discharge records of the North Platte River at Bridgeport. Such presentation reveals certain discharge charac - teristics that would otherwise be overlooked in the usual chronological tabulation of the records. The Chart "Monthly Discharge Variability," shows the rate of dis - charge and the quartile points used as limits between which 25 per cont of the discharges occur. The 25th percentile, or Q, is the first quarter or quartile point in the column; the point below which lie 25 per cent of the discharges. In like manner, the 50th percentile or the median is the quar - tile point in the column below and above which lie 50 per cent of the dis - charges. For example, during the month of June for the fifteen years of record, the flow fluctuated between the minimum and 747 second-f€-et 25 per cent of the time. The sum of all the discharges below Q t wati con - verted to mean acre-feet by dividing by 15, the number of year.'., and multiplying the quotient by the constant factor, 1.9835 used in charging second-feet to acre-feet. The Chart "Mean Monthly Run-Off," show.-! the quantitative values by months for each of the quartile points. It will be observed that the run-off produced below Q,, or 25 per cent of the time amounted to an average of 7.005 acre-feet or 3.6 per cent of the total run-off for that month. From the Variability chart, it will be observed that between Q, and the median, the limits of variation were 747 and 1,800 second-feet. This 25 per cent of time produced an average of : 7.967 acre-feet or 9.3 per cent of the run-off for June. A study of the two charts for any or all the months will show the fluctuations of discharge in second-feet for each 25 per cent of time and the corresponding quanti - tative values in acre-feet. A comparison of the two measures of central tendency shows the mean sometimes more and other times less than the median. When the departures above the mean are more extreme or numerous than those be - low, the median is less than the mean. The converse is true when the departures below the mean are more extreme than those above. For ex - ample, the mean daily flow at this station for the month of June was 3,269 second-feet, but 32 per cent of the time the flow was above the mean and 68 per cent of the time it was below; thus indicating that the departures above were less numerous and more extreme than those below. The so-called "peak flows" resulted in a high mean for the month, but this average was not indicative of a uniform dependable supply. The median for the same month was 1,800 second-feet, and therefore, 50 per cent of the time the flow was above, and 50 per cent below this figure. The median of 1,800 second-feet was 1,469 second-feet less than the mean. Therefore, when considering dependability of stream-flow, the median, as a measure of central tendency, is more reliable than the mean. </seg>
