            <seg id="p002">THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA SECRETARY'S OFFICE To the Board of Regents of the UnitersUy of Nebraska; Gentlemen : I submit herewith a detailed statement of all receipts and expenditures of money for the support of the university, the farmers' institutes, the North Platte, Scottsbluff and Valentine substations, for the two years ended November 30, 1910. All of the items of the accompanying statement have been examined and checked with the books of account and the vouchers on file, by the expert accountant regularly serving your finance committee, as is hereinafter certified. Publication of these detailed financial statements is required by law as a part of the regents' biennial report to the Governor. For part one of this report I have prepared general summaries which give in condensed form the expenditures which are itemized in part two. Those summaries show the amounts of the several funds placed at the disposal of the regents by the legislature of 1909, the total amounts expended there - from for the two years ended November 30, 1910, the total cash received and disbursed for the same period and the unexpended balances at the close of business on November 30, 1910. Statistical tables of useful information have been added to the usual financial summaries in part 1. One of these shows the distribution of expenditures by departments. Another shows the total registration of students according to subjects in the various departments. Respectfully submitted, Lincoln, Nebraska. J. S. Dales, December 7, 1910. Secretary. 2 </seg>

            <seg id="p177">•New Substation at Scottsbluff EXPENDITURES Certified to the State Auditor from November SO, 1 909 to and including November SO, 1910 LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION OF 1909 (House Roll No. 18. See Bushee vs. Regents 125 N. W. Rep. 660.) •The appropriations for two new substations were authorized by the legislature of 1909 to be paid from the state general fund. The items in the general appropriation bill were vetoed by the Governor. The bills providing for the stations (House Rolls 18 and 114) had been passed earlier in the session: they were copies substantially of the North Platte substation act of former years and made the appropriations payable from "the temporary university fund." But an integral part of that fund cannot lawfully be used for any purpose but instruction and facilities therefor. Ninety-five per cent of the mill tax portion of the university fund had also been appropriated by a separate act (House Roll 201) to the usual maintenance of the university for the two years 1909 and 1910. Under these conditions the regents, for their own guidance and that of other state officers, sought direction by the Supreme Court. In state ex rel. Bushee vs. Regents, on rehearing, it was held that the substation appropriations were payable from the mill tax portion of the uni - versity fund in addition to the "95 per cent of the tax levies for the two yean already appropriated for general university purposes. The effect of all these events was to delay starting the substations until the second year of the pres - ent biennium and also to materially reduce the percentage of the tax levies, reserved by the regents for delinquencies.
