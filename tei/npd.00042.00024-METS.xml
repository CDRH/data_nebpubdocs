            <seg id="p003">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 533 NEBRASKA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF, OMAHA, NEBRASKA To his Excellency, Honorable Keith Xeville, Governor, and to the Honorable Members of the Board of Com - mixxioners of State Institutions, Henry Gerdes, Silas A. Holcomb, and Eugene O. May field. Gentlemen: I have the honor to submit to you this the twenty - fourth biennial report of the Nebraska School for the Deaf for the period from December 1, 1916, to December 1, 1918. The number of pupils in attendance on the date of the last report, namely, November 30, 1916, was 184, of whom ninety-five were boys and eighty-nine girls. During the two years of the biennium ending November 30, 1918, forty - six new pupils, twenty-nine boys and seventeen girls, have been admitted, and eighteen former pupils, seven boys and eleven girls, have been re-admitted, giving a total enroll - ment of 248 pupils, of whom 131 were boys and 117 girls. During the biennium thirteen pupils, two boys and eleven girls, have completed the required course of study and graduated; one boy has died and sixty-five pupils, twenty - nine boys and thirty-six girls, have left school for various reasons. This leaves present at this date 169 pupils, of whom ninety-nine are boys and seventy girls. The slight reduction in school population of fifteen pupils is due with - out doubt to war conditions, requiring the presence at home of pupils to help about the farm and household. Now that the war is ended, another term will, we may confidently expect, bring back the absentees and our enrollment will reach its usual figures. Statistics show the ratio of the deaf to the hearing in the country and the world to be one to 1,500, and this ratio of course prevails among children of school age. All states and civilized countries make provision for the education of children deprived of hearing, with the result that such </seg>
            <seg id="p004">534 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF children are in effect, when grown, restored to society, as - suming and discharging to the full all duties and responsi - bilities of citizenship, thus contributing to the general wel - fare of the state, instead of being a heavy charity burden, which they would be if uneducated and undisciplined. There are, according to the latest available figures, 169 schools for the deaf in the United States, providing educa - tional advantages for 13,703 pupils. These children are taught to read and write and are given instruction in all branches taught in the common schools. In addition the great majority (11,123 or 81 per cent), are taught speech, that is, they are taught to talk and to read the lips. While the deaf have been taught in this country over 100 years, at first wholly by silent methods, it is only within the last fifty years that speech has been taught and used as a means of instruction. In that period the increase in speech teaching in the schools, at first slow, but latterly very rapid, may be considered as the final verdict of modern educators, upon the question of methods and as to the practicability and value of the oral method as a means of educating deaf children and of equipping them for life. Speech for the totally deaf child is difficult to impart and in the nature of the case it will vary in quality with the individual, but in any case the speech and power of lip-reading finally possessed constitute a distinct plus, to be counted and included as a part of the education, superior on all counts, which present day teaching gives. Since the founding of this school in 1869, nearly fifty years ago, a total of 1,004 children have been admitted to its privileges. Of this number 135 have completed the course of instruction, receiving the diploma of graduation; the remainder having attained to varying stages of ad - vancement, to fit them for the duties and responsibilities of citizenship. Of the graduates forty-two have been ad - mitted to Gallaudet college, the national institution for the deaf in Washington, from which a number have graduated. The school now has four representatives in attendance at the college. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 535 AGE OF ADMISSION Each child, upon admission to the school, is placed un - der oral instruction, with it as our aim that he shall learn to speak and to read speech upon the lips. If started in school at a sufficiently early age the vocal organs are flex - ible, are all equally undeveloped, and they can be readily trained through exercise and instruction, whereas if en - trance to school is unduly delayed the vocal muscles will — a few of them through exclusive untrained exercise — have become over-developed, all to a degree to make control and training extremely difficult. Seven years of age has been found a maximum that it is not well to exceed in starting a deaf child in school. This school is now taking children at six, with good results observable in qualities of voice and articulation secured. BEGINNING STEPS In order to give reply to the oft-repeated inquiry, "How do you begin?" I will here outline the earlier steps taken: Voice being the vehicle to be molded into speech, the first work is to develop the voice and train it, with a view to secure tone, pitch, resonance and volume. The piano is used as an aid in this work, the children being guided largely by the sense of feeling (with hands on the instru - ment) to give them perceptions of the distinctions involved. The first step in actual speech production is training the child to articulate the non-vocal, or breath, consonants, p, t, f, k, etc., the corresponding vocal consonants b, d, v, g, m, n, ng, 1, r, etc.. and the open vowel a (usually spelled ar and pronounced ah). The consonants are then combined with this vowel (similarly with other vowels learned later), thus pa(r), ta(r), fa(r), ba(r), da(r), ma(r), a(r)p, a(r)t, a(r)m, etc. These are not taught as words at first, but merely as combinations of elements. Later they are used in teaching real words. The first real words taught are arm, thumb, tooth, mouth and similar words made up of easily articulated elements. Lip-reading begins with commands, such as "stand up." "walk," "run," "jump," "fall," "open </seg>
            <seg id="p006">\ &gt; THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF 536 the door," "open a window," etc., the children watching the lips and observing the commands. Soon real language, that is, language that is spontaneous and personally useful to the child, is developed. The sign language is not used, as experience teaches that it forms a barrier to the best progress in the acquisition of speech and written language, and it tends moreover to limit thinking, and consequently mental development, to the measure and level of its crude and meager resources for thought expression. Natural signs, or motions, are employed, as they must be, in the beginning stages of teaching, but they are abandoned at once upon the acquisition of words. THE SCHOOL COURSE The course of study provided by the school embraces twelve grades, which should be completed by the average pupil in twelve years, and the expectation is that soon the school will be brought to a standard where graduation will be earned in this time. The scholastic training of the school is given in eighteen classes, of which fourteen are oral and four are manual. The advanced grades of the oral department are under the direction of Mr. H. L. Welty; the intermediate and primary oral grades under Miss Edith Wyckoff, and the advanced manual grades under Mr. J. W. Sowell. In the oral classes speech, Up-reading and writing are depended upon for all purposes of communication and instruction; in the manual classes, the hand alphabet is used in conjunction with writing to the same ends. LANGUAGE TAUGHT BY USING IT Thus, it may be pointed out, the English language, in one or another of its spoken or visible forms, is used, to the exclusion of the sign-language, in instruction through - out the school, it being recognized that, as a language is learned through use, it is best, most easily, and most quickly learned through its exclusive use. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 537 ALL SUBJECTS TAUGHT But while language is the chief need of the deaf, con - stituting therefore the chief subject of instruction, the course of study of the school embraces all subjects taught in schools for the hearing. The following is an outline of the course at present pursued in the several departments of the school: First Grade Sense-training, Lip-reading, Voice Development, Lan - guage, Numbers, Sunday School Work. Second Grade Speech, Speech-reading, Voice Development, Language, Numbers, Sunday School Work.

INDUSTRIAL COURSES PROVIDED Iii addition to the literary instruction given, the school provides industrial training along a number of lines — in carpentry and cabinet making, mechanical drawing, print - ing, and gardening for the boys; and in sewing, dress - making, cooking, laundry work and house work for the </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 539 girls. The aim is to train the hand and the brain in the use of tools and in the making of material things; also by use to teach the vocabulary and the peculiar language forms pertaining to the several industries taught. I have before in former reports dwelt upon the importance of thus linking together the scholastic and the industrial train - ing of the school to the end that each shall reinforce and con - tribute to the success of the other, and I have noted with no little satisfaction that since the industrial teachers have their responsibilities and opportunities and have come to recognize themselves as teachers of language, there has been an improvement both in the language of the pupils throughout the school and in the quality of the work done as well. There is nothing more certain than that language expression makes for precision in thinking and that thought precisely expressed or clearly apprehended in language can be and will be the more readily and precisely transformed into, or expressed in, material articles in process of con - struction. In our manual training department in charge of Mr. Charles A. Kepp, the boys are trained in the handling of tools, being given practical work in sloyd, joinery, wood - turning, mechanical drawing, cabinet making and house construction. It is the plan to give every boy entering the school at least the primary work in manual training, leaving the advanced work to be studied by those showing special interest and aptitude along mechanical lines. The shop is well equipped with wood-working machinery, the latest addition being a turning-lathe. The printing department, in charge of Mr. Harold Fenton, trains boys in type-setting, job-work, press-work, etc., in fact in all branches of the printers' trade, with the aim to make of a boy an all-round printer, ready upon graduation to take a position in an ordinary printing office. The office is called upon, under the direction of the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, to do printing for the various state institutions under its control. This work being of varied character, gives good and abundant practice </seg>
            <seg id="p010">540 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF to our boys in doing, in essence, commercial work. During the biennium just past the office did some three hundred and fifty-eight different jobs of a charge value of $4852.02. The office has added to its equipment during the two years a second Chandler &amp; Price job press, a 30-inch paper cutter and a steel imposing stone. In my last report I made recom - mendation that a linotype be installed to make the office equipment fully adequate to the demands for doing work and giving the boys a more nearly complete training to «nter and hold places in the modern printing establishment. I may say in this connection that a number of schools for the deaf in other states have linotypes in their printing offices, one, the New Jersey State School, having three. The department of gardening with the general care of the lawns and greenhouse is in charge of Mr. W. H. Chap - man. The institution property covers twenty-three acres, of which probably half is campus, the remainder being garden. The total value of the products of the garden and vineyard and orchard for the biennium was $1843.39. This includes the value of the hogs and chickens raised. Mr. Chapman is also in charge of the meat room and store room, from which are issued supplies upon requisition of the matron. The recent purchase by the board of an automobile truck gives greatly improved facilities for trans - porting supplies from the city. The classes in Domestic Art, under the instruction of Mrs. Edith Johnston, are given courses in sewing, dress - making, dress fitting and cutting, embroidery and fancy work. All the girls take these courses and they attain a high degree of skill in the work. There were 4386 articles made in this department by the girls during the biennium, including 366 articles for the Red Cross. Likewise the older girls before finishing school have a complete course under Mrs. Johnston in Domestic Sci - ence, equipping them for doing all kinds of plain and fancy cooking, thus fitting them to become efficient helpers in the home kitchens as well as in their own kitchens in after life. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 541 GRADUATION The completion of the above course of twelve grades earns for a pupil the school diploma of graduation. The following named pupils constituted the class graduating in June, 1917: Bernice Edna Alexander, Otoe County Edith May Anderson, Custer County Tena Bertha Anderson, Kearney County Albert Leon Beers, Thayer County Cecelia Anna Birk, Hall County Mary Ann Estes, Lancaster County Gertrude May Horn, Cedar County Mine Eline Jensen, Hamilton County Anna Hilda Larsen, Wayne County Grace Mabel Mason, Douglas County Harry William Stark, Douglas County Gwendoline Augusta Stoner, Gage County Hattie Dorothy Zitting, Keith County Of the above the following names returned to the school September, 1917, as post-graduates to further pre - pare themselves for passing the entrance examinations to Gallaudet College: Bernice Alexander, Edith Anderson, Tena Anderson, Bert Beers, Cecelia Birk, Mary Estes, Ger - trude Horn and Mine Jensen. Three of the number, namely, Edith Anderson, Cecelia Birk and Mine Jensen succeeded in passing the examinations, securing admission to the col - lege. At present the school is represented in the college by four of our graduates. THE SCHOOL LIBRARY It gives me pleasure to make acknowledgment in this report of the contributions to our library, made by the State Library Commission, through Miss Nellie Williams, Librarian for state institutions. During the biennium we have received 189 volumes, also regularly sixteen periodicals, the latter for the pupils' reading room. Both books and periodicals were well selected and have been read and </seg>
            <seg id="p012">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF greatly enjoyed by the pupils. Reading by the deaf makes tor education and culture, possible in greater relative degree than is the case with any other class. They hear, as it were, through their eyes, and thus gain much of current thought that otherwise would not come to their knowledge. The circulation records of the library show that 5351 books were taken out and read by the pupils during the past term of nine months. The placing of graded groups of books in the school rooms has greatly stimulated interest in the library on the part of both teachers and pupils. EXPENDITURES FOR THE BIENMl'M I would submit the following estimate of expenditures needed for general maintenance for the biennium begin - ning with April 1, 1919: The above estimate, totalling $152,000.00, compared with the appropriation for the current biennium, which was $117,900.00, shows an increase of about 30 per cent. I consider the increase justified and necessary in the light of the considerable deficiency in prospect, which I esti - mate will approximate $25,000.00, and the very probable increase in wages and salaries to be paid, in the cost of repairs and in the prices of provisions and materials to be purchased. In addition to the above, I would recommend the fol- lowing appropriations for extraordinary expenses. For — Furniture and Equipment: A 150 horse power boiler and stoker for heating, lighting and power plant, to complete present equipment $ 5,000.00 Salaries and wages $70,000.00 New equipment for trades and kitchen 2,000.0( Maintenance 80,000.0C </seg>
            <seg id="p013">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 543 A linotype for the printing depart - ment, with electric heater, RECOMMENDATIONS The last legislature made an appropriation of $6,000.00 for a new barn and garage and for grading grounds and laying walks. On account of the increase in cost of all kinds of buildings, the amount was found wholly inadequate even for the erection of the barn and garage. Hence, the amount appropriated remained unused. Appropriations are now asked for, of $10,000.00 for the barn and garage and of $4,000.00 for grading grounds and laying walks. CONCLUSION In closing I would express my appreciation of the co - operation extended to me by your Honorable Board, individ - ually and collectively ; also to express appreciation of the help and co-operation of the corps of teachers and officers in the school who have contributed so much and so unselfishly toward the success of the work being carried on in the school- Respectfully submitted, Omaha, Nebraska, November 30, 1918.
