Reports, 165-167.) In that order the subject matter involved herein was carefully discussed and the complaint dismissed. Under date of August 18, 1927, complainants filed motion requesting that the matter be reopened for the purpose of reargument. The motion was granted, but on request of complainants date for same was delayed. On February 18, 1928, the matter was reargued before the Com - mission, H. S. Colvin appearing for complainants and H. A. Mintz and E. C. Blnndell for defendants. In this reargument complainants stressed particularly the fact that Resolution No. 80 covering "brick rates in Nebraska specifically mentions j and uses the word "points" rather than "stations"; also, that the present arrangement is a viola - tion of the long and short haul clause. |Reference was also made to . the Equal Facilities Act.

Wylie, chairman of the Nebraska State Legislative Board of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen. It alleges that he is a citizen of Nebraska and that as chairman of the legislative board above mentioned, he has been authorized and directed to act for the locomotive firemen employed by defendant, who are affected by the matters complained of and that the defendant is a common carrier engaged in the transportation of passengers and property by railroad between points in Nebraska. The complaint then sets forth the following : "That at McCook the defendant a large part of the time requires the fireman on its passenger engines to throw- and handle </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION a large number of switches in taking said passenger engines from the roundhouse to the depot, and from the depot to the round - .house after the completion of a ran, 'and that the same require - ment is made by the defendant of the firemen at Omaha in taking passenger engines from the roundhouse to the depot and from the - depot to the roundhouse after the completion of a run, and in tak - ing switch engines from the roundhouse to the Douglas Street Yard and back again. "That said requirement by the defendant of its firemen is unsafe and dangerous to the public and defendant's employees, because: ' 1. When the fireman is switching only one man is left on the engine who cannot watch both sides to see that everything is in the- clear. ■■• 2. When the switch is on the opposite side of the engine from the engineer the fireman when on the ground throwing a switch cannot signal to the engineer. 3. Firemen are dressed for work on the engine in front of the fire door and their health is endangered when required to get off the engine in cold weather to throw switches when sweaty and unsuitably clothed for outside work." The complainant prays that a hearing may be held and that an order may be made commanding the defendant to cease and desist from requiring its firemen, to handle and throw switches as set out in the complaint. There is also prayer for general relief. • . ■ ■ ■ ■ i l The answer, among other matters, alleges that the Nebraska State Railway Commission has no jurisdioation under the constitution and laws of Nebraska, particularly under Sections 5521 and 5522, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, and that it is also precluded from exercis - ing jurisdiction over the subject matter by virtue of the Federal Rail - way Labor Act, being Chapter 8, Title 45, U. S. Code (1928 Supp. 275). Sections 5521 and 5522, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 read as follows: "The State Railway Commission shall have and exercise jurisdiction over the . service, facilities and equipment of all rail - roads in this state and shall, upon due notice and hearing, render judgment, orders, and decrees as to the efficiency, sufficiency and safety of the service, facilities or equipment furnished; and if any service, facilities or equipment is found inadequate, in - sufficient or unsafe, the State Railway Commission shall order such changes therein or additions thereto made as shall to the Commission seem necessary to render the same sufficient, effici - ent and safe. "The provisions of this act shall apply not only to those having business relations with the common carrier, but also the </seg>
            <seg id="p152">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT general public. This act shall not be construed as. a limitation upon the powers of the State Railway Commission which have heretofore been granted, but as supplemental thereto. It is further provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as giving the State Railway Commission jurisdiction or control of the relations between' the railway companies and their em - ployees and employees' orders, eithw contractual or otherwise." o ■ ■ ■' These sections have never been before the supreme court of this state. ' They were considered by the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion in Ford v. Union Stock Yards Co., 14 N. S. R. C. .'Reports, 144. The Commission said: \&lt; "The last provision of section 2 of the statute is purely negative. It is merely a limitation of the act by its own terms. It neither increases nor diminishes the power vested in the Com - mission by the constitution."- Our conclusion is that the State Railway • Commission was not deprived of jurisdiction by that statute.' The second ground of objection is that Congress has acted upon this subject to the exclusion of the states. A consideration of the authorities loads to the conclusion that such objection must be. sustained. The Railway Labor Act governs all interstate carriers in .their relations to the classes of employees covered by that act. The defend - ant company is an interstate carrier. The record affirmatively shows that a majority of the passenger trains having roundhouse service at WcCook are interstate. It also shows, that passenger trains oper - ated in and out of Omaha are, in part, interstate. When Congress legislates on a matter of interstate commerce, whatever power the states previously possessed thereover is superseded. In Simpson v. Shepard (Minnesota rate case) 230 U. S. 352, it is "The general principles governing the exercise of state authority when interstate commerce is affected are well estab - lished. The power of Congress to. regulate commerce among the several states is supreme and plenary. It is 'complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are . prescribed in the Constitution.' Gib - bons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat 1, 19C, 0 L. ed. 23, 70. The conviction of its necessity sprang from the disastrous experiences under the Confederation, when the states vied in discriminatory me - asures against each other. In order to end these evils, the grant in the constitution conferred upon Congress an authority at all times adequate to secure the freedom of interstate commercial </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ■ ■ intercourse from state control, and to provide effective reguiu - tion of that intercourse ag the national interest may demand. The words 'among the several states' j distinguish between the commerce which concerns more states than one, and that com - merce which is confined within one state and does not affect other states. 'The genius and character of the whole govern - ment,' said Chief Justice Marshall, 'seems to be, that Us action is to be applied to all the external concerns of the nation, and to those internal concerns which affect the states generally, but not to those which are completely within a particular state, which do not affect other states, and with which it is not neces - sary to interfere, for the purpose of executing some of the general powers of the government. The completely internal commerce of a state, then, may be considered as reserved for the state itself.' This reservation to the states manifestly is only of that authority which is consistent with, and not opposed to, the grant to Congress. There is no room in our scheme of government for the assertion of state power in hostility to the authorized ex - ercise of Federal power. The authority of Congress extends to . every part of interstate commerce, and j to every instrumentality or agency by which it is carried on; and the full control by Con - gress of the subjects committed to its' regulation is not to be denied or thwarted by the commingling! of interstate and intra - state operations. This is not to say that the nation may deal with the internal concerns of the state, as such, but that the execution by Congress of its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce is not limited by jthe fact that ihtrastato transactions may have become so interwoven therewith that the effective government of the former incidentally controls the latter. This conclusion necessarily results from the supremacy of the national power within its appointed sphere. (Cases Cited). "The grant in the Constitution of its! own force, that is, with - out action by Congress, established the iessential immunity of in - terstate commercial intercourse from the direct control of the states with respect to those subjects embraced within the grant " which are of such a nature as to demand that, if regulated at all, their regulation ■ should be prescribed by a single authority. ; It has repeatedly been declared by this court that as to those sub - jects which require a general system or uniformity of regulation, the power of Congress is exclusive. In |other matters, admitting of diversity of treatment according to the special requirements ' of local conditions, the states may act within their respective jurisdictions until Congress sees fit to act; and, when Congress does act, the exercise of its authority j overrides all conflicting state legislation."

            <seg id="p154">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT under the Railway Labor Act, it is the duty of all carriers, their officers, agents and employees, to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rales and working conditions, and to settle all disputes arising out of the ap - plication of such agreements or otherwise. It seems to be the purpose of the new act to make it the duty of both carriers and employees to settle their own relations, so far as possible, without public inter - vention. See American Labor Legislation Review 1926, Volume 1C, Page 140. Section .152 of the Act provides, in part, as follows: "First. Duty of carriers and employees to settle disputes. — It shall be the duty of all carriers, their officers, agents and employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working condi - tions, and to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the ap - plication of such agreements or otherwise, in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees The term "working conditions" covers the subject matter of the present complaint. See Decisions of United States Railway Labor Board, Volume 6 (1925), Page 273. The present act provides for the creation of several boards to settle disputes between the carriers, and their employees. While the procedure is voluntary, it is the duty of both parties to invoke it. Railway Labor Act, Section 152, paragraphs second .and fourth. If the powers of a mediation board are invoked and carried through, it results in an award which becomes the basis of a decree of the United States District Court, which, subject to appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, is binding upon all parties. Section 159, paragraph second, provides as follows: "An award acknowledged and filed as herein provided shall be conclusive on the parties as to the merits and facts of the controversy submitted to arbitration, and. unless, within ten days after the filing of the award, a petition to impeach the award, on the grounds hereinafter set forth, shall be filed in the clerk's office of the court in which the award has been filed, the court shall enter judgment on the award, which judgment shall be final and conclusive on the parties." Other paragraphs of Section 159 provide for methods of impeach - ing the award and for appeals to the circuit court of appeals. The determination of the circuit court of appeals is final. The final judgment of the district court, or if the case be appealed, the judgment of the circuit court of appeals, when certified to the district court, may be enforced by injunction. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In Brotherhood of Railroad and Steam Ship Clerks etc., v. Texas &amp; N. 0. R, Co., 24 Fed. (2d) 426, it -was held, on complaint of the brotherhood, that the railroad company was guilty of a contempt of an order of injunction restraining the defendant, its servants, etc., from, seeking to influence the selection of representatives of the brother - hood m an arbitration of a labor dispute. The syllabus of the case is, m part, as follows: "Railway Labor Act, Chapter 2, Par. 3 (45 USCA Chapter 152), prodding for designation of representatives by railroads and employees for purpose of settling labor disputes without interference, influence, or coercion exercised by either party over self-organization or designation of representatives by the other, held valid." "Railway Labor Act, Chapter 2, Par. 3 (45 USCA Chapter 152), providing for selection of representatives by railroad and employees for purpose of settling labor disputes without inter - ference, influence, or coercion by either party, must be liberally construed and applied, so as to give effect to paramount public convenience subserved thereby." "Railroad, promoting organization of employees' association hostile to organized labor unions and recognizing it as repre - sentative of employees, held to have violated injunction restrain - ing it from violating Railway Labor. Act, Chapter 2, par. 3 (45 USCA Chapter 152), providing for selection of representatives for settlement of labor disputes without interference, influence or coercion." The court also said m its opinion: "Nor can there longer be any doubt that Congress had the Dower to, and that it must, m the interest of public peace and safety, make certain, m the first step m negotiations between the railroad employer and employee (who have long since come to be recognized, as to this instrument of interstate commerce m their hands, not as private persons having the right to ex - ercise 'liberty through sheer antipathy,' but as trustees of the public), that representatives of the railroad companies should not • meet representatives of the employees, nominally elected by them,, but m fact under the influence and control of the railroad com - panies. I therefore easily find that the legislation m question was not only within the power of Congress to enact, but that it should be liberally construed and applied, so as to give effect to the paramount public convenience subserved by it." The same case was again before the! court and was reported in -25 Fed. (2d) Page 876, where the injunction was treated as m full force. The provisions of . the statute were also sustained m Atchison.

            <seg id="p156">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT injunction was recognized as the proper remedy, as it is made in - cumbent upon the parties to use every endeavor to settle any ques - tion as to working conditions, and as it is niade their duty to invoke arbitration under the provisions of the statute, and as such arbitra - tion may result in a decree binding upon all parties, the statute must be regarded us an occupation of the field by Congress under the com - merce clause of the federal constitution. That the statute should be broadly interpreted as an occupation of the field is indicated by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. In Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Washington, 222 TJ. S. 370, it was held that Congress had so acted upon the subject of the hours of labor of interstate railroad employees by enacting the Hours of Service Act as to preclude a state, during the period between the date of that act and the time when, by its express terms, it should go into effect, from making or enforcing as to such employees, the local regulation limiting hours of labor. In the case just cited it was contended that as the federal act did not go into effect until a year after its passage, it was of no force or effect during that interim. In answer to that contention the court said: "But we are of opinion that this view is not compatible with the paramount authority of Congress over interstate com - merce. It is elementary, and such is the doctrine announced by the cases to which the court below referred, that the right of a state to apply its police power for the purpose of regulating interstate commerce, in a case like this, exists only from the silence of Congress on the subject, and ceases when Congress acts on the subject, or manifests its purpose to call into play its exclusive powers. This being the conceded premise upon which alone the state law could have been made applicable, it results that as the enactment by Congress of the law in question was an assertion of its power, by the fact alone of such mani - festation that subject was at once removed from the sphere of the operation of the authority of the state. To admit the fund - amental principle and yet to reason that because Congress chose to make its prohibitions take effect only after a year, the matter with which Congress dealt remained subject to state power, is to cause the act of Congress to destroy itself ; that is, to give effect to the will of Congress as embodied in ' the postponing provision for the purpose of overriding and rendering ineffect - ive the expression of the will of Congress to bring the subject within its control, — a manifestation arising from the mere fact of the enactment of the statute." The principle of the decision in the Washington case, was re - cognized and re-affirmed in Erie R. Co. v. N. Y., 233 U. S. 685. </seg>

            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION COMMISSIONER MILLER PRESIDING. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION This matter arises upon the complaint of the Macy Investment Company of Macy, who allege that the telephone rates now charged by defendant company for Maey subscribers and the limited service received therefor is unjust and unreasonable. ! ... -I •.;;•■ ■ I The original complaint by Macy Investment Company was later supplemented by a request from the other subscribers involved, who sought to be made a party to the complaint. The Northeastern Telephone Company of Walthill, defendant herein, owns and operates a telephone system in and adjacent to Walt - hill, including a line from the Walthill switchboard to Macy, over which arc served five Macy subscribers. Thej present practice of the company with respect to rates and service provides for a charge of $3.25 for wall type party business phone and $1.75 per month for wall type party residence telephone with a discount allowed of 25 cents per month if payment is made in advance on or before the 15th of the current month billed. An extra charge of 25 cents per month is made for desk phones. For the above rate the Macy subscribers are re - stricted to service to only the five telephones in Macy. All subscribers receive five-party service, all of them being served on the Walthill line No. 20. For an additional rate per phone of $1.50 for residence and $3.00 for business subscribers Walthill subscribers may be reached without further charge, otherwise to call Walthill subscribers, a toll charge is assessed at the rate of 20c person to person, and 10c station to station. Furthermore, subscribers of. the Northeastern Telephone Company at Walthill do not have the privilege of talking to the five subscribers above mentioned at Macy, without payment of the above toll charges. The above rates have originated from an order by the Commission in 1909, Special Order No. 446, wherein the government Indian agency at Macyi made a special request of defendant company for a flat rate for service to Walthill, since at that time no connections were obtain - able except a grounded trunk line from Walthill to a telephone booth in Macy. Following considerable correspondence with the Commission it was agreed between the company and the) subscriber that for an additional $3.00 per month to the regular farm rate Walthill service would be furnished. Thereafter, other subscribers were added. There appears to be no authorization in the Commission's files for the $1.50 additional rates for residence or farm phones. In defendant's most recent application for increase in rates authority was granted to increase all rates at Winnebago, Rosalie and </seg>
            <seg id="p160">TWENTY- SECOND ANNUAL REPORT alSi T 1 . th f timC there was no mention made of the situation at Mac j. I his leaves some question as to whether or not the Maey rates have had Commission approval. The manager for the company contends that Maey rates were automatically raised with the other exchange rates. ,1, J el ' phonc ser T viee was «rst furnished to the Maey subscribers by the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, approximately eleven years ago Later the Northwestern Bell telephone company withdrew from tie territory and the subscribers were served through the Walthill ex - change. The first service from Walthill to Maey was furnished by way of installation of a long distance telephone booth where subscribers nigh place calls at the regular toll rate. Later, demand arose for telephones and subscribers were added from time to time and others moved from the territory until at the present time, as above stated, only five subscribers receive service over the Maey lines. The most sub- ZuinmleT 6 " »"&gt;" °" e time at % ™,ld not exceed The telephone line over which the Maey subscribers are served is of grounded type and is attached to farm line poles for. a distance of approximately s,x and one-half miles. The remaining distance, or three miles is covered by pole line constructed especially for the bene - tit of the Maey subscribers. Quoting from the testimony of the man - ager of the company the equipment is described as follows- "It is a grounded circuit and parallels a number of farm, lines. They actually get cross-talk off of them. At times it is worse than others'and there isn t any remedy outside of making the line metallic and the business would not warrant that." This type of construction and service does not in the opinion of the Commission measure up to standard toll ser - vice which would justify standard toll rates. The Maey subscribers are paying a toll rate for service over a circuit which now has attached five subscribers There would be no privacy in the toll conversation m addition to the inconvenience experienced on account of cross-talk. The question before the Commission is to: determine whether or not the rates now charged by the defendant company herein are equitable and just as compared with the general rate structure of the defendant company. The Commission observes that the rate ner subscriber charged for the five subscribers in Maey which do^s not give hem the privilege of placing a call to any one except their four neighbors without the assessment of additional toll charge is the same as is charged the Walthill subscribers of defendant company who re - ceive individual line service and. have the privilege of talking without additional charge to approximately 234 subscribers. The Commission finds also that the toll charges are assessed at the regular toll rates between Maey and Walthill over a grounded party line. It is also observed that the defendant company serves farm line subscribers who receive service through the Walthill exchange to all Walthill sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION scribers at a rate of $5.25 per quarter less 75c if paid within the iirst month of the quarter. Defendant company complained of the extremely high maintenance expense of the Macy line on account of the very bad roads and its being: inaccessible in the winter time. However, the Commission is mindful of the fact that the farm lines which it maintains for the rates above quoted cover exactly the same territory as the Macy line to within three miles of Macy and defendant testified that the road be - tween the three-mile point and Macy was a well-graded highway. The Commission does not believe therefore, that the maintenance cost of the Macy line is. enough higher than the company's other farm lines to justify any extra charge. The defendant points out that its subscribers in Macy have re - ceived a special service. • This testimony seems tb be corroborated by the complainants. The special service referred to is furnished by re - stricting the subscribers on the line to the residents of Macy, which have never exceeded eight in number and at the present time five. The prospects are that there will probably not be an excess of five sub - scribers for sometime. Since there is no switchboard at Macy and due to the fact that the Macy subscribers are in such close Droximity to the rural sub - scribers of the Walthill exchange the Commission does not consider the Macy subscribers in a separate exchange area. For this reason and reasons above set forth, the Commission finds no justification for any toll charge between Walthill and Macy. The usual practice approved by the Commission in instances of this kind is to establish a mileage rate in addition to the regular rate to compensate the company for additional investment and expenses. In this case it might be assumed that nine and one-half miles of single wire and three miles of pole line are involved. The Commission's engineering department has estimated that a liberal valuation on this property involved would not exceed $600. Without making an allow - ance for any material increase in number of subscribers which might be served from Macy, the Commission finds that a mileage rate of $1.50 per month in addition to the regular farm and business rate charged to the farm line and business subscribers of j$3.00 and $1.50, respec - tively, would fully compensate applicant for the service rendered.

COMMISSIONER RANDALL PRESIDING. BY THE COMMISSION: The complaint in this proceeding was filed by twenty-two land owners of Dawson County, Nebraska. It sets forth that the defendant is a corporation operating an irrigation canal in that county, having an appropriation specifically described, from the north bank of the Platte River, with priority dated September, 1894, for two hundred and forty cubic feet of water per second, such water to be applied for the ir - rigation of a certain tract of land under its appropriation, which tract includes the lands of the complainants, amounting to three thousand two hundred and sixty acres, which are particularly described. It. is averred that the defendant has failed and neglected to construct and complete its irrigation canal so as to deliver water for purposes of irri - gation to the lands of the complainants, but has a small shallow ditch, obstructed with weeds and brush, which is incapable of conducting water thereto; that the complainants have requested the defendant to construct its canal so as to deliver water to their lands and have sought to purchase permanent water rights: but that the defendant has failed to construct and care for its canal so as to deliver water for purposes of irrigation to their lands; that defendant has refused to sell permanent water rights to complainants and has declined to make contracts with them for the regular and legal delivery of water, and has refused to sell water to complainants except by the season and then only during such seasons when, because of more abundant rainfall, the defendant could deliver water to the plaintiffs through its incompleted and neglected canal. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION It is alleged that the defendant has failed to construct laterals to conduct water from its main canal to complainants' lands and that they have been compelled, each for himself, to construct laterals to conduct such water as was furnished by defendant to their lands; that the defendant has failed and refused to construct lateral headgates, measuring devices and checks, with which to measure the water from its main canal to complainants' lands; by reason of which, great con - fusion and contention have been created among the complainants and others concerning the proper division of water available for irrigation among them. The prayer of the complaint is, in part, as follows: that "an order issue commanding the said defendant, Gothenburg Light and Power Company, to clean out, repair and construct its said canal so as to furnish water to the lands of the plaintiffs, upon the payment thereof by the plaintiffs to the said defendant of a reasonable sum for the use of such water. That they be further required to construct lateral headgates, measuring de - vices and checks so as to measure to the plaintiffs herein, the amount of water to which they are entitled, and for such other and further orders in the premises as may be just and proper, and that the defendant pay the costs of this hearing." •"...■ ■ . ■ ■ I The defendant, in its amended answer, admits that it owns and operates an irrigation canal in Dawson County, east from its lake at Gothenburg; that the appropriation of water for use in said canal 13 from the north bank of the Plat'te River and that the appropriation was made in 1894. It alleges that the irrigation appropriation was made and said canal is operated forholders of permanent water rights under said canal and that complainants are not the holders of permanent water rights and, under the law, have no legal [right to demand of the defendant water to irrigate any lands owned by them. The defendant also denies, for want of information, that the complainants own the respective tracts of land described in the complaint. The defendant admits that on certain occasions the complainants have bought water by the acre and placed the same on the lands claimed to be owned by them, and that defendant has furnished water to the complainants by the acre when the holders of permanent water rights have been served with such water as was required. The defendant also alleges that the complainants are barred from demanding relief by the statute of limita - tions for the reason that more. than ten years ihave elapsed since the order and the allowance of the defendants appropriation of water and no stens have been taken by complainants to obtain permanent water rights so as to be in a position to demand water of the defendant. The defendant also denies the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission to grant the relief prayed for by plaintiffs, unless and until the plain - tiffs establish that they are owners of permanent water rights. There is also a general denial of all allegations, of the complaint, not admitted. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT TIig reply admits that the complainants have not purchased per - manent water rights and alleges the reasons therefor to be that the defendant has never completed its canal so as to irrigate their lands, and has never been able to deliver perpetual water to their lands, and has only delivered water thereto when it could do so under peculiar conditions existing at the time water was delivered, and that the de - fendant has refused to sell to the complainants permanent water rights for their lands. It alleges that if the defendant is not required to furnish them water, they will be without an appropriation of water to irrigate their lands, as there is no water in the Platte River that can be appropriated by complainants for that purpose; that since September 22, 1894, being the date of the priority of the defendant's application to irrigate complainants' lands, the defendant has held exclusive right to irrigate such lands ; that complainants have relied on defendant's assumption of such right and privilege and have made no attempt to irrigate their lands from other ditches or other sources; that now to permit the defendant to repudiate its obligations so as to irrigate com - plainants' lands, would cause complainants irreparable damage and injury and that defendant is thereby estopped. There is also a general denial of all unadmitted allegations of the answer. . At the opening of the hearing and prior to the introduction of testimony, the defendant filed specific objections to the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission. Such objections are as follows: "1. Plaintiffs plead they are without permanent water rights; and for that reason plaintiffs have made no appropriation of water, and are not entitled to any order by this Commission in reference to the canal of defendant. "2. Without a right in plaintiffs to demand water for irrigation of certain specified lands, which amounts to an appropriation of water for such lands, plaintiffs are not authorized by law to seek the aid of this Commission to force compliance with any order the Commission may make. "3. The appropriation by defendant of water was to irrigate certain described tracts of land; but that appropriation did not give any land owner the right to water, • unless and until such land owner purchased the right to use water on certain specified lands; nor did the appropriation by defendant give to defendant the right to apply water so appropriated to the lands described in the appropriation from the source of supply. "4. The rights of defendant to the appropriation were fixed by the State Engineer and State Board of Irrigation as of date September 1, 1903, and more than ten years having elapsed since said date all rights, if any, posessed by plaintiffs, sire now barred by the statute of limitations. </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "5. The Commission was created under an act giving it juris - diction of common carriers, and the act declaring irrigation works common carriers having been repealed, no authority is vested m this Commission to hear and j determine the matters involved herein." Ownership of the lands by complainants, although denied m the answer, was not contested.. Under stipulations entered into at the heiiringr, it became unnecessary to do more than offer formal proof. This disposes of that portion of the record referring to ownership. The complainants own the respective tracts of land as alleged. It appears that the first appropriation was effected by posting, at the point of diversion, a notice thereof, on September 10, 1891. Notice of the second appropriation was posted at the point of diversion on the 22nd day of September, 1894. Copies of both notices were duly filed m the office of the County Clerk of Lincoln County. There was also a third appropriation, with which we are not concerned. All of these appropriations were made by the original company, The Goth-' enburg Power &amp; Irrigation Co., from which, by mesne conveyances, title has been received by the defendant. A claim affidavit was filed m the office of the State Board of Irrigation, July 5, 1895. Hearings were held before the board and findings were made by the state engine - er, secretary of the board, March 9, 1900. Later, a contest was in - stituted and the findings of the state engineer were modified on December 2, 1901. The first appropriation was for two hundred cubic feet of water) per second, all of which might be used for power, but not to exceed seventy cubic feet thereof might be used for irriga - tion. If part were used for irrigation, the portion used for power should be correspondingly reduced. The amount of the second ap - propriation, which was all to be used for irrigation, was not to exceed two hundred forty cubic feet per second, . the appropriation being limited to one-seventieth of one cubic foot per second of time for each acre irrigated. The order of the State Board of Irrigation required the irrigation works to be completed by September 1, 1903. ' The only appropriation mentioned m the complaint is I that of September 22, 1894, and is for two hundred forty cubic feet per second as above noted. It will be spoken of herein as "the appropriation", as under the pleadings and evidence, we are not concerned with the first appropria - tion and it is only referred to m order to avoid confusion. It appears that all of the two hundred, cubic feet, under tlie first appropriation, is now .employed for the production of power. The power station is located near Lake Helen at Gothenburg, which is about ten miles below the intake. There is no irrigation above Lake Helen. All of the irrigating is done with water that passes through Lake Helen, or Lake Gothen - burg: as it is sometimes called j m the record, through the canal which extends from Lake Helen to Lake Peden, a distance of about seventeen and one-half miles. From Lake Peden there is a smaller canal run - ning east, being the one which is chiefly complained of m the present </seg>
            <seg id="p168">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT proceedings. Any surplus water remaining in the ditch finds its way into Buffalo Creek and eventually flows back into the jPlatte River. The appropriation of 1894 was for two hundred forty cubic feet per second, which was all to be applied to irrigation, and would supply 16,800 acres of land. All of the lands described in the petition are within the tract covered by the appropriation, although it appears that some of the parcels cannot be entirely irrigated. The present flow of water through the canal, at or near the outlet of Lake Helen, appears to be one hundred ninety cubic feet per second, or sufficient to supply 13,300 acres. During the years 1927 and 1928 about 10,000 acres were irrigated annually. The land irrigated in 1928 was not identical with that irrigated in 1927. Some that was supplied with water in 1927 did not receive water in 1928, and vice versa, but the total for each of the two years was approximately the same. Included in the 10,000 acres is a portion, the exact acreage not being shown, of the lands described in the complaint, which have been receiving water during part of the time, particularly in the fall of the year. As the complainants own only 3,260 acres of land, a portion of which is not irrigable, and offered to take permanent water rights for but 2,000 acres, it is obvious that if the defendant should supply water for' all of the land it is now desired to irrigate, hot more than 12,000 acres in all would receive the service. It is probable that it would be con - siderably less than 12,000 acres. With an appropriation sufficient for 16,800 acres and with one hundred ninety cubic feet per second flowing out of Lake Helen, which is sufficient to irrigate 13,300 acres, we have no difficulty in finding that there should be from the appro - priation of record ample water to irrigate all of the land, including that of the complainants for which irrigation is now desired. The evidence establishes the fact that irrigation is necessary to successful farming in the area covered by the appropriation. The Commission also takes judicial notice of the fact. There being abundant water to supply the complainants, as well as those concededly entitled to it and the necessity for irrigation being established, we now come to the controversy as to the right of the complainants to demand irrigation service. Jurisdictional questions are ordinarily first considered, but in this instance it will be more con - venient first to consider substantive rights. The first phase of the subject requiring attention is the nature of an appropriation for irrigation under the law of the state. The earliest legislation was the act. of 1877 (Laws of 1877, Pg. 168) by which it was provided that corporations, organized under the laws of this state, for the purpose of operating canals for irrigation or for power purposes, "might acquire a right of way upon or over any lands necessary to the construction of such canals, including dams, reser - voirs, and all necessary adjuncts to such canals, under the power of </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION eminent domain. Canals constructed for such purposes were declared - to be vorks of internal improvement and all aws applicable to such works were declared to be applicable to sue! 1 canals. This was in accord with the general rule that irrigation w &gt;rks are public in their nature.' Wiel, Water Rights in Western States, Section 1262, Volume 2, Page 1161. Sherman County I. W. P. &amp; I. Go. v. Drake, 65 Neb. 699. Meng v. Coffee, 67 Neb. 500. Kirk v. State Board of Irrigation, 90 Neb. 627. Crawford Co. v. Hathaway, 67 iJTeb. 325. Sammons v. Kearney Power &amp; Irrigation Co., 77 Neb.- 580. Farmers &amp; Merchants Irrigation Company v. Brumbaugh, 81 Neb. 641. The Act of 1889 (Laws of 1889, Chapter 68, Article 2, Section 9) declares irrigation canals to be works of internal improvement, as also do the Act of 1895 (Laws of 1895, Chapter 69, Section 48) and the Act of 1919 (Laws of 1919, Chapter! 190, Article V, Division 3, Section 1.) The Constitution, Article XV, Sections 4-7, declares the necessity for water for domestic use and for irrigation purposes to be a natural want and the use of the water oi! every natural stream is therein dedicated to the people of the state for beneficial purposes. It is provided that the right to divert, under, appijopriation, water of every such stream shall not be denied, except as demanded by the public interest. The rights of the different classes of appropriates are fixed as to priority and the use of water for power purposes is declared to the public. Under the Act of 1919 the water of ev ry natural stream not already appropriated, was declared to be the property of the public. In 1911 (Laws of 1911, Chapter 157) irrigation works were declared to be common carriers and that is still the law of this state. The history of legislation on this subject is succinctly described in Farmers Canal Company v. Frank, 72 Neb. 136, where it is said (Pg. 145): "The first question which it is necessary to determine under these issues, is as to the status of the Farmers Canal Company and Roberts Walker with reference to the adjudication of priority of appropriation made by the state board of irrigation on the 9th day of January, 1897. This will involve a construction of certain sections of the act .of 1895, found in sections 1-64, article Tt, Chapter 93a, Compiled Statutes (Annotated Statutes, 6755 - 6886), being the general law relating to irrigation, and, in order to have a proper consideration of the meaning and intent of the . legislature in the enactment of such provisions, it will be necess - - n'ry to consider the whole course of legislation in this state upon this subject, and the construction given to similar statutory and constitutional provisions by the courts of other states and ter - ritories. . On February 19, 1877, an act was approved providing for the organization of corporations for the purpose of con - ■ "■■■'■ •':'■'• •■ ■ ' . </seg>
            <seg id="p170">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT structing and operating irrigation canals, and giving such cor - porations the necessary powers to carry out the purpose of their organization. Laws 1877, p. 168. In 1889 another irrigation law was passed, repealing the law of 1877,' but covering the subject more extensively and supplying the deficiencies which experience had shown to exist in the operation of the former law. Laws 1889, Ch. 68. It is a matter of public knowledge that, after the passage of these acts, many irrigation enterprises were com - menced in the western part of. the state, both by private in - dividuals and corporations. These interests became so extensive, and the subject of irrigation of such economic importance, that, in 1895, new and comprehensive laws were enacted covering the entire subject of the application of the waters of the. state by private individuals and corporations to a beneficial use, creating a complete and harmonious system for the determination of the respective rights of persons interested, and providing an orderly method of administration. . At the time of the passage of the act of 1895 many persons and corporations had acquired vested rights in the appropriation of waten for irrigation purposes. It was not the intention of the legislature to create confusion and stir up strife, controversy and litigation over the water rights theretofore acquired, but it is manifest from a consideration of the law of 1895, that, among the main inducements to its passage, were the features requiring the adjudication of the priorities of appropriation upon all of the streams of the state up to the time of the passage of the act, and the creation of a state board of irrigation whose records would evidence the priorities of title to the appropriation of water in such a public manner that no one might be misled. Publicity of right and stability of title were matters which the legislature evidently intended to establish so far as lay within its power, and the provisions of the law under consideration seem admirably fitted to accomplish this object." All of the statutes, including those now in force provide for con - demnation of land for right-of-way purposes which establish the public character of irrigation works. Clark v. .Cambridge &amp; Arapahoe I. &amp; I. Co., 45 Neb. 798. Paxton &amp; Hershey Irrigating Co. v. Farmers &amp; Merchants Irrigation Co., 45 Neb. 884. Such works are also ex - empted from taxation. Comp. Stat. 1922, Sec. 8472. The public character of irrigation works being established it fol - lows, as with other public utilities, that there must be no discrimination among their patrons. In Sammons v. Kearney Power &amp; Irrigation Co., 77 Neb. 580, it is said (Pg. 589) : "In the case at bar we are dealing with an irrigation com - pany — a quasi public corporation. It also is a governmental agency, but its main purpose is the administration of a public utility. To the extent of its capacity it is bound to furnish water </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION from its canal to persons desiring to use it on equal terms and without discrimination. In this respect it stands on the same footing as a railroad company. ' Neither has the right or power to place itself in a position where it cannot serve every person on equal terms ■ with every other person. Neither has the right or the power to bind itself by contract which, if enforced, would render it unableto serve the public on those terms or carry out its main purpose." --■■■ ■ ■--'.:-. See also Farmers &amp; Merchants Irrigation Co. v. Brumbaugh, supra. Southside Irrigation Co. v. Brooks, 102 Neb. 57. As the right to water may not be dissociated from the land, Fanners Canal Company v. Frank, supra., it is conclusive that there can not, under the law, be any preference given to one riser over another. The record shows that those who hold i permanent water rights are given preference in the supply of water Mr. James R. Jaquet, resident manager of the defendant, testified, '(Record Volume 2, Page 66); "Q. Now then in serving that class of users, do you on the • yearly basis not serve permanent jwater rights first? A. Yes sir. Q. And only deliver water to them when the permanent water rights are not using it? A. Yes sir. . Q. You rent sometimes, ' additional water on a yearly basis to the owners of permanent water rights do you not? A. We make no distinction whether he has permanent water right or not, when it comes to buying yearly water. Q. But you serve the permanent water, rights first? A. We are obliged to.'- Q. That is your understanding of the law? A. Yes sir. Q. That the man with the permanent water right has the prior . right? A. Yes sir. Q. And you must serve him first? A. Yes sir." . Other portions of the record show the same facts. It is provided by statute, Section 8473, ; Compiled Statutes 1922, that a contract conveying the right to use [ water from a ditch or canal, is entitled to record in the same manner as a deed for real estate. While the subject is not entirely clear, we hold that where an irrigation company has diverted water from a public stream for the benefit of lands, specifically described in the appropriation, and </seg>
            <seg id="p172">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT has sold permanent water rights covering a large portion of such lands, it cannot now arbitrarily refuse to sell permanent water rights to others having land within the same appropriation, while at the same time holding out the purchase of water rights as a condition precedent to the securing of service, there being sufficient water to supply such lands. If however the company elects to supply users, not now having permanent water rights, upon an annual rental basis, the Commission feels that it should be allowed to do so, in which case the rates will be so fixed as to be' adapted to the different classes of users and so that no inequality will result. We now come to the contention as to where the water is to be delivered. Complainants take the position that it is the duty of the company to deliver water to them at the borders of their respective lands and not require the complainants to construct their own laterals as they have heretofore had to do. The general rule as to all public utilities is that they must provide the necessary facilities for the performance of service. This is true of irrigation companies. Wiel: Water Rights in the Western States, Volume 2, Section 1282. What is the service an irrigation company undertakes: Section 8418, Compiled Statutes for 1922 provides: "8418. Every person managing, owning or controlling any irrigation works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except irrigation districts, shall keep its headgates,. diversion dams, canals and laterals in reasonable and proper repair for the delivery and diversion of water to the appropriators under its canal, and the regulation thereof shall be under the control, and direction of the State Railway Commission." Delivery "to the appropriators," no place being mentioned, indi - cates tlat the water is to be delivered at a location wheife they can immediately use it. The requirement that a company shall keep its laterals in repair shows that it is not intended that delivery shall be made at the outlets from the main canal. The broad meaning that is given to the term canal (Section .8412) further implies that the water is to be conveyed to the border of the land to be irrigated. Sections 8430, 8431 and 8438 also indicate the same. See also Niday v. Barker (Idaho) 101 Pac. 254, Sisk v. Gravity Canal Co., 113 South - western Reporter 195. Farnham Water &amp; Water Right, Volume 3, Page 1920. Houston R. C. Co. v. Kopke (La.) 31 So. 156. This subject has been before the supreme court of Nebraska in cases involving irrigation districts. State v. Qering Irrigation Dis - trict, 109 Neb. 642. In that case it is said: "Is the lateral a part of the irrigation works of the district, and does the fact that the district has never constructed a lateral </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION excuse its failure to furnish water to residents? Section 2865, Comp. St. 1922, makes it the duty of the directors of irrigation districts 'to make all necessary arrangements for right of way for laterals from the main canal to j each tract of land subject to assessment, and when necessary the board shall exercise its rights of eminent domain to procure right of way for the laterals and shall make such rules m regard to the payment for such right of way as may be just and ! equitable.' This evidently contemplates that the district shall procure the right of way for the necessary laterals 'to each tract; of land subject to assess - ment.' That the district has not heretofore furnished water except at head gates upon its main canal is no defense. The fact that it has neglected a plain duty for many years is no reason why it should continue to neglect it. That the plan of the district did not contemplate the construction of laterals is also no defense. If the plan was I defective and failed to ac - complish the statutory duty of the district to furnish water to each landowner m the district, m section 2866 it is provided: The board, its agents and employees shall have the right to enter upon any land within the district, to make surveys, and may locate the line of any canal or canals and the necessary 1 branches.' This language presumes the necessity of surveys and the location of canals and necessary branches after the for - mation of the district, and assumes! that 'branches' or laterals may be necessary to carry out the purpose of the organization. In such case there must be laterals to carry the water to the ultimate user. Such laterals are necessary portions of the irrigation works and should be provided, maintained and supervised by the district, so that a) just apportionment of the water may be supplied to each landowner therein. It would be manifestly unjust and unfair to -assess a landowner whose pro - perty is situated several miles from the main canal without pro - viding him reasonable facilities to ! obtain the water for the furnishing of which he is taxed. To; sustain the position of the respondents would be to hold that the owners of land adjacent to the main canal are entitled to receive water without further initial outlay, while at the same time other landowners, who are also taxed according to valuation, shall be compelled to build and maintain expensive works and furnish supervision for such works m order to obtain that which is supplied without such expense to others who have no {greater right. This would be clearly inequitable, unfair and unjust, and such construction of the statute ought not to be adopted. Of course, landowners may provide their own laterals if they desire, but where there is more than one water-user taking water from the same lateral, -and any dispute arises between the users, the district board should regulate the supply, as m the case of other users of water. Water is as essential to successful and profitable agri- </seg>

The statute, both by express direction and by implication, provides that all powers reasonably necessary to carry into effect the object and purpose of the organization are possessed by the board of directors. "That the petition does not show that the district has suf - ficient funds on hand which can be utilized for the purpose of repairing the lateral is not a sufficient defense under the circum - stances provided in this case." ' The statute as to irrigation districts does not expressly provide where the delivery shall be made, as will be observed from, the fore - going quotation. The general reasons assigned by the court are as applicable to irrigation companies as to irrigation districts and the language of the statutes as to irrigation companies seems to be as strong, although not the same .verbiage, as that used in reference to irrigation districts. If the public character of the water ceased at the headgates of the laterals, then we should have the power of eminent domain exercised to build laterals for private use. It is agreed by the defendant that under Section 8454, Compiled Statutes of 1922, the laterals must be constructed by the water users. A section almost identical in form and meaning with Section 81454, appeared in the Revised Statutes of 1913 as Section 3431. The latter was before the court in Vetter v. Broadhearst, 100 Neb. 356. 9 A. L. R. 578. While the section was not condemned in toto, it was held as being for a private purpose and invalid in so far as it applied to that case. Section 8454 refers to a specific condition which does not obtain as to any of the complainants. ■ The language of Section 8477, Comp. Statutes 1922, which de - clares irrigation works to be common carriers, also provides that the owner or operator of any such works, except irrigation districts, shall deliver all water legally appropriated "to the parties entitled thereto." As no other place is specified, the conclusion seems irresistible that it must be delivered at the lands owned by the respective parties. It is suggested that the company has not the means to, finance the improvements and repairs prayed for in the complaint. There are two answers to the contention. It is the duty of a public service company to secure necessary capital to perform the service which it undertakes. The business of an irrigation company is transporta - tion of water and it must secure the capital for the facilities neces - sary for the performance of that service.

            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Further, the complainants are ready to take permanent water rights covering 1,000 or even 2,000 acres at' $25.00 per acre. The only actual evidence before the Commission as [to the expense of the pro - posed improvements and repairs is that they would cost about $25,000 if one thousand acres were to be added. There is some evidence, of hearsay character, indicating that it might take as much as $50,000, but from the actual evidence adduced in this j record, it would not much exceed $25,000. The actual cost will, of course, vary with the number of acres added and their location. The fact that the defendant may not have the ready means at hand therefor does not relieve it of its obligation to supply the necessary facilities. It has refused to sell Avater rights at any price and there is noj showing that it has made any attempt to raise money either by the sale of stock or by borrow - ing, both of which it has the right to do upon proper showing to this Commission. As to the offer of the complainants to purchase water rights, it is suggested by defendant that the complainants have not designated the particular lands they desire to irrigate and that they have made no specific tender of money. The landowners dealt through a committee with the officers of the company. The three composing the committee appear, by the record, to be men of responsibility. There seems to have been no objection whatever at the time on the part of the company that they did not designate particular lands. No actual tender of the money was necessary because the defendant, by the officers, stated unequi - vocally that it would not sell-water rights. Under such circumstances, tender was unnecessary. A formal tender of money is never required where it is disclosed that if it had been; made it would have been fruitless. Graham v. Frazier, 49 Neb. 90. Lapham v. Bossemeyer Bros., 5 Neb. Unof. 343. Unless the contention of the defendant that the complainants have in some way lost their rights is correct, they are clearly entitled to an order in their favor in this case. The defendant contends that the complainants have lost whatever rights they may have had, first, by forfeiture and, second, by operation of| the statute of limitations. The first seems to be based on the idea that failure to take water during the time that has passed since the! appropriation, and failure to complete the works by the time set by jthe order of the Board of Irrigation, have wrought a forfeiture. The first answer is that the defendant is claiming all of the water under its appropriations. It cannot, of course, claim all the water and at the same time assert that the complainants have lost their rights by forfeiture. Dundyi County Irrigation- Co. v. Morris, 107 .Neb. 64.

That ■was the amount that was taken last season at or just below the outlet of Lake Helen. Complainants are clamoring for service, and all that is necessary to give it to them is to put the irrigation works in proper order. The real purpose of irrigation is to apply water to a beneficial use. It would be strange, indeed, if a landowner within the appropria - tion could be deprived of his rights by a forfeiture caused by the failure of the irrigation company to serve him. The real answers to the objection are, however,- that no forfeiture has been declared; and that this Commission has no power to declare one. It will be time enough to consider forfeiture when some proceeding to that end has been had under Compiled Statutes of 1922, Sec. 8432. Sherman County Irr. AV. &amp; I. Co. v. Drake, 65 Neb. 699. The other claim concerning forfeiture is that as the irrigation, works were not completed by September 1^ 1903, as provided by the order of the State Board, the complainants are without rights. The company is not in a position to make such a claim and as the appropria - tion was complete before the Act of 1895 ; was passed, there was no power on the part of the State Board to limit the time for completing the work. Farmers Canal Co. v. Frank, 72jNeb. 136 (Pg. 154). Nor does a failure of the State Board of- Irrigation to adjudicate complainants' rights affect them as their rights were fully vested prior to the Act of 1895. Kearney Water! &amp; Irrigation Power Co. v. Alfalfa Irrigation District, 97 Neb. 139. j Dundy County Irrigation. Co. v. Morris, 107 Neb. 67. . j The claim as to forfeiture, for reasons that are obvious, is only faintly advanced by the defendant, but the claim that the complain - ants are barred by limitations is averred in the answer and insisted upon in the brief. The defendant relies on Sections 8506 and 8509 of the Compiled Statutes of 1922, which contain the general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as to the time of commencing actions. It also relies upon Section 8453, which relates to- the procedure to secure rights of way for irrigation canals. It is not perceived how these statutory provisions, or any of them^ support its contention. There are two answers to the claim, j The defendant is a public service corporation, and is bound to serve the public when its services are needed. It is a trustee, so to speak, for the landowners and being^ a trustee, it cannot refuse to perform its functions. Further, it did not refuse to sell permanent water rights- until about 1926, and as a matter of fact, it has served most of the complainants with a partial supply of water right up to this time, tinder these circumstances, it cannot be successfully asserted that there is any bar by limitations, </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION as not even the shortest period specified in the statutes has passed since it has refused service. . . The Commission finds all of the allegations of the complaint to be true and that the complainants are entitled to the relief prayed. Having arrived at this conclusion, the objections of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Commission to grant that relief are to be considered. The right of the state to assert its power of control over irriga - tion works was recognized in Castle Rock Irrigation Co. v. Jurisch, 67 Neb. 377, Farmers Canal Co. v. Frank, supra., Farmers &amp; (Merchants Irrigation Co. v. Brumbaugh, supra. There was, however, when those cases were decided, no tribunal vested with authority to fix rates. The jurisdiction to determine what compensation a common carrier may charge for its services is legislative and was therefore under the legislative department of the government. I Nebraska Telephone Com - pany v. State, 55 Neb. 627. As a canal company is not the owner of the water, Farmers Canal Co. v. Frank, supra., but is only the servant of the public in carrying and distributing it, its relation to the public has at all times been that of a common carrier. It waa therefore appropriate that the Railway Commission, having the regulation of other common carriers under the constitutional amendment of 1906, and having not only executive and judicial functions but legislative power also, Hooper Telephone Co. v. Nebraska Telephone Company, 96 Neb. 245, should be vested by the legislature with the power of regulation of the rates and service of irrigation companies. - The first act giving the Railway Commission jurisdiction over irrigation companies, was that' of 1911, introduced by Senator W. V. Hoagland, Laws 1911, Chapter 157, Page ;523. It declared irrigation works to be common carriers and gave the State Railway Commission jurisdiction over their rates.' (Cobbey An. Stat. 1911 Sec. 6924x2; C. S. 1911 Ch. 93 a, Art. 2, Sections .70 &amp; 71). The 1911 Act was repealed by the Act of 1913, Laws 1913, Chapter 254, Page 787. The Act of 1913, however, again declared irrigation works to be common carriers and revested the State Railway Commission with jurisdiction * of their rates. It also gave the Commission general control of such works. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act of 1913, are as follows: . \ ,■-..-. i "Sec. 4. Every corporation or person managing, owning or controlling any irrigation works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except irrigation districts, shall keep its head-gates, diversion dams, canals and laterals in reasonable and proper 1 repair for the delivery and diversion of water to the appropriates under its canal, and the regulation thereof shall be under the- control and direction of the State Railway Com - mission.

In 1919 the Act of 1911 (The Hoagland Act) was revived and re-enacted with slight changes and appears as Section 27 of Article 4, Page 856, Laws of 1919. In 1919 the Act of 1913 (which appears as Sections 3381-3385 inclusive of the 1913 Revised Statutes) was re-enacted, and appears as Sections 13-17 inclusive of Article 5, Division 1, Chapter 190, page 833, Laws of 1919. In 1921 the Law of 1913 (being Sections 3381 - 3385, inclusive, of the Revised Statutes of 1913) was repealed in part,, that is to say, the first three sections, being Sections 3381, 3382 and 3383, Revised Statutes of 1913, were repealed. Laws of 1921, Chapter 255, Page 869. The last two sections of the Act, which are quoted above, were not repealed. The repealing Act was introduced by Senator W. V. Hoagland, who had introduced, as stated above, the - original act giving the Commission jurisdiction over rates. The repeal affected only the abrogation of certain parts of the statutes, which were largely duplications. As Senator Hoagland introduced the first Act, that of 1911, and introduced the repealing act of 1921, it is • clear that the chief purpose was to remove the "duplications- It is evident that the defendant in this case has become confused by the multiplicity of acts and has assumed that the Act of 1921 repealed the act giving power to the State Railway. Commission. The net result of the various changes is to leave Sections 8418, 8419 and 8477, Compiled Statutes, 1922, in full force and effect. For convenience they are copied herein: "Sec. 8418. Every person managing, owning or controlling - any irrigation works for the storage, carriage or diversion of' water, except irrigation districts, shall keep its head-gates,- diver - sion dams, canals and laterals in reasonable and proper repair for the delivery and diversion of water to the appropriators - under its canal, and the regulation thereof shall be. under the control and direction of the state railway commission. ■■• "Sec. 8419.

            <seg id="p184">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING Miller, Commissioner: This complaint came on for hearing 'before the Commission on September 14, 1928. Complainants operate a large mill tlnd grain warehouse at Schuyler, a point on the Union Pacific main line, about 50 miles west of Omaha. Schuyler is also served by a branch line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company fron. Ashland to Schuyler. In the petition complainants ask the Commission to entei an order requiring the Burlington to absorb the in and outbound switching charges on cars of grain and grain products that are received at Schuyler, consigned to the complainant for delivery to its nill, which is located on Union Pacific rails. The complaint alleges that the complainant is descriininated against by reason of the fact that the defendant does not absorb the in and out switching charges at Schuyler but does absorb such in and outbound switching charges a 1 ; stations on its line on and east of' the Missouri River and at Lincoln, Nebraska. Complainant showed by competent witness that they received grain at Schuyler from points of origin on the Burlingtoi west of Ashland; that cars of wheat received from the Burlingtoi: stations were ground into flour and mill feed and that generally speaking one car of grain in required two cars on out shipments; that to[complete a transaction of one. car of grain received at their milling plant at Schuyler required the payment of switching charges at Scnuyler for the in and out movement of approximately $6.75 per inbound car of wheat. On cross examination, witness for the complainant admitted that the defendant did not absorb in and out switching charges on grain and grain products at Lincoln in the same manner as the com - plainant was asking the defendant to absorb at Schuyler; that such charges were absorbed at Omaha and at certain stations located on the defendants line of railroad. east of the Missouri river. Defendants showed that at most points in Nebraska other than those stations located on the Missouri river, it did not absqrb in and: outbound switching charges on grain and grain products as [requested by the complainant in these proceedings; that to absorb such charges at Schuyler would establish a precedent that would requirk them to absorb such charges at many other points in the state of [Nebraska and that the present earnings of the defendant would not justify any diminution in the revenues that are now received from the handling of grain in the state of Nebraska.

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This petition for reopening and reconsideration and /or rehearing in Formal Complaint No. 609, came on for argument before the entire Commission. Mr. Bergen, assistant traffic manager of the Omaha. Chamber of Commerce represented the complainants. He said, in his opening argument that he did not think it would be necessary to have a further hearing held in this complaint but hoped to con - vince the Commission that reconsideration of the Commission's order should be made as a result of the argument. At the time the petition was drawn, complainant appaiently was. under the impression that the order of the Commission, entered Dec - ember 1, 1928, (21 N. S. R. C. Reports, 166-173) had the) effect of cancelling all commodity rates on carload shipments of ice during the summer months. At the time of argument, it was admitted by representatives of the complainant that the order did not cancel com - modity rates on ice not specifically mentioned in the complaint. Mr. Bergen called attention to the fact that the order did not apply to the C. St. P; M. &amp; 0. Ry. Co., although that roa4 was made, a defendant in the original complaint ; that the rates in effect on the C. St. P. M. &amp; 0. Ry. were in some instances higher and in some lower - than the rates promulgated in the Commission's order. Mr. Bergen contended that because there are some commodity rates on carload shipments of ice between points in the state of Nebraska during the summer months that are lower than, the rates promulgated in the- Commission's order, the Commission erred in not establishing the rates from Omaha on as low a basis. as between other points in the order; that the provisions of the Railway Commission. Act required the Commission to accept such rates as a prima facie reason why the rates complained of should be on the same scale mile for mile. Representatives for the complainant contended that the record in this case justified the same rate on tearload shipments of ice during the summer months as are in effect on carload shipments of ice dur- </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ing the winter period. Mr. Bergen also contended that the minimum weight provided in the order had a tendency to work a hardship on the shippers of ice during the summer season; that the scale of rates T \aV . ire n-° r -° £ Eailroads durin g government control period should be controlling in the establishment of the rates from Omaha under the complaint. . Representatives of the defendants contended that the order of the Commission should stand as written. 1 As to the question of the rates on the I C. St. P. M. &amp; 0 Rail - way, Judge Root for the carriers, said it was a matter that was of little^importance, because the rates were so) closely the same that it would not materially affect shipments of ice from Omaha. Defendants contended that nothing had been shown in the record that would justify the Commission in changing the position it took as contained in the find - ings and order in Formal Complaint No. 241 ; at which time the Com - mission entered its order as to rates on carload shipments of ice during the winter season. After careful consideration of the petition, and of the matters presented in argument, we. are of the opinion and so find that the order entered by the Commission as of December 1,1 1928, should be modified so as to Provide that the rates therein provided will apply via the bt ; *' M \ &amp; °- R a»l w ay Company. In all other particulars, we are of the opinion and so find that the order should stand as provided in the original order entered. . We recognize however, that the rates on 'carload shipments of ice between many points of origin and destination in the state are not on a uniform basis, but inasmuch as we have 1 before us at the present time the question of readjustment of the Nebraska in(trastate and interstate class rates in connection with an investigation by the Inter - state Commerce Commission, known as Docket 17000, Part U we are of the opinion that the rates herein considered, as they are at the present time, except as provided in this supplemental order, should continue m effect until such time as the master is again brought to our attention, either in the manner of a formal complaint or npon the Commission's own motion.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This case came on for hearing before the Commission on formal complaint of Melvin L. Rawlings, a wholesale and retail dealer in ice, with warehouse located in Lincoln. The complaint is addressed against the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, and the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company. Paragraph IV of the complaint reads as follows: . "On said shipments the defendants demand, collect, re - ceive and retain, and complainant pays and bears the charges for the transportation thereof on the basis of rates named in tariffs now on file with the Nebraska State Railway Commission; that under the rates named in said tariffs for the transportation </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION of ice in carload quantities the cfiarge from Omaha to Lincoln, is 8y 2 cents per 100 pounds, with a carload minimum of 60,000 pounds; that said rate is excessive, unjust and unreasonable and far in excess of what a just, fair and reasonable rate should be, which should not be in excess of five cents per hundred pounds for said service.with a carload minimum not exceeding 55,000 pounds." 5 This complaint is dated August 1, 1928. Mr. Rawlings inter - vened in Formal Complaint No. 609, which! case involved the rates on carload shipments of ice from Omaha, on all roads, during the months of April to November, both included, ito destinations not more than 200 miles from Omaha. The rates established by the Commission in Formal Complaint No. 609 (21 N. S. R. C. Reports 166-173), pro - vide a rate of 6y 2 cents per 100 pounds on carload shipment's of ice during the summer months, minimum weight 50,000 pounds, from Omaha to Lincoln. Complainant asks that reparation be authorized on all shipments of ice made between Omaha and Lincoln prior to the two-year period from the time 'the complaint was filed, as pro - vided in Section 5500 of Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. In support of the complaint, the following testimony was intro - duced by the complainant: That at the time of hearing 90% of the ice handled by complainant was received from the Peoples Ice &amp; Cold Storage Company located in Omaha; that about 10% of the ice handled by the complainant is shipped to him from Wymore from a natural ice plant that he owns at that point; that he began the ice business in May, 1928; that the ice is transported largely by the Burlington in converted beer cars with the bunkers taken out; that the condition of the equipment in which the ice is transported is very poor; that they have a record of as much as 15' holes in the bottom of one of the ice cars; that before he started in the ice business in Lincoln, he ) had a conference with Mr. Montgomery, general freight agent of the / Burlington, who agreed to establish for him 1 a five cent rate from' Omaha to Lincoln. :•"•:'■■-• • ! On cross examination, he stated that tlie strongest competitors of the complainant in Lincoln is the Beatrice Creamery Company; that the storage capacity of his warehouse at Lincoln is about 600 tons; that at the time of hearing he had a standing order with the Peoples Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co., at Omaha to load four cars a day for him at Lincoln; that he shipped during 1928 about 80 cars from Omaha to Lincoln; that he has ten detail ice distributing points in Lincoln and vicinity; that from the first of April to the date of hearing, July 1, he had shipped 60 cars of ice to Lincoln from Omaha ; that, generally speaking, the cars are delivered at his warehouse in Lincoln in blocks of two or three cars at a time; that the average weight contained in the cars is between 52,000 and 58,000 poiinds; that the cars are usually set at his warehouse early in the morning; that the complain- </seg>
            <seg id="p190">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT ant expects to receive an average of four cars a day during the months of July and August; that he had filed damages against the railroad company for ice breakage in the sum of $100 to $150; that in his opinion considerable of this damage to the ice was occasioned by reason of the inferior cars furnished the Omaha plant for loading to Lincoln. Mr. E. C. Forsberg, representative of the Peoples Ice &amp; Cold Stor - age Company at Omaha, testified on behalf of the complainant. The major portion of the ice produced by his company was sold to consum - ing trade in Omaha; that the major portion of the carload shipments of ice made by his company were consigned to Mr. Rawlings at Lincoln; that the loading of ice depends somewhat on weather conditions; that the dimensions of a cake of artificial ice manufactured by his company are 46 inches high, 11 inches wide and 22 inches long, and that the cake when manufactured runs around 325 pounds; that the cars were loaded with the cakes on end, nine cakes across the car; that in order to make the load ride solid they wedge the ice by cutting cakes of ice in wedge shape and putting in. between the tiers; that this method of loading cars has been determined, upon after considerable experi - mentation; that the manufacturing plant is located on the tracks of the North Western and Illinois Central railroads; that at the time of hearing he had an order from the complainant to load four cars of ice a day to Lincoln; that usually these cars are set into the manufac - turing plant during the night; that the cars are placed on the transfer by the Burlington and handled during the night by the North Western or the Illinois Central to his warehouse tracks; that the track on the west side of the plant holds four cars; that in loading they drop the cars down a short way in order to get room for loading the next car; that there is a sharp curve close to his plant that makes it necessary for the cars to be dropped from the plant down past the curve because the Illinois Central engine that oft-times does the switching cannot make the curve without liability of derailment which makes it necessary for the cars to be dropped down past the curve in order that the engine may hook on to the cars; that the cars loaded with ice are tagged to show that they are ice cars; in addition to this the cars handled by the Burlington are boarded showing that they are to be loaded with ice. A witness, on behalf of the complainant, introduced extensive exhibits comparing the rates on ice from Omaha to Lincoln with rates on numerous other commodities. One of these exhibits shows the following figures: </seg>

Numerous other - exhibits were introduced showing the rates on ice from Omaha to Lincoln as compared with the rates on ice and numerous other com - modities between points in Nebraska and in other states. On behalf of the defendants, representatives of the Burlington railroad offered in evidence from the Commission's records the peti - tion of intervention in Formal Complaint No. 609 made by Mr. Rawl - ings; also the. testimony introduced by Messrs. Hoff elder, L. B. Lyman, Charles Frankenburger, A. C. Matson and E.JF. Scott together with the exhibits identified by those witnesses and introduced in evidence. The record taken before the Commission in the hearing in Formal Complaint Noi 609 of September 19 was introduced in this record. This record in - cluded the testimony of Messrs. W. T. Mettlen, S. F. Braun, F. S. Van Sant, G. A. Hoffeldei} Charles Frankenburger, A. C. Matson and R..W. Fletcher, including the cross examination. The defendants asked that, the testimony in all of the hearings in Formal Complaint No. 609 be considered by the Commission in its decision in connection with the complaint herein considered. Objection was raised by the complainant to the introduction of the records here mentioned. It was the ruling of Presiding Commissioner Randall that the consideration of the records introduced on behalf of defendants would not— "jeopardize the right of the complainant in this case and it will be accepted in this case as it is practically a continua - tion of the case No. 609 and the only question raised at the pres - ent time, not adduced in evidence, is the question of reasonableness of the rates on ice between Omaha and Lincoln and the Commission will consider that. They will consider the testimony of these witnesses under oath here and give their testimony in the previous case."

            <seg id="p192">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT by reason of the claim for damages on carload shipments of ice the traffic was not a desirable commodity for transportation; that a revenue per car of $32.50 now in effect was not an unreasonable rate on carload shipments of ice from Omaha to-Lincoln. ■ • CONCLUSIONS As shown by the foregoing statement of testimony introduced at time of hearing, the question of claims for damages is an important one in the consideration of the rates herein brought in review before the Commission. According to the record, considerable of this damage is occasioned by the class of equipment the carriers have been in the habit of furnishing for 1 transportation of ice between Omaha and Lincoln. This question is one, in our opinion, that should be cor - rected by the carriers at the earliest possible moment, so that ice properly loaded at Omaha can be transported to destination without injury to the contents of the car. Large holes in the floor and side of the cars tend to increase the loss in weight by melting of the ice in transit. Rough floors in the cars make it impractical to load the ice as satisfactorily as it could be loaded if the floor were level. This is a matter that should be given proper attention by the carrier. The question of quantity movement of a given commodity be - tween points in the state has heretofore been considered by the Com - mission in numerous cases. The scale established by us in Formal Complaint No. 609, supra, was intended to take care of any quantity movement forwarded from Omaha to destinations within 200 miles of that city, during the summer months. In this case we have the ques - tion of establishing a reasonable rate on carload shipments of ice, where a much larger number of cars move to Lincoln from Omaha than is usually transported under the scale adopted in Formal Com - plaint No. 609, supra. From a cost standpoint, it is much less expensive per car for the carrier to set two or three cars in a block into a loading point and. set the same to an unloading track, than it is to handle the traffic in single carload shipments. The testimony here is that during the heated season, four cars a day are loaded by the ice manufacturing company at Omaha consigned to the complainant at Lincoln. It is shown in the record that before the complainant established his ice business in Lincoln that the Burlington railroad promised him to establish a rate of five cents per 100 pounds on carload shipments of ice from Omaha to Lincoln. The record also shows that the Burlington did make ap - plication to the Commission on July 17, 1928, to publish a rate of five cents per 100 pounds, minimum weight 60,000 pounds on carload ship - ments of ice from Omaha to Lincoln. This application was withdrawn by the Burlington and not considered by the Commission. It is to be noted that in the above mentioned application, the Burlington sought to </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION • ■ •.•■'■ establish a minimum weight of 60,000 pounds based on the five cent rate. The question of loading cars to a minimum of 60,000 pounds is important. According to the testimony, of (the representatives of the Omaha Peoples Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co., they were loading at the time of hearing all that possibly could be loaded | in the cars by loading one tier of ice on end, it being necessary to load ice^this way in order to keep it from shifting and being broken in transit. It was the testimony of the complainant that ice received in a broken condition is unsalable. The Commission, in numerous cases has reduced rates and in - creased the minimum weights so as to get about the same revenue for the carrier. In this case, however, it does not seem practical to require the cars to be loaded to 60,000 pounds. In ihe complaint, complainant asks that a reasonable rate be established on 55,000 pound minimum weight. The testimony is that the cars are now being loaded from 26 to 27 tons per car. Every effort should be made by the carrier and the shipper of ice to load the cars as heavy as they can be loaded and still be transported without injury to the ice. For the purpose of this case, we will establish a minimum weight of 55,000 pounds. ; In the first instance, the Burlington proposed to establish a rate of five cents on carload shipments of ice from Omaha to Lincoln. .■■■■■'•:'.'.'•■.•' In the record in Formal Complaint No. 1 609, supra, it was shown that there is a municipally operated artificial ice plant in Omaha; that by reason of the muncipal competition, the Peoples Ice &amp; Cold Storage Company is attempting to keep their plant running to its max - imum capacity by shipping ice to points outside of Omaha. . In this record, complainant testified that he had established his retail price on ice in Lincoln based on a five 'cent rate. The establish - ment of a reasonable rate is a legislative act in which all of the con - ditions and circumstances surrounding the iransportation of a given commodity must be taken into account. In the classification of com - modities, ice is given the lowest rating (Class E) of any commodity offered to the carriers for transportation. The volume of movement, that is the number of cars that can be handled from one consignor to one consignee at one time, has been given important consideration in the establishment of the rate found reasonable by us herein. We, of course, are aware of the fact j that during the summer months there will not be a constant shipment during the whole period of a maximum number of cars per day, which in this record is shown to be four cars, but having this in mind, the|maximum movement dur - ing the heated season will tend to niateriallly increase the average of cars handled per day. If this average should run as high as two cars per day this fact would appear to justify a reduction in the rates established by us in Formal Complaint No. 609, supra. </seg>
            <seg id="p194">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT . After careful consideration of all the facts of record, we are of the opinion and so find that a rate of five cents per 100 pounds, minimum weight 55,000 pounds will represent a reasonable rate for carload shipments of ice from Omaha, to Lincoln, during the months of April to November, both included. In the complaint, we are asked to award reparation on all cars of ice that have been shipped to the complainant from Omaha during the two year period provided in the statutes. The recoifd shows that there has been a material increase in the number of cars of ice shipped to the complainant from Omaha during the year 1929. That the maximum movement of cars per day occured in June, 1929. In the establishment of a reasonable rate on carload shipments of ice from Omaha to Lincoln during the summer months, we have given considerable weight to the numben of cars moving per day. We realize that the number of cars that complainant required for his trade depends very largely upon weather conditions. When the complainant started to receive cars of ice from Omaha, the rate in effect was 8y 2 cents per 100 pounds, based on the regular Class "E" rate in effect between Omaha and Lincoln minimum weight 40,000 pounds. On December 1, 1928, after full hearing, in Formal Complaint No. 609, we established a scale of rates which had the effect of making the rate on carload shipments of ice from Omaha to Lincoln during the summer months 6% cents per 100 pounds minimum weight 50,000 pounds. In view of the fact that we have reduced the 6y 2 cent rate on this record largely because of the increased movement per day, we feel the same general consideration should be given the question of reparation. In view of all of the testimony offered in this record, we are of the opinion and so find that reparation should be awarded complainant on all carloads of ice forwarded from Omaha. to Lincoln, consigned to complainant, during the two year period next preceding June 1, 1929; on a basis of GV 2 cents per 100 pounds, minimum weight 50,000 pounds; that from June 1, 1929, to the effective date of this order, reparation should be awarded complainant on the basis of five cents per 100 pounds and 55,000 pound minimum. In view of the fact that complainant is now receiving large quantities of ice, this rate will be made to become effective oh less than statutory provision, as provided in the order entered herein.

On the effective date of the order, representatives of the defendants called at i the offices of the Com - mission and showed that the complainant herein has received from Omaha a little more than an average of two cars of ice per day for the first twenty days of July. At the time of hearing, complainant showed in record that there was a standing order with the Omaha manufacturer of ice for four cars of ice per day. The rate authorized by the Com - mission in the original order was largely based upon the increasing number of ears of ice that were to be shipped from Omaha to Lincoln, </seg>
            <seg id="p196">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT consigned to the complainant. The following is quoted from our find - ings in this case: . . "The question of quantity movement of a given commodity between points in the state has heretofore been considered by the Commission in numerous cases. The scale established by us in Formal Complaint No. 609 was intended to take care of any quantity movement forwarded from Omaha to destinations within 200 miles of that city, during the summer months. In this case we have the question of establishing a reasonable rate on carload shipments of ice where a much larger number of cars move to Lincoln from Omaha than is usually transported under the scale adopted in Formal Complaint No. 609. From a cost standpoint, it is much less expensive per car for the carrier to set two or three. cars in a. block into a loading point and set the same to an unloading track, than it is to handle the traffic in single carload shipments. The testimony here is that during the heated season, four cars a day are loaded by the ice manufacturing company at Omaha consigned to the complainant at Lincoln." . In the July 22 conference above referred to, defendants contended that the record showed that the number of cars of ice shipped to the complainant would fall far short of four cars per day and even less than two cars a day if the summer period was allowed to stand as provided in our order dated July 16, and asked that the order of the Commission be modified so as to include the months of June to August, inclusive, rather than from April 1st. to November 1st. The contention of the defendants was submitted to the com - plainant and he was asked if he would agree to the stipulation that the order be modified to read June 1st to August 31st, rather than April to November, inclusive. The complainant, through his representative, has now submitted to the Commission in writing a statement that he is willing that the original order be modified to read June to September inclusive. Defendants have agreed to the modification. Consequently, the original order will be modified so as to provide that the rate of five cents per 100 pounds on carload shipments of ice from Omaha to Lincoln minimum weight 55,000 pounds shall apply over the defendants lines during the months of June to September, both included. In other particulars our order will remain as originally entered. An appropriate order will be entered.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman : ■■: This action arises upon formal complaint of the Chamber of Commerce of Hastings, in which it appears, on behalf of certain hay dealers at that point. The complaint is directed against the Union Pacific Railroad- Company, and alleges the collection of "unjust, un - reasonable and discriminating" rates prior to January 30, 1927, cover - ing the movement of hay from Maxwell, Elm Creek and certain inter - mediate points to Hastings; further alleges that complainants have been -damaged thereby and prays for reparation. Defendant admits the movements in question ; admits that the! rates complained of have </seg>
            <seg id="p198">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT been collected, but denies the allegation of injustice, unreasonableness and discrimination. Petition of intervention was filed by the Chamber of Commerce of Grand Island, 'which was granted. Hearing upon the complaint was held at Hastings, on. November 9, 1928. STATEMENT OF FACTS During the summer of 1926, drouth. conditions prevailed generally in Adams County, Hastings being the county seat thereof. Because of these conditions, the Union Pacific, without admitting the reasonable - ness of the rates, established, effective January 31, 1927, a schedule of rates covering movement of hay from Maxwell and intermediate points to Hastings, on the Grand Island basis. This provided for a very marked reduction on hay rates from the points named, to Hastings. There was a considerable volume of movement of hay from these points to Hastings during the six months immediately preceding the reduc - tion, and it is on these shipments that reparation is demanded. The distance from any of the origin points to Hastings and Grand Island is practically the same, Hastings being one-tenth of a mile closer in each instance. Complainant placed two witnesses on the stand, each a hay dealer, and each of whom* testified that he had shipped hay from points in question to Hastings and had paid personally the freight rate in ques - tion, freight bills being presented as evidence of such shipments. Other shipments involved in the complaint were presented through the medium of affidavits evidencing in each instance that shipments moved and that deponent paid the freight charges personally. Freight bills were attached. These affidavits were received of record, subject to stipulation offered by counsel for defendant, voluntarily agreed to by complainants, the same being as follows : "I would be willing to stipulate, if the witnesses were here and cross-examined, that they would testify that in fixing the price of the hay, they took into consideration the freight charges with other things, and included the freight charges in the selling price. That is what Mr. Graham testified to." Record PP 21. There is some conflict in testimony of complainant witnesses Graham and Schultz respecting the question of whether freight charges^ paid were passed on to the ultimate consumer. Witness Graham was of the opinion that with respect to shipments made by him, such was the case in the main. Witness Schultz, on the other hand, was insistent that freight charges had not been passed on by him to the ultimate consumer; that this was true if, for no other reason, because of the fact that the greater portion of his hay had been stored and was sold after the freight Tate reduction, and the price of the hay reduced com - mensurately with the freight rate reduction. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE.RAILWAY COMMISSION COMPLAINANT'S CONTENTIONS Complainants insist that rates paid are unjust, unreasonable and •dwcruninatory to the extent that they exceed the Grand Island rate The following table sets forth comparative rates to Grand Island and Hastings during the period involved in the complaint, and immediately prior. to January 31, 1927 :• J Shipping Points Hastings Grand Island Rate Rate •Gibbon 9 7 y 2 °Ptic . 9 . 71/2 Odessa 12 iy. Elm Creek 12 7 y 2 Overton . 12 • 9 Josslyn .12 9 Lexington " 13i/ 2 g Darr 13y 2 g €ozad 14y 2 9 Willow Island 14y 2 g Gothenburg 15i£ g Hindrey ny 2 9 Maxwell ny 2 g At the same time there was in effect a rate on hay of 4y 2 cents from Grand Island to Hastings via St. J. &amp; G. I. Railway hereinafter "called the Grand Island, thereby giving a Grand Island combination into Hastings much less than the actual rate collected. Complainants point out that per ton mile earnings, per car mile earnings and per car revenue on hay to Hastings, as compared to Grand Island,, during, the period in dispute, were much greater to Hastings. Taking Lexington as a typical point: To Hastings, per ton mile earn - ings are 35 mills, per car mile earnings 42c and per car revenue $32.40; to Grand Island, per ton mile earnings 23 mills, per car mile earnings 27.6c and per car revenue $21.60. Comparisons are also made as to earnings on hay from points in. question to Hastings, as compared with earnings for similar distances on the Grand Island, and earnings from and to other Nebraska points on other (roads. In each instance, the comparison shows higher returns from the Hastings movement. Complainants also make comparison of j earnings as between hay moving into Hastings under the rate in question and earnings for similar distances from movement of sugar beets, hogs, cattle and sheep, stock cattle from Omaha under the 75 per cent rate, and bulk apples. In each instance the comparisons show higher returns for similar dis - tances on the hay movement into Hastings' than on the other com - modities named. It is also pointed out by complainants! that the hay in question moved from origin points as far as Gibbon; in the same trains that </seg>
            <seg id="p200">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT ■ ■ ■ . ' ■■ ! moved hay to Grand Island. At Gibbon, Hastings hay was set out and moved in local freights to Hastings. The further fact was mentioned that a sales pavillion was opened at Hastings in January, 1926, and that the business of the pavillion was growing. This sales pavillion handles both horses and cattle. DEFENDANT'S CONTENTIONS Defendant complains of comparisons made by complainants. It is pointed out that hay 1 rates into Grand Island are on a very. low basis, due to a constant volume of movement. Large feeding yards are located at this point and these create a year around market for hay. This volume of movement, it is contended, justifies the low rate into Grand Island. Defendant stresses the importance of volume of move - ment as a prominent factor in establishing rates. Defendant's Exhibit D sets forth the movement of hay from points in question to Hastings and Grand Island for the years 1925. to 1927,. inclusive, and the first nine months of 1928. This exhibit reflects total carload movements into Grand Island and Hastings for certain years from Union Pacific points named, as follows: Year 1925 Year 1926 Year 1927 First 9 Mo. 1928 at at •■ ■ at at Grand Grand Grand Grand Island Hastings Island Hastings Island Hastings Island Hastings 142 32 244 155 231 75 217 10 Defendant also complains of the comparison involved in the using of rates of the Grand Island Railway. It was stated that rates on the Grand Island were depressed rates and that that carrier had made application to the Nebraska Commission to. raise them, but had de - ferred pressing its action, pending outcome' of investigation now under - way before the interstate Commerce Commission relative to rates on hay, I. C. C. Docket 17,000— Part 10. Defendant also alleges that complainant's comparisons respecting earnings on hay, sugar beets, - hogs, etc., are unfair for a 'variety of reasons. Defendant's Exhibit E sets forth certain comparison of rates and earnings on hay, under different scales. Taking Lexington as a typical point: Under commodity rates on hay from that point to Hastings, effective as of January 30, 1927, a distance of 77.4 miles, using a 40 ft. car, minimum 24,000, the per car mile earnings amount to 27.91 cents. Using the same distance and the same size car, under the Nebraska distance scale the per car mile earnings amount to 41.86 cents; under the Kansas distance scale 34.11 cents and under the Kansas-Missouri distance- scale 46.51 cents. Earnings under other distance scales were also set forth, each of which showed greater return than the Hastings commodity rates. </seg>

Defendant stresses the importance of volume of move - ment as a prominent factor in establishing rates. Durine this six months period, 126 cars of hay were moved! from 12 different origin XT £ UeS ?°T n ,' *i Hastin S s - Hastin gs hay moved in the same trains as Grand Island hay as far as Gibbon,! at which point Hastings Jay moved on to'Hastings via branch line service and Grand Island hay moved on to Grand Island via main line service. The mileage to tJie two points is the same. Operating conditions could not be markedly different. The same drouth conditions that prompted the voluntary establishment of the lower rate after January 30, 1927, existed during the six months just preceding. A defendant | witness testified that if the volume of movement of hay into Hastings during 1926 were perman - ent, serious consideration should be given ti&gt; establishment of com - modity rates covering such a movement. It I is true, as reflected by defendant's Exhibit D above quoted, that this movement is not a per - manent one. It is thought that this volume !of movement during the particular period named, having in mind other facts and circumstances, . justifies the finding that the Grand Island rate is a reasonable one </seg>
            <seg id="p202">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT &gt; The Commission is not here finding, however, that the Grand Island rate is reasonable for the future. It is its opinion, however, that at no time should the Hastings rate exceed the Grand Island combination. The Union Pacific Railroad and the St. J. &amp; G. I. Railway are under common ownership and management. Certainly the through rate should not be in excess of the sum of the locals. Having in mind the volume of movement during the six months' period set out, and the circumstances and conditions under which it moved, it is found that the rates voluntarily established by the carrier January 30, 1927, are reasonable rates for the particular period in question; also that the rates actually collected are unreasonable to the degree above set forth. It is not an unusual procedure to establish commodity rates for a volume movement during a temporary period, the rates to be subject to cancellation at the close of the movement. The earners on a number of occasions, have requested authority of the Commission to establish commodity 'rates covering a volume movement during a temporary period. From the facts above set forth, it is not to be concluded that a voluntary reduction in rates by carriers is in each instance at the peril of liability for reparation. The awarding of reparation isnot a neces - sary or certain resultant in the voluntary reduction of rates by a carrier. Having found the rates unreasonable, the Commission is confronted with the question of whether it is necessary, under the provisions of Section 5500 of Compiled Statute's of Nebraska, 1922, to also find that complainants suffered damages by reason thereof. While federal provisions relating to the award of reparation by the Interstate Com - merce Commission are not entirely similar to Nebraska statutory provisions, the problem of the Interstate Commerce Commission in determining who actually bears the burden of the freight rate, is some - what similar to the problem confronting this Commission. . In National Poultry, Butter &amp; Egg Association v. B. &amp; 0. S. W. R. R., 51 I. C. C. Reports 49, the Interstate Commerce Commission said : "While defendants seek to show that with respect to a large part of the traffic involved, the complainants here before us did not ultimately bear the transportation charges, but passed them on to consignees in the form of increased prices, that fact would not preclude an award of reparation to the complainants." Again, in Ballou &amp; Wright v. New York, N. H. &amp; H., 34 I. C. C. 121, the Interstate Commission said: "Carriers cannot be heard to say- that reparation' for the exaction of unreasonable freight rates should be denied because </seg>

The complaint recites, isJ' 1 ™™" 16 Miss ° uri Pacific Railroad Company did on March 15th, 1928, unlawfully discriminate against complainant and did not extend said complainant the same privileges or rights extended other like receivers of merchandise in that communitv or locality under Section 5318 of the Revised Statutes of Ne - braska, for 1922. That complainant! was subjected to demands . embarrassements, etc., that infringed! or imposed upon his rights in accordance with conditions and usages that were in effect in that community or locality at thai time." • • The facts as shown by the testimony, las given by Mr. Miller, the complainant, and the company's agent, are! as follows: The agent of defendant company in accordance with orders given to him by the company, required all of the business men of the town of Cook, to give a written order to him for the delivery of their; goods, to anyone other than themselves. Said order has been prepared by the defend - ant company and is the one used over their entire system. These orders were presented to the business men of the town each year and all of them, except the complainant, signecl. For several years last past, complainant admitted that he had signed *n. order of this kind, that his goods had been delivered to the party he authorized to receipt for same, but he had concluded that was unnecessary, and would not sign an order for the agent to "de - liver to any certain person. He continued to send different ones after his freight and express, without giving them a written order ot any kind to be presented to. the agent, when demanding delivery of the goods. The agent had refused to deliver any merchandise to anyone except complainant himself, unless he would furnish a writ - ten order to the party he desired the goods delivered to. Complainant has consistently insisted on the goods being delivered to whomever he might send without the written order, and the agent has 3 ust as persistently refused to deliver the 1 goods except to complain - ant, or someone authorized by him in writing. The agent has been acting strictly in accordance with the rules and regulations laid down </seg>
            <seg id="p206">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT to nun by his superior officers, and testimony snows that a violation of this rule would subject the agent to severe censure and possibly dismissal from the service, if he did not follow the rule and regula - tions laid down by the company. Railroad and express companies receipt to the consignor for goods delivered to them for transportation. They are responsible to the consignor or consignee for the value of these goods and' it is a matter of good sound business practice that they have adopted the plan they have in requiring the agent not to deliver these goods to anyone except the consignee, or some one authorized by him in writing to receipt for his goods. As already stated testimony shows that there was not another business man in the town that had not signed and delivered to the agent a written order. The agent admitted that in .some instances he had delivered goods to the complainant's son without a written order and permitted him to receipt for the goods, and that he had done the same thing with some of the farmers who had sent some of their family after goods, but he knew that they were members of the family, and he knew that the. young man was complainant's son. While it was a breach of instructions from his company to do that, he was willing to take the chance of a loss, which if there had been one, he would have had to make good. That practice has been dis - continued and in the future the instructions of his company will be strictly adhered to. If there has been any discrimination complainant has been the recipient of the favors as much and probably more than any other of the shippers who have been doing business with the company at that station. In so far as discrimination is. concerned, the Commission does not consider there has been any and the complaint is not borne out by the facts. It developed all through the hearing that this complainant not only wants to run his own business, but run the business of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company as well. After having been fully advised of the rule, and after having been presented with the printed form furnished by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and by the American Railway Express Company, he refused to sign and demanded that the agent deliver his goods to whom ever he might send for the freight or express. His attitude all through the hearing as a witness was that of an arbitrary "obstreperate" and after considering all the facts in the testimony taken at the hearing, the Commission feels that the agent of defendant company at Cook should be commended for his loyalty to his company in carrying out their instructions. If consignees of merchandise were permitted to take their goods from express and freight offices without receipting for them, otf having someone that had been given authority receipt for them, it would re- </seg>

The Bartley Mutual Telephone Company claimed this compen - sation was not sufficient for the use of the line owned by the Bartley Mutual Telephone Company, between Bartley and Cambridge. . It developed during the hearing that there were several other companies tributary to Bartley that were also using this line, some of them going through the Cambridge exchange, which were not paying . the Bartley Company any toll but all the toll was being retained by the Cambridge Telephone Company and other companies and the Bart - ley Mutual Telephone Company was not receiving anything for this ser - vice. These companies that were getting this service had not been notified and made a party to the complaint and were not present at the hear - ing, so that the only testimony we had relating to this service, was gleaned from Mr. Clark, Secretary of the Bartley Mutual Telephone Company. . It also developed that on the second day of December, 1927, the Bartley Mutual Telephone Company and the Cambridge Telephone Company had made an agreement for the five-cent toll charge between the two companies. This agreement was drawn up, but was not signed at that time, but at a later date. On January 14, 1928, a meeting was held by the Bartley Mhitual Telephone Company. A certified copy of the proceedings of such meeting was received in testimony show - ing that a motion was. made and voted on to abrogate the contract made on December 2nd, which had not been signed by the officers of the Bartley Mutual Telephone Company. There were four directors present at that meeting, two of the directors voted to abrogate, one voted in the negative and one failed to vote. The presiding officer declared the motion was carried, but as a matter of fact the action of the board at this meeting did not abrogate the contract, as only two of the five directors voted for the motion. The motion was. lost and the contract that had been agreed to between the companies on the division of toll was in effect and full force, notwithstanding the fact that it had not been signed by the presiding officer at that time, but was later signed by the president of the company. The Commission does not feel they should interfere with an agree - ment made between the two companies in the division of toll charges, as this agreement was entered into after due deliberation by both companies interested. While the Commission under the law is not bound by this agreement, it does not find in the record justification for setting it aside. There is no question but what the Bartley Mutual Telephone Com - pany is entitled to more revenue from this toll line.between Bartley and Cambridge, but it is very questionable as to whether the Cambridge Com - panv should be required to stand a larger percentage of the expense as messages are going over the line from Indianola, Wilsonville, </seg>

COMMISSIONER RANDALL PRESIDING. BY THE COMMISSION: This case came for hearing before the Commission on complaint of the Associated General Contractors of America, an association composed of forty-three highway and public works contractors in Nebraska, known as the Nebraska chapter. There are 110 similar organizations in the United States. The headquarters of the Nebraska Association are located in Lincoln. The third paragraph of the com - plaint reads as follows : ■ • . '• "That said defendant carriers are charging unreasonable freight rates for the transportation of contractors' outfits in - cluding motor driven outfits except motor trucks and passenger cars between points in Nebraska as compared with the rates charged in adjoining states, when these outfits are classified as class A 24,000 pounds minimum." The prayer of the complainant asks the Commission to establish reasonable rates for the shipment of contractors' outfits on Nebraska intrastate traffic. Representatives for the complainant summarize the reasons why the rates herein complained of are unreasonably high : (1) That there has been a large increase in the volume of contract - ors' outfits handled by the carriers in Nebraska ; (2) That the development of motor power equipment has had a marked influence on this class of shipment; (3) That the present rates are discriminatory against contractors, outfits when compared with certain commodities of the same general nature; (4) That the present classification for contractors' outfits prevents the loading of certain modern equipment, which modern equip - ment is a part of these outfits but which move at a higher rate ;• (5) That the administration of the present work on the state high - ways produces a large volume of movement of contractors'" outfits by freight; </seg>
            <seg id="p211">1 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION (6) That the further development of the state highway system will increase the volume of these freight movements; (7) That the contractors are now paying for transportation service which they cannot take advantage of on account of the develop - ment of motor equipment; (8) That the loss and damage claims 'against the carriers on ac - count of these freight movements are practically nil; (9) That the movement of contractors'! outfits by the carriers can be accomplished with much less expense to the carriers than certain other like commodities taking the same general rate and minimum weight; (10) That the carriers recognize the principle of charging a lower rate on used equipment than on new| equipment in certain cases; (11) That some of the carriers in Nebraska voluntarily published rates on second hand machinery and other commodities com - prising contractors' outfits, which rates are about 50% less than the published rate for contractors' outfits; (12) That the carriers in Nebraska are charging rates for the trans - portation of contractors' outfits very much in excess of the rates charged in adjoining states fori like transportation service. A number of members of the Nebraska Association testified in support of the complaint. The testimony of Mr. C. W. Roberts of Lincoln, can be used as representative of the general testimony intro - duced by witnesses for the complaint. Mr. Roberts testified that he has been' in the contracting business in Nebraska for twenty years; that in highway construction contract - ors' outfits usually consist of grading machinery, generally hauled by tractor engines, sleeping and dining room bunk houses and small tools and other equipment; that a modern contractors' outfit performs a given job in very much less time than they did 15 or 20 years ago; that at the present time live stock is very seldom loaded with con - tractors' outfits; that a modern contractors' outfit used for grading and highway building usually consists of from six to eight cars; that these cars are moved as one complete outfii; that the loss and damage claims against the carriers during recent years have been practically , nothing; that generally speaking the outfits' of bridge builders, gravel - ers, graders, paving and building contractors, so far as freight trans - portation, is concerned is substantially the| same; that ten or fifteen years ago 20,000 yards of grading was a big year's work, while at the present time a modern outfit will grade about 200,000 yards per annum; that on highway, paving steel side forms constitute a considerable part of the equipment; that there is very keen] competition between con - tractors located within and without the state of Nebraska; that gen - erally speaking Nebraska contractors secure the major portion of Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p212">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT braska contracts; that on the larger jobs, above $150,000, contractors located in other states compete very keenly for the •work. Representatives of complainant introduced in the record orders entered by the states of Kansas and Oklahoma in regard to the rates on carload shipments of contractors' outfits, and showed that the rates, in the states of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas are materially lower than the rates in Nebraska. Complainant suggested, a scale of rates that would, in their opinion, correct the rates com - plained of in Nebraska intrastate traffic. The scale is based upon aa average of the rates in effect in Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri. The following is quoted from the testimony of Mr. R. 0. Green, on. behalf of the complainant : . '.'•.' "This is citations of published classifications and rates which, we show contractors' outfits at class A and tonnage, also at class A dump wagons, but with a 20,000 pound minimum. The purpose of the conference here is between the dump wagons and other items in the contractors outfit, such as bunk cars. Our i testimony showed that the dump wagons loaded heavier, yet we - have them published at a lesser minimum weight, than the regular outfit. Then there is the item of harvesters and threshers, which move at class A 20,000 pound minimum. There is a comparison, in the amount of space required between the harvester and bunk cars with the bunk ears moving at a higher minimum. Equipment,, new and used, We have wheel barrows in less than carload lots, moving in class I. Then when they are described as a part of a contractors' outfits they move in class 2. On a carload, basis the wheel barrows move class A at 24,000 pounds and when mixed with pavers and mixers they move in class 5 at 26,000 pounds. On mixing machines we have power asphalt, cement or concrete - mixing' machines moving at class A, 24,000 pound minimum and. pavers mixing machines moving at class 5, 36,000 pound minimum.. The purpose of those is to show that the carriers do recognize in certain instances that ' second-hand equipment moves at. a lesser - rate and properly so. We have agricultural implements generally moving at class A 24,000 pound minimum. Then, we have listed a number of items of contractors outfits which move at class A when new. This contractors' outfit also moves at class A when - old. Our comparison there is that the contractors' outfit is less; liable to damage in shipment than the agricultural implements, probably on account of the sturdiness with which the contractors' equipment is built. On the next page I have listed trucks or tractors. Since we have amended our original complaint of course our comments in regard to the truckg would be nil. The tractors — you see them listed there at class A. We have certain published rates in Nebraska, C. B. &amp; Q. GFO 15825. (The bal - ance of the exhibit under this heading was read by Mr. Green r </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION to the end of the exhibit.) It is quite apparent why we intro - duced that testimony, those are the voluntary rates of the carriers and so appear in their tariffs." In regard to the amending of the original complaint, the following testimony was given by Mr. Green, secretary of the Nebraska Associa - tion : Q. (By Mr. Weingarten) You have amended paragraph three of your complaint so that by interlining, "including motor driven equipment, except motor trucks and passenger cars." I mil ask you to state just what it is you are asking under that amendment. A. I would say that we are clarifying our complaint as a re - sult of the discussion which took place here before lunch. ■I Q. Your original complaint was class A rating as described in the classification was unreasonable? Now does the amend - ment change that in any respect? A. Yes. Q. In what respect? A. I would say in respect to wheel tractors. Q. In. other words you, are asking then that the classification description be amended and modified so that contractors outfits include wheel tractors, is that it? A. We modify it to include wheel! tractors and other motor' driven equipment. Q. Except motor trucks and passenger cars? A. Yes sir. ■ • ■ ■ Q. It is your understanding that the present classification or description of contractors outfits does not include those four, except motor trucks and passenger cars? A. What I am trying to give you is 1 the interpretation which is placed. Q. They may have placed a wrong interpretation on that de - scription, but that doesn't change it. That is only subject to correction. I don't know whether the present description includes those or not. A. The present description says on page 338, says in substance . this "except motor vehicles." Q. You want that included? A. Yes sir. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Several Nebraska contractors appeared at the hearing and testified that they were satisfied with the present rates on contractors' outfits; that they thought the charges were just and reasonable for the ser - vices performed. Complainants sought to show that these witnesses were testifying on behalf of the carriers because they did a large amount of railroad construction work for certain Nebraska carriers. j DEFENDANTS Defendants showed that a similar complaint to the one herein considered was brought before the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket No. 18913, reported in 144 ICC 305, decided May 26, 1928, in which the Interstate Commission found that "the rate assailed is not unreasonable. The complaint will be dismissed." The title of the case here mentioned is the Associated General Contractors of America et al vs. A. T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., et al. The following is quoted from the report of the Commission: "Complainants are the Associated General Contractors of America, an incorporated association of general contractors doing business at various places in the United States, with principal offices at Washington, D. C, and the Kansas-Missouri Contract - ors Association, now the Kansas Contractors Association, a voluntary association of general contractors in Kansas and Miss - ouri. By complaint filed October 9, 1926, as amended, they allege that the carload rating of class A in the western classifica - tion for contractor's outfits without livestock is unreasonable to the extent it exceeds class B. We are asked to prescribe class B for the future;" Mr. J. B. Driggs, assistant general. freight agent of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., testified as follows in regard to the history of the present classification rating on contractors' outfits: Q. State the history of the classification rating in the Western Classification territory on contractors outfits'? A. The first record we have of outfits being rated as such was in Western Classification No. 2, effective July 25, 1887. The item at that time reads, graders, outfits, second hand class A. In Western Classification No. 44, effective May 1st, 1908 the description was made graders and contractors outfits, second hand, minimum weight 24,000 pounds, class A. This was the classification applicable in Nebraska for a very brief period, and that went back however to No. 43 which carried the same provision, shortly thereafter the Nebraska class - ification was issued and the item was somewhat enlarged, to read, graders, bridge builders and contractors' outfits, in the Nebraska Classification second hand, minimum weight 24,000 pounds class A.

Q. So that cites the first publication of any rating on con - tractors outfits in either Western' Classification or Interstate Contractors outfits and they have always taken Class A rating? ■ A. Yes, sir, over 41 years. The present classification of contractors' outfits in Nebraska as provided in Western Classification, according to an exhibit introduced «by Mr. Driggs, is as follows: WESTERN CLASSIFICATION RATING ON BRIDGE BUILDERS', CONTRACTORS', OR GRADERS' OUTFITS-N. 0. I.B.N.

Shippers may at their option and expense furnish .Male Adult Attendant who upon paying full first class passenger fare shall be permitted to accompany shipments which contain Horses, Mules or Oxen; Uniform Live Stock- Contract to be ex - ecuted. Mr. Driggs also introduced an exhibit that showed that most of the articles loaded in a contractor's outfit are fated new (when shipped alone) higher than class A, which applies on carload shipments of contractors' outfits. Numerous exhibits were introduced by the carriers showing the difference in the interstate and intrastate rates that would result if the Commission authorized the scale as asked for by the complainant; that it was their contention that if such rates were. established by the Nebraska Commission it would have the effect of unjustly discriminat - ing against interstate shipments of contractors' outfits into Nebraska stations. • . CONCLUSIONS It is apparent from the foregoing statement of the testimony in - troduced in this case that complainants rely very largely upon the fact that the states of Oklahoma and Kansas have established lower rates on shipments of contractors' outfits intrastate than are. in effect in Nebraska. The carrier, on the other hand, rests their case very largely upon the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission has given considera - tion to a similar complaint on interstate shipments and found that the complaint should be dismissed. Carriers earnestly contend that if the rates were established as asked for by complainants in this case unjust and unlawful discrimination will in fact exist between interstate and intrastate shipments of contractors' outfits. </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The statements of witnesses for the complainant clearly show that modern contractors' outfits today are a materially different class of shipments as compared with 15 or 20 years; ago, at which time horses mules or oxen were used for motive power; in the hauling of grading outfits. Today such equipment is handled almost altogether by tractor engines. The testimony is conclusive that the provision of the presont classification wherein livestock may be loaded in mixed carload ship - ments of contractors' outfits is not used today in any appreciable extent. It is also clear that the equipment used for paving, road building and general construction of large buildings and general con - struction work is very much heavier per unit now than a number of years ago. All that we have just said justifies the statement that there should be some revision made in the present classification rating and pro - vision so as to bring it more nearly in line with the modern contractors' outfits offered to the carriers for transportation in this state. Ac - cording to the order entered by the Kansas Commission, in regard to Kansas intrastate shipments of contractors'j outfits, it appears to give considerable consideration to the fact that in the state of Missouri the railroads operating in that state voluntarily established a lower rate on carload shipments of contractors' outfits when consigned to state or county representatives to be used for the purpose of constructing public improvements in the way of state highways] In the complaint filed before the Interstate Commission, according to the report of the Commission, it was asked to establish class B on interstate carload shipments of contractors' outfits where loaded without live stock. Complainants in that case appear to justify the lower rating on contractors' outfits not including live stock by com - parison with rates on other commodities moved at lower rates. Such commodities, generally speaking however, were loaded to a materially greater minimum weight than is provided for contractors' outfits. It is not clear in the complaint as to just what class of contractors' outfits complainant sought to have changed by the Commission. The bulk of the testimony related to highway contractors' outfits. Some of the witnesses testified that they did general contracting in the way of highway building, paving and general building jobs. There is a material difference between a highway contractors' outfit and one that is used for the purpose of street paving. speaking bridge building contractors' outfits consist of a different class of equipment than a highway grading outfit. Western Classification No. 60, which is in effect on Nebraska traffic, provides class E for paving contractors' outfits moving on their own wheels (or in other words paving outfits that are constructed on a car as a part of the equipment) at a minimum weight of 60,000 pounds. No testimony was offered by complainants and we do not </seg>
            <seg id="p218">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT .' understand that this provision of the classification is brought before the Commission in this complaint. However, on contractors' - -paving outfits that are not moved on their own wheels are before the Com - mission for its consideration in this complaint. In addition to the paving outfits, bridge building outfits, highway and general building contractors' outfits will be affected by the decision rendered by us in tins case* The following is quoted from the Oklahoma decision heretofore "This Commission has indicated its desire to go along with the Interstate Commerce Commission in an attempt to bring about a uniform adjustment of rates ■within this territory. In our order 4379, issued in Case 8791, on the 31st day of July 1928, we pre - scribed, generally, the interstate rates • published in accordance, with the decision of the Interstate- Commerce Commission in the "Consolidated Southwestern Cases," supra, for intrastate appli - cation. It is anticipated that the surrounding states will ulti - mately take similar action. The commodity involved herein, is one of the so-called "untreated" commodities in the Consolidated Southwestern Cases. By that we mean, it is one of the com - modities on which the Interstate Commerce Commission did not specifically prescribe rates." The Nebraska Commission is also cooperating with the Interstate Commerce Commission in a general investigation of the Class Rates in Western Trunk Line territory, affecting Nebraska state and inter - state traffic, known as Docket No. 17000, Part II.' We are not impressed with the showing. made by the complainants as to the volume of the rates that should be charged on the commodity herein considered. No testimony was introduced of record. that shows whether or not transportation conditions in the states of Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma are similar to the state of Nebraska. The rates that govern the intrastate movements in the states last mentioned are established on different bases. A comparison of the rates taken from the report of the Oklahoma Commission in part, when compared with class C as provided in the Clarke scale, is as follows: Miles 25 50 100 150 200 300 400 500 Oklahoma 1. 20.5 26.5 36.5 45 55 69.5 81.5 2. 10 13 18 . 22 25 , 30 35 3. 13 16 22 27 30 37 43 Arkansas 10 14 17.5 21 25 29.5 33 Missouri 11 13.5 19 23 27.5 33 36.5 Texas 15.5 19 27.5 35 41.5 48.5 54 Kansas 11.5 16.5 21.5 26.5 31.5 36.5 41.5 Nebraska 12 14.5 19.5 24 38.5 35 42 48.5 (Clark Scale) </seg>

Conditions surrounding the transportation of contractors' outfits in Nebraska have changed materially in the- last 15 or 20 years. ' There was a "X W . h , en e st ° ck t . waS an P ar * &lt;* the mixture allowed under the Classification. At the present time, the record is clear that very seldom live stock is included with carload shipments of contractors-outfits. The volume of the traffic in Nebraska has in - creased materially and the prospects f on a [greater increase in the near future is apparent. The Nebraska legislature has recently passed an act which provides for a four-cent per gallon gasoline tax, which will double the amount of money available in Nebraska for highway construction There is an increasing demand! for the paving of high - ways, all of which will tend to materially increase the shipments of contractors outfits. _ The question of minimum weights should be considered in the adjustment of the ratings on contractors' outfits. It is shown by the testimony that the cars are loaded very much heavier now than they used to be. In a tabulation introduced of record showing the actual weight on 36 cars, ranging from 16,200 pounds to 55,600 pounds the average weight of the 36 cars was 28, 334 pounds. . In the o^er entered by the Oklahoma Commission as to contract - ors outfits, _it was provided that rates established would apply on single and joint line shipments. In view of the fact that the Nebraska Commission has not passed upon joint line class rates on Nebraska intrastate traffic, we will not require joint linej application of the rates herein established at this time. This question will be given considera- " tionm Resolution 81, supra. The rates we establish will apply on single line movement only. After a careful consideration of the record in this case, we are of the opinion and so find that the present rates on carload shipments of contractors' outfits, not including live stock, are unreasonably h lg h. We further find that the present classification provision on </seg>
            <seg id="p220">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT carload shipments of contractors' outfits, where live stock may be loaded as a part of the mixture should stand as at present provided.

In the above comparison of rates on contractors' outfits in dif - ferent states as compared with Nebraska, based upon the Clarke scale class C rates, it will be noted that the Nebraska rates would be somewhat higher than the rates in some of the states, and lower 1 than in others. In Formal Complaint No. 609, we said that we were in hearty accord with the Interstate Commission in its attempt to relate all freight rates on a column basis, that is, that the rates for different classes would have a definite relationship to all other classes. We are of the opinion that this plan of adjusting: rates, is a step in the right direction in order to clarify the freight rate situation of the country. For the purpose of deciding this case, we are of the opinion and so find from a careful consideration of the record herein, that Class C should be applied on shipments brought in' review by this complaint. We have reached this decision pending the time when the class rates in Nebraska, state and interstate, have finally been adjusted by rea - son of the investigation in Resolution No. 81 and Docket No. 17000, Part II, supra. We also find that the class C rates as provided under the so - called Clarke scale shall apply between Nebraska stations as reason - able rates on carload shipments of contractors' outfits, not including live stock, as described above. In our order, we will provide that the rates herein established will be retained on our docket for further consideration by the Com - mission, if and when found necessary. .

COMMISSIONER RANDALL PRESIDING </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This case came on for hearing on complaint of the Ash Grove Lame and Portland Cement company, a corporation organized and ex - isting under and by virtue of the laws of the| state of Maine, herein - after called the cement company. Said company is building a large cement mill at Louisville, Nebraska. - Louisville is located on the Platte river,! approximately 22 miles, southwest of Omaha via the Chicago, Rock (Island &amp; Pacific Rail - way Company, hereinafter called the Rock Island; 29 miles by the rails of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, here - inafter called the Missouri Pacific; and 31 |miles from Omaha via . the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, hereinafter called the Burlington. Within recent months the Rock Island has changed the name of its station of Meadow, located on the north side of the Platte River opposite Louisville to Louisville, so at the present time Louisville is served by three railroads, the Burlington, Rock Island and Missouri Pacific. The Missouri Pacific and the Burlington | have direct track con - nections with the plant of the cement company; the Rock Island has connections ■with the cement company tracks. I At the present time there is a case pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission in which the Nebraska Commission is acting in a cooperative manner, known as I. &amp; S. Docket No. 3142. The Mis - souri Pacific is contending that they do not have direct track connect - ions between their line and the Rock Island. This matter has been heard on its merits and a final decision may affect the statement made in the next preceding paragraph as to the Missouri Pacific : and Rock Island. At the time of hearing the rate on carload shipments of cement from Louisville to Omaha was 8% cents per 100 pounds. Complain - ants ask that the. Commission establish a rate of 7y 2 cents per 100 pounds. In support of their prayer they showj that it is the intention of the Ash Grove Lime &amp; Portland Cement Company to incorporate as a subsidiary company under the laws of the state of Nebraska; that under the order entered by the Commission in its Resolution No. 70, it provided a rate one cent less than the distance tariff rates from Superior to Omaha; that Omaha is a large consuming market for cem - ent; that the competition in the price of cement at Omaha is highly competitive; that it is common practice for the carriers to establish rates materially lower than the Interstate Commerce Commission cem- </seg>
            <seg id="p224">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT "&gt; ent scale from cement-producing points to nearby large cities, illust - rated by the following: The Burlington established a rate on carload shipments of cement from Hannibal, Missouri, to St. Louis five cents under the Interstate Commission scale as originally established; by reason of later reductions, the differential now stands at four cents less than the scale of rates in the Interstate Commission scale; that the Rock Island has established a rate of $8.10 per car on carload shipments of cement from Linwood, Iowa, to Davenport; the Interstate Commission distance scale of rates provides a rate of seven cents per . 100 pounds; the Missouri Pacific has established a rate of six cents per 100 pounds less than the Interstate Commission scale from Alpha, Missouri, to St. Louis, Missouri. Complainant shows that at a rate of 7% cents per 100 pounds, minimum weight 50,000 pounds, a car of cement from Louisville to Omaha will earn 68 miles per? ton mile; $1.07 per car mile. On behalf of the defendants, Mr. Hoffelder of the Burlington, showed that it was his understanding that the Nebraska Commission in its decision in Resolution No. 70 established substantially the same rates on carload shipments of cement on Nebraska intrastate traffic as were provided in I. C. C. Docket 8182 for interstate application; that the present rate on carload shipments of cement frtom Superior, Neb., to Omaha is 12% cents per 100 pounds, a distance of 162 miles, which is the rate provided under scale 2; that the rate under scale 3 for 162 miles is 13% cents; that Superior is located in scale 3 territory. Mr. Qeismar offered testimony on behalf of the Missouri Pacific and showed in exhibit form a number of comparisons on carload ship - ments of cement from interstate points to Omaha. Most of his com - parisons dealt with distances very much greater than the distance from Louisville to Omaha. CONCLUSIONS The record shows that rates have been established from cement - producing plants to the nearest large consuming point at a rate less than provided in the scales applying in the different territories. We established a rate one cent less per 100 pounds on carload shipments of cement from Superior to Omaha. From all of the facts introduced of record, we find that a rate of iy% cents on carload shipments of cement, 50,000 pounds minimum, from Louisville to Omaha is a reasonable rate. An appropriate order will therefore be entered. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, </seg>

OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: (Hearing in this case was held in the Chamber of Commerce rooms at Wahoo, at the hour of 9:00 a. m. o'clock, on March 27, 1929. Not - ices had previously been served on interested! parties. </seg>
            <seg id="p226">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT This complaint was made by Chauncey E. Beadle and Conard Johnson, both being citizens and tax -payers of Saunders County; that the Union Pacific Railroad Company had lowered their roadbed and tracks so that it caused a dip of from seven to eight feet below the nat - ural level of the highway, which made the crossing very dangerous. The railroad crosses Highway No. 77 between section 34 and 35, town - ship 15, north of range 7, east of the sixth P. ML at right angles, and approaches the highway from the west in a" deep cut so that trains from the southwest are obstructed from the view of the traveling public on the highway, by reason of this deep cut and also the spoil dirt. On the north and west side of said railroad there is a snow fence which also obstructs the view, so that trains can not be seen until you are within 10 or 15 feet from the tracks of said railroad. Tr&amp;ins coming from the east can be seen for a. long distance by the traveling public when going south, but the view is somewhat; obstructed by banks of dirt when going north and trains can not be seen, until a vehicle is within about 100 feet of the crossing. The railroad company has installed an electric wigwag at the crossing, which has been in use for some years and to those living adjacent to the crossing who have knowledge of the condition this has been a deterrent against serious accidents. Highway No. 77 is the main highway between Lincoln, Fremont and Omaha and points north and east of Lincoln, and is extensively travelled by tourists. A count by the federal highway department shows that average daily traffic for seven days in August, 1928, was 853 and at the Junction of 77 and 16, the average was 1,053. The testimony of A. T. Lobdell, chief of bureau of roads and bridges of . department of public works, shows that he personally, and the depart - ment he represented, considered the railroad crossing complained of as very dangeiVms and ought to be eliminated, either by a viaduct or relocation of the highway. He further testified, that if the highway could be relocated com - mencing at a point north of the crossing in question, thence south - west paralleling the Union Pacific Railroad tracks across Sand Creek, and thence west through Wahoo to a point to connect with Chestnut Street, it would not only eliminate the crossing in question but would also eliminate the Union Pacific Railroad crossing at the east city limits of Wahoo. The department of public works was of the opinion that the highway should be relocated as it is more practical and much less expensive than a viaduct and would eliminate two dangerous cros - sings, shorten the distance and -would make less maintenance cost to the federal and state highway departments, as well as relieving the rail - road company of the expense of erecting and maintaining a viaduct.; Testimony of W. L. Bray ton, bridge engineer, for the Union Pacific Railroad Company was, that a 24 foot roadway viaduct would cost </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION $35,000 and that a 20 foot roadway viaduct would cost $22,uuu to construct. That would include the grading, structure and guard rails. Mr. W. M. Jeff ers, vice president of operation for the Union Pacific Railroad Company testified that if the highway was relocated follow - ing along the north and west side of the Union Pacific right of way from the crossing in question,' that it would eliminate the principal, volume of traffic over two crossings and greatly reduce the hazard and remove the necessity for a' viaduct at either crossing. The ex - pense both to the railroad company and the highway department would be materially less and there would not be a continual expense of up - keep of the viaduct, and would be much more economical, and that the Union Pacific R. R. Company would agree to furnish the right of way in lieu of the viaduct, providing the highway department would do the grading, surfacing, etc. Mr. Frank Houfek, county commissioner of Saunders County, testified that the county commissioners had left the matter entirely in the hands of the state highway department but he considered it advis - able to eliminate the two grade crossings, if it could be done without too much expense to the county. That the county commissioners had left the matter of relocating the road in the hands of the state highway department and that the proposed routing of the road to meander on the north and west side of the Union Pacific right of way would be satisfactory and a valuable change in the interest of safety and con - venience and that the county board would approve payment from their share of state and. federal road funds, toward the expense as it was a county, state and federal road, the amount of such expense to be determined by the state highway department. ■ - It seemed to be the consensus of opinion' of all interested parties present, that the most economical, effectual, fair and sensible solution of the matter was to abandon the idea of a 'viaduct and relocate the highway along the north and west side of the right of way of the Union Pacific Railroad, commencing just north of where said railroad crosses Highway 77, between sections 34 and 35, to a point directly east of Twelfth street, connecting said highway with Twelfth street in the city .of Wahoo; then running due west to! Chestnut street, to con - nect with the present highway. In order that the department of public works and the Union Pacific Railroad Company could come to an agreement in the matter, the Commission made the following entry in the record: "The Commission will withhold their decision for thirty days in the findings in this case and give the Union Pacific and High - way Department time to get together and furnish the Commission with a stipulation signed, sealed and delivered and ready to be used in the deciding of this case. If the stipulation is satis - factory to the Commission, it will be accepted and made a part of the order; if not, ruling will be made on the testimony taken in the case.". </seg>
            <seg id="p228">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT On May 13th, 1929, the following stipulation signed by the Union Pacific Railroad Company and R. L. Cochran, secretary of the depart - ment of public works, was delivered to the Railway Commission and same was accepted by the Commission as a satisfactory, just and equitable solution to the complaint. STIPULATION "It is hereby stipulated by and between Union Pacific Rail - road Company and the Department of Public "Works as follows: The Department of Public Works, and other public authori - ties will relocate the highway described in the complaint herein so that the same will extend along the northerly side of the rail - road right of way from the crossing complained of in the com - plaint to Twelfth Street in the city of Wahoo, and will acquire all land necessary for so relocating said highway in the usual manner, and do. all necessary work to relocate and improve said highway. Union Pacific Railroad Company will pay the Department of Public Works a sum equal to the cost of the land necessary for relocating the highway, which amount is hereby agreed upon as Union Pacific Railroad Company's total contribution toward the cost of relocating said highway.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this fifteenth day of May, 1929. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, John E. Curtiss, Chairman. Attest: Hugh Drake, Secretary. (SEAL) ■ FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 634 L. R. Rudd, Complainant, v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, Defendant. Appearances : For the complainant — L. R. Rudd, highway commissioner. For the defendant — Chas. F. McLaughlin, attorney, J. Davis, superintendent. . For the Commission — Hugh Drake, secretary. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: .*■ This action occurred upon the formal complaint of L. R. Rudd, highway commissioner of Clay County, against the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company on account of a hazardous and dangerous crossing where the said railway crosses the highway between Sections 30 and 31, township 5 north, range 8 "west, in Clay County. Hearing was held in the court house in the county commissioners' room at Clay Center, at 11:00 a. in. on the 11th day of April, 1929, that being the time and place specified in the notice to the citizens! of Clay County and the defendant railway company. Mr. L. R. Rudd, complainant, and county supervisors of the county were present and represented the complainant. Charles F. McLaughlin, attorney, and J. Davis, superintendent of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company appeared for the defendant. Mr. Hugh Drake, secretary of the State Railway Commission appeared for the Commission. The testimony in this case shows that the crossing in question is a dangerous and hazardous crossing as represented in the complaint. </seg>
            <seg id="p230">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT i • ' . . ... The public road, running east and west, which crosses the railroad at that point, indicated in the complaint, is just an ordinary country road and not a state or federal highway; owing to that fact it is not tra - versed extensively by non-residents and tourists, but is used quite extensively by the people living in that vicinity in passing from their farms to the market and tributary towns. Testimony shows a count by the railroad company made on March 21, 1929, that there were 13 cars and teams crossed, the rail- - road at that crossing. The testimony of complainant was that March was not a fair time to make the count and that in his judgment there would be at least from 18 to 27 automobiles and teams cross the rail - road at that point each twenty-four hours during. the months of May, June, July, August and September. The view from the highway of the railroad on the north side of the highway is not obstructed so that there is no danger practically from that side, but on the south side of the highway the railroad is on a curve and also a down grade of 1.2 per cent toward the highway crossing. The banks on each side of the railroad track range from seven feet above the top of the rail at a point 100 feet from the center of the crossing; 13 feet at a point 200 feet; 20 feet at 300 feet; 23 feet, 400 feet from the crossing, and at a point 500 feet up the track the banks are 27 feet high. These banks entirely exclude .the view of a train coming from the south to a person on the highway going in either direction on the highway. The fact that this is a down grade,' the engine or motor does not make much of any noise, and, being in a deep cut, the sound of the whistle or the bell can. not be heard by automobile drivers, especially in an enclosed car. Testimony shows that trains are being run down through this cut across the highway at a rate of speed as high as from 20 to 25 miles per hour; that if a person was driving a car at 20 or 25 miles an hour in either direction on that road, he could not see an approaching train from the south until he was oh the railroad right-of-way a distance of 50 feet from the center of the track, and that it would be impossible for the driver of the car to stop and prevent an accident, in case a train should he coming out of the cut on the south side of the highway. Coming from the west, there is a slight up grade in the highway, but from the east it is a down grade and the soil is a slippery clay soil. In case it should be at all moist or wet, so that if the driver of a car would set his brakes the car would undoubtedly slide onto the tracks of the railroad and a bad accident might be the result. However, it was testified to by the complainant and witnesses for the complainant, one of whom had lived there for 42 years, that they had never known or heard of an accident at this crossing. This crossing is located 23 miles from Clay Center and about 12 or 13 miles from Fairfield. These are the only towns of any size </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION near the crossing. Towns tributary thereto; are very small and just market towns or trading points. They are used by the citizens living tributary to the point where this crossing is j located. From the testi - mony it is shown that the crossing is used extensively by citizens living tributary thereto but as already stated, not extensively by non-resi - dents or tourists. The question of how best io make this crossing safe for the traveling public was thoroughly gone into by jthe testimony of not only the complainants, but of the defendant and the facts adduced from the complainants were that the railroad company should be required to provide an electric wig-wag signal or "remove the banks of dirt on both sides of the track back a sufficient so that a train approaching would be visible to the public Ion the highway. It was shown by the testimony of Superintendent! Davis that the cost of removing the banks on both sides of the right-of-way east of the highway for a distance that would give a sufficient view of the trains approaching from the south, would be from $4,000.00 to $10,000.00. That the cost of installing an electric signal would range from $900.00 to $1,500.00 and that the cost of up keep of the electric signal would be approximately $15.00 a month. Also as there are no electric lines any where near this crossing, it would be necessary to equip the signal with storage batteries. Mr. Davis testified that there was one freight train each way per day and one motor car each way per day and that the time these trains crossed this highway was between the hours of 10:00 a. m. and 1:00 p. m. That as a precautionary measure the engineers and motormen had been given strict instructions to go over this crossing at a speed not to exceed 10 miles per hour as the railroad company considers it dangerous, providing trains pass over the crossing faster than 10 miles per hour. As has already been stated the- speed ofj trains over this crossing as testified to by witnesses has ranged from 20 to 25 miles per hour, ■which according to Superintendent Davis testimony was a violation of the rules of the company and which Mr. Davis said would be rectified and the rules would be rigidly enforced in the future. ■• I This line of road known as the Prosser Branch, is not extensively used by the company, there being only. two |trains each way per day and as the business of the road is not profitable enough to warrant the expenditure of a great amount of money by the company, and there are no prospects of more trains on this branch soon, the Commission does not feel that the company should be subjected to the expense of the removal of the banks of dirt on their right-of-way south of the highway, nor do they feel that the company should be subjected to the expense of installing an electric signal at |a cost of approximately $1,200.00, and then a perpetual expense of; $15.00 a month for the supervision and upkeep of the signal. But the Commission does feel </seg>
            <seg id="p232">TWENTY- SECOND ANNUAL EEPORT that the railroad company should be required to make this crossing as safe as possible in order to prevent a serious accident. It is the opinion o£ the Commission that trains from the south approaching this crossing should be slowed down to a speed not to exceed five miles per hour and that a large sign should be placed at least 150 feet on each side of the track on the highway, calling the attention of the traveling public to the fact that the railroad crossing 150 feet ahead of them is a dangerous crossing. That there should be placed on this sign in letters large enough to be readily discernible by the traveling public, the following "Dangerous R. R. Crossing, Stop, Look, Listen". That the same sign that is at the crossing at the present time shall be left in its position in addition to the sign above mentioned. That the engineer and motorman be required to sound, their crossing signals continuously after entering the cut until after the highway is crossed. . ' The Commission believes that if these rules axe put into effect that an accident at this crossing will be averted and the crossing made as, safe as the average grade crossing, and the safety of the public will be adequately guarded. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company be, and the same is hereby ordered to install a warning sign on each side of the railroad track where the said Missouri Pacific Railroad crosses the public highway between Sections 30 and 31, Township 5 North, Range 8 West, Clay County, Nebraska. That signs shall be placed 150 feet from the crossing on the right hand side of the highway approaching the crossing from the east or west, and same shall be of sufficient size to have plainly printed on them the words "Dangerous R. R. Cross - ing, Stop, Look, Listen". IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that trains operated by the said Missouri Pacific Railroad Company shall not cross said crossing at a speed in excess of five miles per hour from the south. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that said railroad company shall require the engineer and motorman to commence the sounding of cross - ing signal at least 500 feet south of said crossing and continue to sound the same each 100 feet until they have crossed said highway.

            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION FORMAL COMPLAINT 110. 637 Drayton Brothers, Complainants, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendants. Appearances: ■ For the complainant— H. H. Drayton. For the defendant— L. B. Lyman, general superintenden ;, J; W. Weingarten, attorney, L. E. CaldweJJ, division superintendent. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: I» the matter of the application of Dray on Brothers for an under - ground stock pass on their 400 acre farm, which is bi-sected by the t. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company about one and cne-half miles west of the town of Orchard, m Antelope County. Hearing was held on this ap - plication at Orchard, on the 13th day of June, 1929. Previous to the hearing being held, Commissioner Randall m company with H. H. Drayton, Superintendent L. B. Lyman, Division Superintendent L. E. Caldwell, J. W. Weingi rten, attorney and W.- H. iiiker, engineer, made a personal inspection oi the place where applicant desired the underground pass to be located. At the particular point designated by Mr. Drayton where he desired this underground pass, the grade of the railroad is about 5y 2 | op 6| feet high. At this point there seems to be a sort of basin, as the lay of the ground slopes m each direction toward the point where applicant desired the under - ground pass. The applicant asks for a six-foot cattle pass and as the com - pany requires at least 2% or 3 feet of soil asja track cushion above the pass, for safety of operation of trains and protection of the con - crete pipe, and as the thickness of the concrete pipe that forms the pass is from seven to eight inches thick, m order to install one of these passes so that it would be practicable and m accordance with the rules of the company, it would be necessary that the grade be at least 10 or 11 feet high, and as this grade is only 5% or 6 feet, it would be necessary to excavate on both sides of the right of way at least four or five feet m order to' install the pass. This would make a very un - favorable condition on both sides of the track, as all drainage would run down into the cattle pass and on account of the pass having a concrete floor, water would not- seep away and the floor of the cattle pass would be muddy m the summer time and icy m the winter, so </seg>
            <seg id="p234">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT it would make an impracticable and unsatisfactory condition. There is no way of draining this water in either direction as has already been said, the point where this pass is desired is sort of a basin and is not subject to being drained: The railroad company's rule in placing these passes is to put the bottom of the pass high enough so it will not act as a drainage tube, but where necessary for drainage they place a pipe of sufficient capacity to carry off the drainage water, placing that below the base of the underground pass. This prevents the pass from becoming muddy or icy by reason of water passing through it. The provision of the law governing crossings, is that where a railroad company divides a piece of land they shall furnish at least one adequate crossing. The company has furnished a grade crossing west of the location where the underground pass is desired, where applicant can drive across with teams, or drive his cattle across. This crossing has proven to be adequate for the purpose for which it was intended. The buildings on the land are located on the east line adjacent to a public road. Applicant' has been driving his cattle along the public road, across the railroad track, onto this land or across the railroad at a point where the present grade crossing is located. The land in question is into crop and is not used as pasture during the summer season, but it is the desire of applicant to pasture the corn stalks after the corn has been harvested. The railroad company offered to move the present grade crossing to a point further east more adjacent to the corrals and buildings of the applicant, and install cattle guards and wing fences, so that applicant could drive his cattle across the track more conveniently than where the present crossing is located and the crossing could also be used by applicant in driving across with loads, or with farm machinery. Ap - plicant did not seem to desire this change, but insisted on the under - ground pass being installed at the point designated by him. The experience the railroad company has had with underground passes, where it has been necessary to excavate in order to install them, even though there were drainage facilities on the lower side of the land to carry off the water, have not been satisfactory, unless, it was possible to put in a drainage pipe below the floor of the under - ground pass. The railroad company also suggested that in order to install a pass where applicant desired, that it would be necessary. to raise the grade at that point, which according to an itemized statement furnished by the company to the Commission, would entail a cost of $4,259. Under the law, the railroad company is required to stand the first $700 of the expense, the balance to be borne equally by the rail - road company and the land owner. This would leave an amount of $1,779.50 which would have to be borne by the applicant, which in the judgment of the Commission is excessive and an unreasonable amount for applicant to pay. </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING CURT1SS, Chairman: V \ This action originates upon formal complaint of^SchefeeTg^and &amp; Gravel Company, the name of complainant subsequent to the filing of complaint being changed to Schellberg-Fremont Sand &amp; Gravel Company, against the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, respecting certain rates on sand and gravel from its pits west of Fre - mont on defendant's lines, to Omaha and Lincoln. Complainant will hereinafter be referred to as complainant, or Schellberg company, and defendant, as defendant, or North Western. Hearing upon complaint was originally held at Commission offices July 8, 1929, the above noted appearances being present. Subsequent thereto, upon petition of Trenmor Cone, owner of sand and gravel pits, the matter was reopened and further hearing was held at Commission offices on July 30, 1929. General notice of the reopening of the case was given to all miners of sand and gravel and all carriers, and appear-, ances were made as above noted. • Complainant owns a sand and gravel pit 7.1 miles east of Morse Bluff, 1.9 miles west of Platte River Junction, a junction point only, but carried in defendant's official table of .distances, 8.9 miles west of Fremont, 45.4- miles from Omaha, and 46.9 miles from Lincoln.

The complaint alleges discrimination in that from the Lyman-Richey pit above referred to, 2.8 miles east of complainant's pit, a rate of three " cents per cwt. to Omaha and Lincoln and intermediate points, is collected; also, that from other pits of approximately the same or even peater distance from Omaha and Lincoln as is complainant's pit the three-cent rate to these points is published and collected. It is alleged that sand and gravel are low grade commodities; that com - petition is keen, and that a rate disadvantage of one-half cent per cwt. is a complete deterrent to complainant in competing for business atUmaha, Lincoln and intermediate points thereto. Complainant lavs particular stress on the fact that its pit is less than 50 miles from either Omaha or Lincoln; also, that there are other pits enjoying- the three-cent Omaha-Luicoln rate which are located in excess of 50 miles irom these important markets. : Respondent Cone asnwers that in the establishment of the three - cent rate from certain pits to Omaha and Lincoln and intermediate points, no consideration was given to distance; that at the time of the establishment of this rate in 1921 by the Nebraska Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission, the threefcent zone was established taking in all pits then in actual competition for Omaha and Lincoln business; that the purpose of the establishment of this zone was that investment m pits as of that time might be protected, and that all pits then operating might compete on even (terms for the business at these two important markets; that the zone followed the Platte river in Nebraska and extended from competitor's pit above referred to, west of Jremont, easterly to Oreapolis; also, that there was a gentlemen's agreement entered into at ; the time of Establishment of the rate schedule, by the carriers, shippers and state and federal Commissions that the zone should not be disturbed by enlargement; that to permit complainant to enter the so-called three-ceni zone territory would only add to what is already "too much competition in that proposition for the busmess that there is now"; and further, that to grant the com - plaint would break down the entire sand arid gravel rate structure in the state. Representatives of the carriers each entered opposition to the </seg>
            <seg id="p238">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT granting of complainant's request, voicing in substance the same ob - jections presented .by respondent Cone. Harrison M. Smith of the traffic department of the Lincoln Cham - ber of Commerce, expressed approval of complainant's request in that it would result in increased competition, with possible favorable re - suits to the consuming public. . ■ Mr. Lobdell of the department of public works of the state of Nebraska, while expressing no conclusions as to the merits of the case, stated that that department "was interested in any rate that would provide more competition in the gravel business". CONCLUSIONS The Commission realizes that in determining the issues of this case, it has before it a principle of rate making that involves more than the particular rates in question. However, the question is not a new one, for on at least three different occasions, the same problem has been before it. In Formal Complaint No. 508, Moffitt Sand &amp; Gravel Company v. C. &amp; N. W. Railway Company, the Commission had before it the rate on Band and gravel from a pit west of Fremont, more than 50 miles and less than 60 miles from Omaha and Lincoln. Complainant re - quested a three-cent rate. Defendant alleged the four-cent rate under the mileage scale, was proper. The Commission ordered a rate of 3% cents to these two markets and intermediate points, this being one-half cent under the mileage scale. In Formal Complaint No. 513, Platte Valley Gravel Company of Schuyler, v. Union Pacific, complainant requested a three-cent rate on sand and gravel to Omaha and to Lincoln, a distance of more than 50 miles to each destination. The Commission adopted the principle laid down in the Moffitt case, supra, and ordered the carrier to establish rates in conformity with that principle, that is, one-half cent under the mileage scale. Again, in Application No. 6076, being a request of Rock Island to increase from three cents to four cents, rates on sand and gravel from Fair bury to Lincoln, a distance of more than 50 miles and less than 60 miles, the Commission adhered to the principle laid down in the above two mentioned cases, pointed out that in line with that principle the rate should be 3%, cents, and denied the request. In Application No. 7070, the Bock Island again requested authority to establish a four-cent rate on sand and gravel from Fairbury to Lincoln. The request was denied, the Commission in its order therein, saying: </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "It is conceded that the three-cent rate now in efi BUl i8 not in harmony with the scale applicable on the commodities involved nor is the rate which applicant requests in harmony therewith The present rate is no [greater a violation of the scale which the Nebraska Commission has adopted, than is the rate which earner herein proposes, j As stated above, it is the one exception to the rates under th&lt;j scale. Under the circum - stances, the Commission does not feel that its existence need establish a precedent which menaces the entire rate structure ap - plicable to the commodity in question. It might be said with equal force that the four-cent rate proposed would establish a similar menace." It will be noted that in each of these cases the Commission found proper a rate to Omaha and Lincoln one-half cent under the mileage scale. .Camera, and shippers who assume Sthat in the past this Com - mission had provided specific rates to thk two markets, Omaha and Lincoto, for only a selected list of sand aid gravel pits, are in error. This has never been the attitude of the Nebraska Commission and no good reasons have been presented why it should reverse itself now. _; Carrier representatives and respondent Cone viewed with alarm the granting of complainant's request, in that to do so would result m breaking down the entire sand and gravel rate structure in Nebraska. . bimilar alarm has been previously expressed by the carriers in cas s above cited. The establishment of the principle and the actual publica - tion of the rate, have not in the past broken down the rate struotur u omnussion sees n ° reason why a continuance of the princip e should do so now. Such action does not create confusion; rather does it follow precedent and makes for clearer understanding. The Commission is not impressed with ihe importance of respond - ent tone s reference to a gentlemen's agreement entered into by the carriers, shippers, and state and federal commissions at the time of issuance of the original order establishing the present sand and gravel rate structure in Nebraska, such agreement providing that the three - cent Omaha-Lincoln territory should never be disturbed. Such an agreement, would not, of course, be a matteij of record, and the present Nebraska Commission has no knowledge of any such understanding except as it is presented by Mr. Cone and referred to by carriers' re - presentatives. Certainly any such understanding as may have existed can have no binding force or effect in the consideration of this case' The. issues must be decided in accordance with statutory requirements and a proper determination of equities. ' The Commission does not believe" that j in the building of a rate structure, controlling consideration should be given to the protection of investment, through the medium of restricting competition by means of rate handicaps not otherwise justifiable. I </seg>
            <seg id="p240">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Undoubtedly, at the time of the original establishment of what is known as the 3-cent s^one, mileage was not a controlling factor in its determination. In fact, it was unnecessary to give consideration to mileage in reaching conclusions. The zone included all Platte river pits actually competing for Omaha-Lincoln business. It is difficult to believe that it was contemplated by those ex - ercising authority, that a rate wall should be built up around this particular territory and that, it should for all time to come, enjoy to the exclusion of all others, the 3-cent rate. Subsequent to the date of issuance of the original order estab - lishing the sand and gravel rate structure in Nebraska, there has been a most rapid development of the industry within the state. In recent years, the state of Nebraska has been spending millions of dollars in graveling and paving its highways. It is fair to presume that this will continue for many years. This rapid growth and development of the industry makes important the question of the rate fabric which has been previously before the Commission in cases above cited, and in this case. In line with the principle enunciated in previous cases herein mentioned, the Commission finds that the specific rate in the instant case, should be one-half cent under the mileage rate. Complainant's petition carries, no prayer for reparation, in that the filing of same, and hearings upon the complaint, were held prior to actual movement of sand and gravel from this pit. In line with the findings herein, it is the Commission's opinion that application should be filed by defendant carrier requesting authority to make reparation to complainant herein on a basis of the difference between the rate actually collected and the rate herein directed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company be, and the same is hereby directed to publish and collect in its proper tariffs, a rate of 3-cents per cwt. from pits of Schellberg-Fremont Sand &amp; Gravel Company, located approximately 1.9 miles west of Platte River Junction, and approximately 7.1 miles east of Morse Bluff, to Omaha and Lincoln and intermediate points.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This action originates upon formal complaint of W. H. Bechtel of Pawnee City, against Chicago, Burlington &amp;j Quincy Railroad Company, wherein it is alleged "that the rates on carload shipments of grapes from Pawnee City, Nebraska, to Nebraska! stations are unreasonably high and as compared with the rates in effect from Brownville, Ne - braska, to the same stations are preferential to Brownville and there - fore unlawful.." Answer of defendant carrier is in the nature of a general denial. Hearing upon complaint was held at the Commission offices, September 23, 1929, the above noted appearances being made. At the time of .hearing, there being no objection, the complaint was amended to include prayer for reparation on shipments moved at that time dur - ing 1929. ..-:'•■ Complainant owns a 20-acre grape vineyard near Pawnee City, the same being planted in 1924. This yearjis the first year that pro - duction has been of any consequence, the vines not bearing much during the first four or five years. Some seven or eight carloads of grapes were picked from these vines this fall. At the time of hearing, two cars had actually been marketed, one going to Cambridge, Ne - braska, and the other going to Me Cook, Nebraska. Complainant ad - vised that one other carload had actually been sold, but was not able to state definitely as to whether he was going to be able to market the remaining grapes. Complainant also pointed out that thelsoil and climate in south - east Nebraska, and particularly Pawnee County, is ideally adapted to the production of a fine quality of grapes; also, that there were several other vineyards in the county -which would be in a position shortly, </seg>
            <seg id="p242">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT to market grapes commercially and in carload quantity; that in his opinion an important grape industry was in process of being' built up in Pawnee County if not stifled by an unfavorable rate. It was his-, thought that with a rate structure which would permit of competition with other growers in southeast Nebraska, from 12 to 18 carloads of grapes would be marketed annually in the immediate future from the territory tributary to Pawnee City, and that these shipments would increase in amount constantly from year to year. Complainant had attempted to market his grapes himself, in in - stance, and in addition had one salesman on the road. He contends, that the alleged discriminatory rate preferential to Brownville growers, is almost a complete deterrent to the sale of grapes marketed from Pawnee City, the purchaser buying on a basis of the Brownville rate, and the spread between the Brownville rate and the Pawnee City rate being so great as to make it unprofitable to the Pawnee grower to. absorb the difference. . . While complainant recognized competition from several grape - growing territories, the Commission will confine its discussion to the- Brownville relationship, since this involves the only intrastate rates, mentioned and since that relationship was directly referred to in the complaint itself. In Formal Complaint No. 611, being an action, of the Brownville Fruit Growers Association against C. B. &amp; Q. R. R.. Co. (21 N. S. R. C. Reports 17C-179) this Commission directed the estab - lishment of a rate on grapes from Brownville to Nebraska stations, of' "50 per cent of the first class rate now in effect from Brownville, Nebraska, to other Nebraska stations, minimum weight 24,000 pounds."' The comparison of present rates on grapes from Brownville and Pawnee - to three representative Nebraska stations referred to by complainant, as grape consuming points, with distances, is as follows: From To Distance Rate (per cwt.) Brownville Cambridge 2-74 53c McCook . 300 55V 2 c Scottsbluff 506 76c Pawnee Cambridge 233 . 65c McCook 258 78c Scottsbluff . 490 110y 2 c Applying these comparisons, it is noted that Brownville has a. rate advantage of 12 cents per cwt. to Cambridge; 22y 2 cents per cwt. to McCook and 34y 2 cents per cwt. to Scottsbluff, under Pawnee- City. Furthermore, in each of- these instances, Pawnee City has a lesser mileage than Brownville. It is true the record in Formal Complaint 611, supra, shows a considerable volume of movement of grapes from Brownville, there- </seg>
            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION being raised in 1927 by members of the Bro-wnviHe Fruit Growers Association, 50 carloads of grapes of which 44 carloads were shipped, approximately one-half of this number being in intrastato commerce. The Commission recognizes that commodity rates should not be established from every station to cover possible occasional movements of some commodity. .It has held that volume of movement is an important factor in directing the establishment of commodity rates. However, in the instant case, while volume of movement at the parti - cular moment is not great, the conclusion is reached that rates from Pawnee City should be on a parity with rates from Brownville. With - out this parity of rates, the rate handicap which Pawnee producers suffer is so great as to stifle the industry in its inception. It is reasonable to assume that the industry in this particular territory will develop into an important one. Conditions are ideal for its rapid growth and the development in recent years, undoubtedly is a precur - sor'of. what will take place in the immediate future. Encouragement should be given this development to the point of a parity of rates with other competitors in the same part of Nebraska. In its order in Formal Complaint No. (ill, supra, the Commission discussed in detail the circumstances and conditions which it felt justified the Brownville rate of "50 per cent of the first class rate." Accordingly, it pretermits discussion of that matter in this finding. The question of proper minimum weight was not discussed in the hearing. Accordingly, the minimum weight requirement will be made the same as in the Brownville order. For these reasons, it is found that rates on grapes from Pawnee City as compared with rates on the same commodity from Brownville to Nebraska stations, are unjustly discriminatory and unduly pre - ferential; furthermore, that reparation on such shipments as moved in 1929 should be made on a basis of the rates herein directed. : ■ i ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quinoy Railroad Company be, and the same is hereby ordered and directed to establish, effective not later than March 1, 1930, a rate on grapes from Pawnee City to Nebraska stations, 50 per cent of the first class rate now in effect from Pawnee City, Nebraska, to other Nebraska stations, minimum weight 24,000 pounds.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This matter was heard at Whitney, December 11, 1928, upon the application of the Whitney Telephone Exchange for authority to dis - continue service to Crawford, at present furnished service station sub - scribers of the Whitney exchange. There were present at the hearing spokesmen for all interested- subscribers. The Whitney exchange was formerly operated by the Northwest - ern Bell Telephone Company who sold the plant to Ben Braithwaite, the present owner and manager, who has continued, in the main, the rates and service of the predecessor company. The Whitney exchange is located approximately twelve miles from Crawford with -which it is connected by a grounded circuit iron trunk line, over which the service above referred to is furnished. In addi - tion thereto, there has recently been constructed a new copper circuit between Crawford and Whitney which is used exclusively for toll pur - poses. Both the trunk and toll circuits are owned and maintained by the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company who also owns and operates the exchange at Crawford. The trunk line service is avail - able to Whitney service stations only at $3.00 per annum. If the flat rate service to Crawford was not available patrons would be obliged to use the regular toll service at 15 cents station to station rate and 25 cents person to person. Applicant serves 78 subscribers, 15 of which are residence sub - scribers, 9 business subscribers, 15 are company owned rural stations and 39 are service stations. Twenty-eight of the 39 service stations to whom the Crawford service is available are subscribers to the service. In support of the application, the owner of the Whitney Tele - phone Exchange testified that he receives no compensation for fur- </seg>

STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION iiishiiig the Crawford service since he is merely acting as agent for the owner of the trunk line and remits the! full amounts charged tor the service to the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company. The Com - mission does not have before it the question as to the- adequacy of rates', but has only to consider whether or not certain service shall be discontinued. The' remedy for inadequate rates is not in the abandonment of the service. Applicant further complained of its inability to police the calls placed to Crawford since all of the subscribers on the service station farm lines are not at present required to ' subscribe to the Crawford service. ■■-"'■ . ' ■ Applicant further alleged that Whitney is a self-supporting village which has adequate trading facilities and I that there is no need of Crawford service from the standpoint of a; trade center. This test - imony was contradicted by the' protestants [who pointed out that the proximity of the Whitney exchange to Crawford did not permit of much expansion on the part of its merchants and the farmers found it necessary to rely upon neighboring localities for many of their implement repairs and farm machinery. Protestants also testified that there was no resident doctor in Whitney. The record also dis - closes that some of the farmers now receiving the Crawford service live south and west of Whitney and do considerable trading at Craw - ford." The applicant, also presented an exhibit purporting to show from an experience covering only five days that some subscribers make much greater use of the Crawford service than others, applicant con - tending that the subscriber who does not use the service but a small amount is paying a portion of the revenue which should be borne, by ; the subscriber who makes the most use of the service. This feature was not complained of in any manner by the protestants who appeared to be in unanimous agreement that the service should be continued on the present basis. ■ Protestants testified that approximately twenty years ago a con - tract was entered into between the service station subscribers and the i then owner of the Crawford telephone exchange whereby it was agreed that telephone service should be furnished them at a stipulated rate and giving them, the protestants, the privilege of Crawford service. Having this contract in mind applicant made this statement : . " . . . if they (referring to the Nebraska State Railway Commission), recognized this twenty year contract, the contract expires the first of January this year. Now if that expires it should automatically put them on a 'toll basis. They are on a toll basis after that contract expires, if the Commission re - cognizes that contract." : ■.'■'- - ', </seg>
            <seg id="p248">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT In 1924 the Commission held a hearing upon the application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company (No. 5390) (17 N. S. R. C. Reports 343-347) which had to do with rates and service at Whit - ney. At that time the question was raised as to the validity of the contract above referred to by applicant. Quoting from the Commis - sion's opinion and finding, on page 2 thereof, we find the following language: "Respondents laid special stress on the fact that in 1911 they entered into a contract with applicant's predecessor, under which agreed rates were to be charged. This same question was passed on by the Commission in 1918 and was considered again in 1919. The contract was made after rates and service were under the jurisdiction of the Commission and under the holding of the supreme court (Marquis vs. Polk County Telephone Company 100 Nebr. 140) were made subject to amendment by the state. The rates have three times been amended since that contract was entered into." It is obvious, therefore, that the Commission did not consider the contract as binding, but rather the consideration that was given it was from the standpoint of the service established and the com - pany's obligation to serve the subscribers. The Commission found in its order No. 5390, supra, heretofore re - ferred to, that the Whitney exchange did not serve a sufficient number of subscribers to pay expenses and a fair return upon applicant's investment and that the exchange should perhaps never have been es - tablished, but rather service should have been rendered over party lines from the Crawford switchboard. The Commission at that time, no doubt, recognized that the Crawford exchange was essential to the Whitney service station subscribers. It must be presumed that applicant purchased this property with a thorough familiarity with the size of the exchange and the financial problems which surround the operation of a small exchange, also that he was familiar with the service that was being rendered certain classes of subscribers under order of this Commission. The Commission recognizes the fact that the trunk line between Whitney and Crawford would be of no use if the Crawford sen-ice were discontinued. As a consequence, the line would probably be re - moved. There is no record of the position which the owner of the line the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, would take in this matter This trunk line was originally built for toll purposes but has since been abandoned for the purposes of toll and is now used exclusively for the benefit of the Whitney service station subscribers. The Commission's conclusions are as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION (1) That applicant's remedy for possible inadequate com - pensation for its part in rendering the service herein com - plained of should not be the denial of this established ser - vice but rather should be effected through rate adjustment arid / or an agreement with the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone Company upon the division of the revenue. (2) That the Northwestern Bell] Telephone Company should be made a party to any proceedings which involve the abandonment of any of its property. (3) That applicant's complaint; as to its inability to pro - perly police service station messages -through its switch - board to Crawford is well founded and the same should be satisfied by requiring every subscriber, if any, on each service station line to subscribe to the Crawford service. (4) That even though it might be proven that a few of the service station subscribers make much greater use of the Crawford service than others, the fact would not be - proof of discrimination or inequality of rates since quantum of service is only one of many factors in determining rates. i An order will be entered in accordance with these findings.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this (service, if furnished, shall be subscribed to by all patrons on any particular service station line, the question of whether or not such service shall be received to be determined by the subscribers themselves in such manner as may be provided by the constitution and by laws or rules and regulations of the farm line company. .

' OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This action arises on an application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, hereinafter referred to as the Burling - ton or applicant, wherein authority is requested to cancel a reciprocal switching rate of '$6.30 per car from a sand pit located near Woodcliff to track connections with other lines at Fremont. Hearing upon the application was held at Commission's offices on May 17, 1928. The subject matter has to do with the question of what is a proper rate to apply on movements of sand and gravel from sand pit, across the Platte River from Fremont, located adjacent to what applicant calls Woodcliff, into Fremont. This pit, owned by Sand- Gravel Company, hereinafter referred to as respondents, was put in operation in May, 1917. The switching rate in question was author - ized by this Commission upon application of the Burlington, effective October 18, 1927. An similar rate was also made effective for interstate shipments on the same date. However, this rate has been canceled on interstate </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION movements, the Interstate Commerce Commission refusing, in its I. &amp; S. Docket, to suspend the increase. One of the problems confronting the Commission in its determin - ation of the issues in this case, centers around the question of wheth - er Woodcliff is or is not a station. Applicant insists that Woodcliff is a station and that for that reason it erred originally, in requesting the switching rate for this service. In support of its position that this point is a station, within the transportation meaning of that term it alleges that Woodcliff, which is located 'approximately four miles south of Fremont and five miles north of Leshara, is physically in - dicated by a signboard or post; that it was established as a station at the time of completion of the railroad from. Ashland to Sioux City in 1906 and for transportation purposes has been so regarded con - tinuously from that date; that it has been listed as a station in applic - ant's tariffs, showing road haul rates to and from which freight was transported continuously since 1906, company tariffs being presented as exhibits to so indicate; that there is located at Woodcliff a lumber yard and elevator and that shipments have] been made to and from this station over a period of many years, and for the years specifical - ly named, as follows: 1925 1926 1927 Shipments Received Shipments Received Shipments Received 1 cir of lumber 4 cars lumber 11 cars, consisting 1 car coal of lumber, coal, rails, ties and posts. Shipments Forwarded Shipments Forwarded Shipments Forwarded 13 oars corn 1 car hay 75 cars corn 11 cars wheat 51 cars corn 21 cars wheat 15. cars wheat 1 car straw 2 cars hay . , 890 cars sand or gravel; that with the exception of some shipments of sand and gravel which moved late in 1927 under the switching rate in question, all of the above shipments were moved under the regular road haul rates named and published for service to and from Woodcliff; that any and all movements from this point are handled by j local freight trains, no •switching engine service being available; that Woodoliff is neither now, nor has it ever been, within the yard limits of Fremont, the Platte river forming a natural barrier between the two points; that while it is a non-agency station with no station! building, applioant has 114 non-agency stations in Nebraska, out of j a total of 417 stations, a great many of which have no station building. The confusion which follows the establishment of this switching rate from what applicant regards as a station is pointed out. The </seg>
            <seg id="p252">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT result is that respondent has available two different rates at the same time for the same class of service, i. e., the switching rate and the distance rate, or the switching rate and the joint through rate where shipment moves to connecting lines. No other industry at this point enjoys the switching rate which gravel company now has Applicant insists that such a situation is highly embarrassing and can only result in confusion and misunderstanding; furthermore, that the establishment of switching rates for service between stations is contrary to all principles of rate making. While all objections to granting the application have been with - drawn by them (see letter, infra), respondents originally contended that Woodcliff is not a station, alleging that it has neither depot facilities nor agent, billing of cars being done at Fremont or Leshara; that no mail, express or L. C. L. shipments are handled to or from this point ; that no loading facilities are available; that there are no retail stores at this point; that if it be regarded as a station the distance between stations thereby becomes much less than average ; and that the fact that movements from Woodcliff are handled by local freight trains is immaterial, the same thing being true at most Burlington points in Nebraska, switch engines being maintained at but very few places. Their conclusion is that it is nothing more than a spur designated by a signboard. It is further alleged by respondents that as evidence of the fact that Woodcliff is not a station, passenger service is not available either to or from same. Witness Mathews testified that he attempted to purchase at the Omaha ticket office, a ticket for Woodcliff, but was advised by the clerk that he could not sell him such a ticket as the Burlington had no passenger trains that stopped at that point. It seems apparent that the Burlington clerk was in error. Burlington tariffs definitely list Woodcliff as a passenger station and the ticket should have been sold to Woodcliff. Passenger trains passing through Woodcliff should stop to unload or accept passengers where there are passengers to unload or accept. Woodcliff is carried in Burlington Local Tariff No. 284-A, One-Way Fares also mileages and basis for constructing round-trip fares between stations on the Omaha Division, Lincoln, Nebraska, to Sioux City, Iowa, and Sioux City, Iowa, to O'Neill, Nebraska, issued January 25, 1921, effective March 1, 1921. Subse - quent supplements to this tariff have made no change in Woodcliff 's status as a passenger point. It is certainly a point to and from which applicant holds itself out to the public to furnish passenger service. The Commission has carefully considered the testimony and argu - ment of both parties respecting this particular question. Its eonclu - sion is that Woodcliff must be regarded as a station.

Industries at this point, including respondent, have the advantages which come from Woodcliff mileage and the further advantages which result from being able to bill cars direct to Woodcliff and have them spotted on the s,ding at that point. The establishment of a point of origin and destinahon in a carrier's table of distances, is a probative fact which must receive outstanding consideration in determining whether or not the place in question is a station. ■■In the case at hand, applicant holds itself out to the public as being. ready able and willing to handle business, both passenger and freight, with Woodcliff as an originating or I destination point. That the public have accepted this tender of service is reflected by the fact that over a long period of time, shipments of freight have been origin - ated and terminated at this point. , ■ Having found that. Woodeliff is a station, the Commission finds that earners request should be granted. Generally speaking, the granting of switching privileges and rates for station to station service is a violation of the fundamentals of rate making, resulting only in confusion. It leads to misunderstanding and! irritation on the part of other shippers and communities not enjoying similar privileges/and tends to break down all rate structures. Respondent at the time of hearing, complained of alleged unfair and discriminatory transportation conditions which would result, if the switching rate in question were canceled and certain switchin* arrange - ments available to other pits in the vicinity of Fremont, left undisturbed However, it is unnecessary to give these matters consideration herein,' since respondent, who operates the only industry affected, has. with - drawn all objections to the granting of the application. Under date of March 4, 1929, the Commission received the following letter, carried upon the letterhead of Sand^Gravel Company, and signed by the President and Secretary, of that company, as 'follows: .

This application was made by the Ponoa Valley Telephone Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION pany, to increase its telephone rates 25c per month and in ouuiuun. thereto, establish twenty-four hour service. This application came on for a public hearing, and public hearing was held at Verdel, on the 11th day of April, 1929, at which time alL parties concerned were given an opportunity to present arguments, either for or against the granting of the proposed increase. At this, time- there were no protestants, except S. M.| Armstrong, a subscriber - of the Ponca Valley Telephone Company. He was not opposing the raise, but wanted the assurance that the subscribers would receive - improved service, as well as twenty-four hour service, in case this, raise was granted. Out of the many subscribers of the Ponca Valley Telephone Company, none other protesting the raise, indicates in &amp; measure, a very good public relationship. The request for this increase is prompted by the desire of the patrons of this exchange, for improved service, and -the desire of the" company is to furnish the same by reconditioning its property and. furnishing twenty-four hour service. A petition was circulated among the patrons of the company by Mr. Campbell, the owner of the company, and he was assisted by - several of the patrons themselves. This petition requested the Com - mission to allow the company a 25c increase | on telephone rates, pro - vided the company would rebuild its lines and furnish the twenty-four - hour service to its patrons, and it was signed by over sixty per cent of the patrons, which was practically one hundred per cent of those canvassed in regard to the question. Mr. Campbell refrained from, circulating this petition further because of lack of time. His efforts, however, seemed very indicative of a very favorable attitude on the part of the. patrons. The properties of the telephone company are at present owned by C. B. Campbell, having been purchased by him from S. T. Sevatson oil July 1, 1926, for $1,892.56 cash, and shori; term notes in amount $1,100.00. The properties at that time were in a considerably depre - ciated condition. The territory of the company is quite extensive, rough and sparsely settled. All of these factors contribute to the - difficulty of rendering service of a first class nature at the lowest cost. These conditions, along with a run-down condition of the properties at. the time they were purchased by Mr. Campbell, have made the task of rendering good service exceedingly difficult, and it is the aim of the present owner to put additional capital into |the organization to re - build the property, and render a more efficient service. It was the testimony of both Mr. Campbell and the patrons, that the properties have been slowly slipping backward, and need (rebuilding. The annual report of the company to the Commission for the year 1928 was acknowledged as a fairly accurate criterion of the company's. </seg>
            <seg id="p256">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT financial status and its possibilities., This report reflects subscribers revenue in amount $2,980.37, net toll revenue of $223.07, miscellaneous revenue $61.45, or a total operating revenue of $3,264.89 for the year under the present rate schedule, which is as follows: Gross Net Business ........: $2.00 $1.75 Residence 1.50 1.25 Farm Line 1.50 1.25 The annual expense statement as acknowledged reflects a total o£ $2,862.62. No exception or criticism was made regarding any of the items included therein. The Commission is of the opinion that a L charges are reasonable and that the Company is being managed and operated on a very economical scale. A charge of $130.94 was mat e for taxes, interest and miscellaneous items, making a total deduction in amount $2,993.56, leaving a total of $271.33 available for dividends. The company expressed itself as satisfied at this / time with these earn - ings upon their investment under the present conditions. In contemplating its reconstruction and. added service, Mr. Camp - bell expects to invest additional capital in amount $3,000 and secure additional operating assistance. This additional operating assistance is intended to give 24-hour service and eliminate the present 10c night call and out-of-hour service charge. This additional expense is esti - mated at $360.00 per annum. Mr. Campbell testified that it would be necessary to borrow a large portion of the money to be used for re - construction at an interest rate of ten per cent. This money is to be secured in the form of short-term notes, with the idea of replacing these obligations with others bearing a lower interest rate. However, at this time it seems that these terms must be met. The improvement of the property will also entail additional expense in the form of taxes as was testified to by. Mr. Campbell, although there was no definite statement as to the approximate amount. At the present time the company furnishes service to 19 business subscribers, 33 residence subscribers, and 166 rural subscribers. An increase of 25c per. phone per month would result in increased revenue in amount $664.00 for the year.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This application is filed by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, requesting authority to revise its schedule of rates for service at its Fairbury exchange. No changes are proposed in rates for farm line service or the different forms of supplemental service. Hearing upon such application was held at the Chamber of Com - merce rooms, Fairbury, on May 3, 1929. General notice of such hear - ing was given, and the above appearances were made. No testimony was presented by respondents and but few questions ■were asked in cross-examination by them. The schedule of proposed rates is as follows: Business one-party ...: $4.25 Business two-party : 3.75 Residence one-party 2.50 Residence two-party 2.00 ' Rate comparisons can be of no great probative worth, though they are interesting. Applicant points out, in comparison with rates pro - posed for Fairbury, rates at certain other Nebraska exchanges some - what similar in size and in manner of service rendered, as follows : Classification Central Fair - of Service Holdrege Alliance City Chadron McCook bury Business one-party ;R50 . $4.50 $4.50 $4.50 $4.50 $4.25 Business two-party 3.75 3.75 3.75 , 3.75 3.75 3.75 Residence one-party .... 2.50 2.50 2.50 2.50 2.50 2.50 Residence two-party .... 2.00 . 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 Residence four-party .. 1.75 1.75 1.75 1.75 1.75 Residence ten-party .... 2.25 2,25 2.25 2.25 2.25 1.75 It is noted that the individual business rate proposed for Fairbury is 25 cents per month less than the rates at these named exchanges, the business two-party, residence individual and residence two-party </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE BAILWAY COMMISSION axe the same, while the rural rates at the Fairbury exchange, concern, ing which no change is proposed, are 50 centjs per month less than at the named exchanges. The rates above pointed to by applicant are rates authorized by decree of federal court, following appeal from order of this Commission. • ■ . . As of date of hearing, applicant was serving [ 243 business individual subscribers, 23 business two-party subscribers, 399 residence individual subscribers, 742 residence two-party subscribers, or a total of 1407 main station subscribers, exclusive of farm line sub - scribers, and subscribers to supplemental service such as business and residence extensions, P. B. X. stations and extra mileage subscribers. ■■■■■■ : ■' ■ ■ i In 1912, applicant purchased properties of the Bell company and the Fairbury Telephone. Company at Fairbury, consolidating the pro - perties of these two competing companies, into the one exchange. Sub - sequent to that date, there has been but the one exchange serving that territory. Applicant owns its own exchange and office building in Fairbury, the same having been erected in 1919. City service is common battery and farm line service is metallic. The properties, according to testimony of Commission engineer, who personally inspected and appraised them, have been well maintained and are now in good physical condition. ' - • ■ . . 1 ' In connection with the request to revise Fairbury rates, applicant alleges — • "The revenue which the applicant company receives from the operation of its Fairbury exchange, is not sufficient to pay operating expenses and taxes, and leave an adequate or fair re - turn on the fair and reasonable value of its telephone property used and useful in serving the said city of Fairbury and vicinity ». i ■ • also — "A continuation of the present rates for service at Fairbury, based upon the present existing investment of the company, has '•■■;. . constituted, and will continue to constitute, an unlawful confisca - tion of the applicant's property, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of the state of Nebraska and the Constitution of the United States of America." In its Exhibit 1, Schedule No. 3, applicant sets forth for certain years, in a classified way, revenues, expenses, net earnings, and per - '■'■■'■ i '■ ■ ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p260">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT centage of return on book cost of properties at Fairbury. Omitting detail, the totals are as follows : Year Year Year Year REVENUES 1925 1926 1927 1928 Total Telephone Revenue $55,814.73 $57,440.33 $58,304.56 $60,805.33 EXPENSES Total Expenses 44,596.21 49,769.99 49,762.55 50,005.65 Net Earnings $11,218.52 $7,670.34 $8,542.01. $10,799.68 Per cent Net Ear - nings on Book Cost of Property 4.94% 3.38% 3.76% 4.65% ■ The above revenues include monies received from any and all sources, that is, city and rural subscribers, toll allocated to the ex - change, and miscellaneous. Likewise, expenses include all items of expense properly chargeable to this exchange, exclusive of fair return. Applicant submits the following estimated annual earnings and expenses under the proposed rate schedule: Estimated Annual Earnings and Ex - penses tinder the REVENUES . Proposed Schedule Total Telephone Revenue $ 69,569.22 EXPENSES Total Expenses 53,513.56 Net Earnings ' $ 16,055.66 In the item of Exchange Service Revenue — $59,913 — considera - tion is given by applicant to what it estimates will be a small reduction in annual revenue due to some shifting of subscribers to a lower classification, as a result of the increased rate. Undoubtedly there will be some subscribers shift to a lower classification, perhaps not in the volume anticipated by applicant. . However, for the purposes of this case, the matter is relatively unimportant, since, if none of the loss estimated from this source is realized, and if the entire amount of the estimated loss were' to be added to net earnings, but slight difference would be made in the possible rate of return. ■ The item Toll Service Revenue — $8,976 — represents 25 per cent of the total outward toll charges of the exchange, based upon 1928 business, plus five per cent, this additional allowance being made in contemplation of further increase of the toll business over 1928. The 25 per cent toll allowance to the exchange is based upon provisions </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION of Nebraska]: statutes that the exchange originating the toll call shall receive 15 per cent of the toll charge, the jexchange terminating the same shall receive 10 per cent of the toll charge, the remainder being pro rated between companies owning toll lines. For the sake of ac - counting convenience, and economy, applicant has adopted the above allocation, the final result being approximately the same as though statutory provisions had been followed in precise detail. ■■■■'■ I As in the Beatrice- case, at the request of the Commission, appli - cant presented a study involving its Fairbury exchange, allocating, in so far as it was possible, revenues and expenses as between exchange and toll service. Such a study, of necessity involved many nice refinements. The formula used is perhaps as correct a one as can be worked out, and the results are probably as accurate as can be arrived at under any method of allocation. It is interesting to note that in terms of revenue, the results at both the Beatrice and Fairbury ex - changes are practically the same, whether toll revenue be credited to the exchange on a basis of 25 per cent of total outward business, or computed on the formula basis. It appears that no criticism can be offered to this figure. The revenue item, Miscellaneous Revenue — $1,710 — represents applicant's estimate of the amount of revenue to be realized from this source, based upon past experience. It results largely from directory advertising. . The red item, Licensee Revenue — $1,031 — is in reality an actual expense item. The item having been carefully considered by the Com - mission in previous orders, further discussion of same appears un - necessary here. Items listed under Expenses are, in the main, actual, and estimates for the future are based upon past experiences at this exchange. Estimate of total expenses is slightly in excess of the company's ex - perience at this exchange for the years just past. Wages of both plant men and operators have been recentlyj increased approximately 10 per cent. Applicant explains that this has been done in justice to experienced and competent help and that it might hold same in its organization. • The Commission has reviewed these expense items carefully and finds that, based upon past experience of the company, they are, in the main, reasonably correct. The Commission, in previous orders, has held that, a depreciation computed on a basis of six per cent of total plant in service, is in excess of company needs. In the Beatrice case and in other cases in which applicant has appeared before it, the Commission has authorized 2%' per cent on buildings and six per cent on all other property, exclusive of real estate. This becomes </seg>
            <seg id="p262">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT the equivalent of a composite depreciation on book cost of property of approximately 5% per cent. The application of this percentage would result in reducing applicant's total expenses slightly, thereby '■ increasing net earnings in an equivalent amount. . There still remains for Commission consideration, the question of fair values upon which applicant is entitled to earn. In reaching conclusions with respect to fair value, the Commission has before it as a guide, three figures, namely, alleged book cost, reproduction new less deterioration as found by engineers for the applicant, and repro - duction new less depreciation as found by engineers for the Commis - sion. Records of applicant disclose an investment or book cost, as of March 31, 1929, in amount of $233,284.43. This figure includes all exchange properties, both city and rural, but excludes all toll proper - ties other than so much of central office equipment and office build - ing, as should be allocated to toll, the use of which is compensated for in toll revenue credited to the exchange. This figure has its beginning at the time of purchase of properties of the Bell company and Fairbury Telephone Company by applicant in 1912. An appraisal figure was used at that time which represented applicant's best judg - ment as to the fair value of the properties as of that date, after proper consideration had been given to elimination of duplicate properties necessary. Applicant's books of account are kept in conformity with accounting rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Accord - ingly, from 1912 to date, additions to property undoubtedly reflect actual cost or investment figures. To the item of $233,284 should be added an item of $11,021 which represents net additions which have been made, or which are yet to be made to the Fairbury exchange. This figure is the result of gross additions to plant in amount $15,471, from which must be deducted plant removed in amount of $4,450. The main expenditures for additions to plant have to do with exchange pole lines, exchange aerial cable and central office operating equip - ment. Accordingly, the company records show a total book or invest - ment cost of $244,305. Engineer for applicant company has made a valuation of the pro - perty at this exchange which purposes showing reproduction value new less deterioration. This valuation discloses a reproduction value new of $281,210, a condition per cent of 85, and a reproduction value new less deterioration of $238,287. These figures are exclusive of working capital and going concern value. The Commission has pre - viously said that it cannot accept applicant's theory of deterioration which gives no consideration to accrued depreciation not visible, or inadequacy and obsolescence. Engineer McLain for applicant, admit - ted that deterioration which has been set forth in his exhibit, is some - thing less than what is commonly contemplated by the term depreci - ation, and stated that in determining deterioration, consideration had </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION been given only to those things which are 1 visible. To the item of $238,287, applicant contends should be added working capital in . amount of $11,270 computed on a basis of $5.00 per station on 2,254 stations, inclusive of $1,900 in stores and supplies; also, going concern value in amount of $28,121 computed on a basis of 10 per cent of physical value. If these items were to be ! added, applicant arrives at a figure of $277,678 upon which it contends it has a legal right to earn. Valuation made by the engineering department of this Commission . purposes showing reproduction new less depreciation. This valuation discloses an estimated cost of reproduction new in amount of $266,468, a per cent condition of properties of 78, and an estimated cost of reproduction new less depreciation, in amount $208,572. This figure gives no consideration to working capital or going concern value. The Commission is fully aware of the holdings! of the courts respecting the consideration which must be given these' two items. It seems un - necessary to discuss them in detail here for reasons which will sub - sequently be set forth. Depreciation, as found by Commission engine - er, Taylor, working under supervision of the Commission's chief en - gineer, Forbes, gives consideration to the age of the properties and probable future life, contemplates accrued depreciation not visible, and takes into account inadequacy and obsolescence. Conclusions were based on personal inspection of the properties. There is no disagreement by the engineer for the Commission and engineer for applicant, as to quantities of property. The differences in their conclusions are explained by different cost units applied to - quantities found, and the difference in the theory of the Commission's engineering department and applicant's engineering department, in de - termining deterioration as compared with depreciation. ' ' I - The Commission is familiar with the holdings of the courts which require that consideration must be given to reproduction new less depreciation, in. reaching conclusions as to fair value. McArdle v. Indianapolis Water Company, 272 U. S. 300; City of Knoxville v. Knox - ville Water Co., 212 TJ. S. 1; St. Louis &amp; O'Fallon R. R. Co. v. United States, 73 L. Ed. U. S. Rep. (Ad. Sheets) J457. However, it is not in agreement with contention of Engineer Wheeler of applicant com - pany, that reproduction new less deterioration is the sole and only factor to be given consideration. For the purposes of this case, it seems unnecessary for the Com - mission to make definite findings as to fair j value of properties upon which applicant might be entitled to earn. Net earnings available for dividends, produce a fair return of approximately 6%- per cent on investment or book cost. If consideration were given by the Commis - sion to reproduction new values, the percentage of return would be reduced below that percentage. • '. ■ . </seg>
            <seg id="p264">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT inspecting the rate of return, the courts of our land have spoken rather definitely. In McArdle v. Indianapolis Water Company, 272 U. S. 400, the Supreme Court of the United States said: "The evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the rate of 7 per cent found by the Commission. Arid recent decisions support a higher rate of return." Again in Pacific Gas v. San Francisco, 265 U. S. 403, this court said: "We think the evidence supports the finding that a net re - turn of 7 per centum was necessary in order to avoid confisca- And again in Bluefield Waterworks &amp; Improvement Co. y. Public Ser - vice Commission of West Virginia, 262 U. S. 679, this same court said: "Under the facts and circumstances indicated by the record, we think that a rate of return of 6 per cent ... is sub - stantially too low to constitute just compensation." Certainly, it cannot be said that a return of approximately 6y 2 per cent on book cost is a higher rate of return than applicant is legally entitled to earn. The facts and figures involved in this application have been most carefully reviewed. The matters involved have been given the most careful attention of the Commission's engineering department and its accounting department, in review of revenue and expense items and valuation of property items. The conclusion must be reached that rates proposed by applicant are fair, reasonable and necessary.

Such a study, of course, involved many major refinements in separating toll and ex - change property and in allocating expense as between the two classes of service. This formula followed is one used by the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company and is probably as accurately worked out as is possible. The interesting fact is that the result in terms of revenue at each of these exchanges, is practically the same, whether toll revenue be credited to the exchange on a basis of 25 per cent of the outward business or computed on the formula basis. The figure used by ap - plicant seems to be proper. In reaching a conclusion as to the amount of miscellaneous revenue, namely, $2,560.72, applicant takes the amount realized from this item in 1928. In the main, the source of revenue in this item is directly advertising. The item has remained practically constant during the last four years and the company's estimate is probably close. The item Licensee Revenue is in reality an expense item. It re - presents payment in amount of l ] /&gt; per cent of gross revenue to the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for services and benefits received by applicant under contractual relationship with the A. T. &amp; T. Under this contract, applicant receives from A. T. &amp; T. Company, engineering services, accounting services of any kind, annual audits and privilege of purchasing materials and supplies from the Western Electric Company, together with other advantages of importance in the conduct of a telephone business. General Manager Agee stated that the provisions of this contract made possible many economies and savings in operation otherwise impossible. It is an actual item of expense. Since the Commission has increased applicant's estimated exchange service revenue $1,000, the item Licensee Revenue must be increased to $1,488.07. The result of these changes leaves total telephone revenue in amount $99,737.94. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY .COMMISSION Items listed under Expenses are m the main actual, and estimates are based upon past experiences of applicant at this exchange. The outstanding items are current Repairs, Depreciation and Traffic. Because of their importance, the Commission will discuss these. • The amount $12,371, estimated for current repairs per annum, includes all cost of constantly maintaining the exchange m proper service condition, exclusive of replacements! to property. This figure is an average of the company's actual experience for the four-year period 1925 to 1928, inclusive. The expense of maintenance varies from year to year. A four-year period was taken, m that it is the polioy of applicant to go over its lines carefully and rehabilitate them at least once every three or four years. The company should not be handi - capped or discouraged m its policy of constantly maintaining its properties m such condition as to be able to render prompt, efficient service. This estimate is undoubtedly approximately correct. Any variation from the estimate, m amount either more or less, would undoubtedly be so small as to m nowise affect the rate base An annual expense item $18,220, is set up for depreciation. This is computed on a basis of six per cent of total plant m service. Appli - cant computes depreciation on a figure of $303,674, consisting of total plant m service on December 31, 1928, m amount $291,608 as reflected : by the company's books, plus an item of $6,365.51 covering cost of transmitters and receivers formerly leased from the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, but now owned by applicant, plus $5,700 which is the estimated cost of audible ringing and flashing recall equipment which is to be installed. Witness Lemon, auditor for the company, testified that since 1919 applicant has followed generally the policy of setting up depreciation on a basis of six per cent of the cost of all properties used and useful m the business ; ! that prior to that time, less than six per cent had been set up only because company's revenues were inadequate to permit of six per cent being set up;' and that it represented the management's best judgment as to the proper rate to be used for depreciation. The "company's books disclosed the fact that during the period of its ownership of this I exchange, from 1913 to December 31, 1928, there has been set aside Innder the heading of de - preciation reserve $207,095, and that during same period charges have been made against this reserve m amount of $150,628 leaving a balance to the credit of the reserve of $56,467. As of December 31, 1928, the ratio of reserve for accrued depreciation to total fixed capital, as disclosed by exhibit presented by applicant upon request of the Commission, was 24.5 per cent. Witness Agee, general manager for applicant, expressed the opinion that this reserve should be accum - ulated still further until it reaches at least 35 to 40 per cent of the total book cost. The Commission need enter into no general discussion here as to the propriety of a depreciation reserve fund against which charges for </seg>
            <seg id="p272">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT replacements, when required, shall be made that the utility may be guaranteed against loss of property used in the public service, and that the public may be guaranteed adequate and efficient service constantly. The courts of our land and regulatory bodies have uniformly held that the creation of such a reserve fund is a proper charge against operat - ing expenses. This Commission has adhered to a rule generally ac - cepted by both courts and other Commissions, that revenue shall be called upon in accounting for displaced property to meet the loss re - presented by the difference between book cost and salvage. Depreciation is a loss of value, whether tangible or intangible in form, resulting from wear, and tear in operation, the action of the elements, inadequacy and obsolescence. The Commission is confronted with a question of whether six per cent applied to the book cost of all properties of this exchange, inclusive o£ real estate, is necessary to accomplish the purposes of a depreciation reserve. In Platte Valley Telephone Corporation, Application No. 6758— securities — 20th Annual Report, Nebraska State Railway Commission, . page 345, this Commission directed that "Applicant shall charge income and: credit its depreciation reserve with an amount which is not less than 5 per cent computed on the investment cost' of the physical properties as shown by the books to pay the cost of plant retired from service." .',' This was fixed as a miniim-im amount which applicant should set up, there being no restriction as to maximum. In a recent application of applicant herein requesting authority to increase rates at Syracuse, it computed the amount necessary for depreciation on a basis of 2% per cent of the cost of buildings and 6.28 per cent on the balance of plant cost, exclusive of lands. The same method was followed in its application to increase rates at Wymore. In this case the Commission allowed 2% per cent on build - ings and 5y 2 per cent on all other depreciable property, although it was stated that in allowing this reduced amount, it had- in mind the fact that the Wymore exchange had no farm lines. Witness Wheeler testified to the fact that the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company had made certain studies respecting depreciation covering its operations in Ne - braska, in compliance with a request of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission. The result of these studies, he stated, showed a percentage used by the Northwestern Bell of 5.34 per cent of book value. For the purposes of this case, the Commission will allow 2 J /2 P er cent on buildings, which is a commonly accepted rate of depreciation on buildings of this sort where obsolescence is an important factor, as in this case, and six per cent on all other property, exclusive of real estate, thereby making an annual allowance for depreciation of $17,222. This is the equivalent of a . composite depreciation on book cost of property of approximately 5Y 2 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">JNISBRASKA STATE RAILWAYj COMMISSION The other outstanding item of expense is that listed as traffic me item is largely made tip of wages paid operators. In computing the estimate, applicant took its actual experience for 1928 and in - creased it by $900, the increase reflecting additional wages which will be paid operators under the company's revised wage scale. The Com - mission is not disposed to find fault with wages paid operators. It is familiar with the scale paid by applicant and would not urge economies through the medium of reduced wages to the girls who furnish this necessary and important service, oft-times under rather trying circum - stances. The other expense items not herein specifically discussed are m the main actual, the company's estimate for the future being based upon past experience. Any revision which the Commission might make, could m nowise affect the rate base. Usine the figure which the Commission finds proper for depreciation, total expenses amount to $79, 561.00. Deducting this from total telephone Revenue above found m amount $99, 737.94, net earnings are found m amount $20,176.94. - There still remains the question of fair value of the properties upon which applicant is entitled to earn. The Commission has before it as a guide m reaching conclusions, three" figures, viz:, the alleged book cost, reproduction new less deterioration as found by engineers for applicant, and reproduction new less depreciation as found by engi - neers for the Commission; These will be discussed. Applicant's records show ah investment or book cost m amount of $303,673, inclusive of all exchange properties, both city and rural, but exclusive of all toll properties other than so much of central office equipment and office building as should be allocated to toll, the use of which is compensated for m toll revenue | credited to the exchange. This figure is made up of a so-called book cost of properties of $291,608.60 as of December 31, 1928, plus cost of transmitters and re - ceivers formerly leased from A. T. &amp; T. Company, m amount $6,365.51, plus cost of audible ringing and flashing recall equipment m amount $5,700. The item of $291,608 is not, however, entirely book cost. It has its beginning m an item of $212,000 plus, at which figure the consolidated Beatrice properties of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, formerly the New Home Company and the Nebraska Tele- " phone Company, were placed on books of applicant m 1912. The figure was the result of an inventory and appraisal of the Beatrice exchange and represent reproduction new as of that date. Applicant's books of account are kept m conformity with accounting rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Accordingly, from 1912 to date, company records undoubtedly reflect actual cost ox investment figures. Respecting- the valuations made by the I engineering department of the Commission and by company engineers, it should be said that they include all exchange properties, both city and rural. They include no </seg>
            <seg id="p274">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT toil properties other than so much of central office equipment and office building, as should be allocated to toll, the use of which is com - pensated for in toll revenue credited to the exchange. In the inventory, any pole carrying toll wires, even though carrying exchange wires, is. considered a toll pole and is not listed in the inventory of exchange properties. There is no disagreement between Commission engineers and applicant's engineers as to quantity of units of property. The. valuations are both as of August, 1928. The valuation made by engineer for applicant, purposes showing reproduction value new less deterioration. It discloses a reproduction value new exclusive of working capital and going concern value, of $373,471.' The properties are found to be in 84 per cent condition-based upon applicant engineer's theory of deterioration. This gives a re - production value new less deterioration of $314,834. Both Engineer McLain who made the field studies, and Chief Engineer Wheeler, under whose supervision .the appraisal was made for applicant, agree that deterioration which they set forth, is something less than what is - commonly contemplated by the term depreciation. In applicant's valuation, accordingly, no consideration has been given to. accrued depreciation not visible ; no consideration has been given to age of the properties ; no consideration has been given to inadequacy and ob - solescence. In cross-examination, witness McLain, concerning this, subject matter, said : "I didn't consider anything that wasn't visible". The valuation made by the engineering department of this Com - mission purposes showing reproduction new less depreciation. It dis - closes a reproduction value new, exclusive o£ working capital and going concern value, of $360,349. The properties are found to be in 74.5 per cent condition, depreciated. This gives a reproduction. value new less depreciation of $268,653. Depreciation found by Commission Engineer Taylor, working under supervision of the Commission's Chief Engineer Forbes, gives consideration to the age of the properties and probable future life, contemplates accrued depreciation not visible and takes into account inadequacy and obsolescence. Conclusions were, of course, largely based on personal inspection of the properties. It is a well recognized principle of regulation that in determining: fair value, consideration must be given to present costs. The Supreme Court of the United States has said many times that reproduction value new, depreciated, must be given important consideration by regulatory bodies in determining fair value, and that failure to do so involves confiscation. In a rather recent decision, this court said: "Undoubtedly the reasonable cost of a system of water works, well planned and efficient for the public service, is good evidence of its value at the time of construction, and such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount to be at - tributed to the physical elements of the property, so long as there </seg>
            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION is no change m the level of applicable prices. And . . ,it is true that if the tendency or trend o£ prices is not definitely upward or downward and it does not appear probable that there will be a substantial change of prices, then the present value of lands pins the present cost of constructing the plant, less depre - ciation, if any, is a fair measure of the value of the physical elements .of the property." -'. I McArdle v. Indianapolis Water Company, 272 U. S. 400. In a very recent case known as the O'Fallon case, St. Louis &amp; O'Fallon R. R. Co. v. United States, 73 L. Ed. U. S. Rep. (Ad. Sheets) 457, involving a valuation of certain railroad properties by the Inter - state Commerce Commission, the Interstate Commission's fair value figure was set aside by the United State's Supreme Court, because consideration had not been given to reproduction value new. . In City of Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Company, 212 U. S. 1, this court again said: "The cost of reproduction is one way of ascertaining the present value of a plant . . . but that test would lead to obviously incorrect results if the cost of reproduction is not diminished by the depreciation which has come from age and use." While this Commission has not m the past, and does not now, agree with the theory of determining fair value which gives outstanding consideration to reproduction new, it is obliged, m reaching conclusions, to follow the principles of law laid down by the courts of our land. In the instant oase, applicant's properties {have been well maintained and m recent years, many units of new property have been placed, such replacements having been made during the period of high prices. Accordingly, m so far as these replacements are concerned, original cost and reproduction new become quite similar. Applicant claims that to such figure as is finally found repre - senting reproduction new, depreciated, should be added an amount for working capital and going concern value. Working capital is recognized by courts and commissions as a proper capital item, under certain circumstances. Ordinarily, with a common carrier, it involves two factors: First, the necessary investment m stock of materials and supplies, and second, the cash necessary to pay actual operating expenses incurred m the furnishing of common carrier service prior to the time when the 'revenues received from the furnishing of that service are available. ! Applicant stated that the use of the $5.00 per station figure was more or less .arbitrary, but that the total represented the T™™"" 1 " 1 amount estimated as necessary based upon past experience. </seg>
            <seg id="p276">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT It seems proper that consideration should be given to the fact that charges for service are paid for, in the main, on or before the 10th of the month by city subscribers, and during the first month of the current quarter by rural subscribers. In other words, in each instance, two-thirds of the service rendered is paid for in advance. This has the effect of reducing the amount of working capital necessarily to be capitalized. This Commission has followed no fixed rule in de - termining working capital. A review of court and Commission de - cisions indicates that working capital varies from 10 to 18 per cent of total operating expenses, depending upon the circumstances surround - ing the individual case. Applicant claims going concern value in amount 10 per cent of physical property value. Again, this is ah item of value which this Commission has recognized, but in the computation of which it has followed no fixed rule. In fact, it iB.an item concerning which there could well be no fixed rule, the peculiar circumstances in each case being the controlling factor and being highly variable. In McArdle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra, the court said : "The decisions of this court declare: 'That there is an element of value in an essembled and established plant doing business and earning money over one not thus advanced, is self evident. This element of value is a property right and should be considered in determining "the value of the property, upon which the owner has a right to make a fair return when. the same, is privately owned although dedicated to public use.' " In that case the court also said that ten per cent of the value of the physical elements would be low in computing going value. An average percentage allowed generally by courts and Commissions would probably be in the neighborhood of ten per cent of the cost of repro - duction new. For the purposes of this case it seems unnecessary to find a definite figure representing the Commission's conclusions as to fair value. If a return be computed upon applicant's book cost, it is found that the net revenue available for dividends after additions made by the Com - mission to revenue, and deductions made by the Commission from operating expenses, would approximate 6y 2 per cent. If a figure representing reproduction new, depreciated, but inclusive of certain items for going concern value and working capital were to be found representing fair value, the rate of return available would be consider - ably less than 6y 2 per cent. It cannot be said that this is a higher rate of return than applicant is legally entitled to earn. The Commission knows of no holdings of the courts which would permit of a reduction in rates if it involved a consequent reduction of fair return to some - thing less than 6% per cent of. book cost. The facts and figures in - volved in this application have been most carefully reviewed and con- </seg>
            <seg id="p277">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION sidered.. In the Commission's calculations it has made certain addi - tions to revenue which are more or less arbitrary and which involved a substitution of the Commission's judgment for the judgment of the management. Again, it has .reduced applicant's estimate of expenses. However, after this revision of figures, the conclusion must be reached that the rates proposed by applicant are fair and reasonable and necessary.

" '..'.- OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This application is filed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corpor - ation in Nebraska requesting authority to amend Paragraph (a) of Item 615-A of Supplement No. 6 to Missouri Pacific Railroad Tariff No. 4778-H, I. C. C. No. A-7188, by reinstating the former provisions of Item 615. The result of the proposed amendments to tariffs is to cancel the switching charge of $6.30 per car between connections with the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company, hereinafter referred to as Rock Island, and industries located on tracks of applicant at Louisville, and further, to eliminate all switching service at this point between ap - plicant and Rock Island. The same subject matter has been before the Interstate Commission in its I. &amp; S. Docket 3142. Joint hearings before the Nebraska Com - mission and the Interstate Commission were held in Omaha on Septem - ber 18, 1928, and January 14, 1929, the appearances being as above set forth. Order of the Interstate Commission was entered in its ,1. &amp; S. Docket 3142 under date of July 25, 1929, such order canceling schedules filed with it, which said schedules had for their purpose the cancella - tion of the switching charge in question. This Commission is in agree - ment with the Interstate Commission decision in this matter. ■ Applicant, in presenting its request, lays particular stress on the alleged fact that there is no direct physical rail connection between its tracks and tracks of Rock Island, whereby interchange of traffic may be lawfully made; consequently, it desires the cancellation of the switching charge covering the switching movement which it alleges is not lawfully possible. However, in fact there is a direct physical connection between tracks of applicant and those of Rock Island. Physical exchange of carload traffic between these two carriers at the disputed point has </seg>
            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAYj COMMISSION been made for a number of years. It is true that there is a consider - able conflict in the testimony respecting actual ownership of a certain stretch of track approximately 147 feet in length, apparently not owned either by applicant or Rook Island. It is [agreed that tracks of ap - plicant connect with the eastern end of this stretch and that tracks of Rock Island connect with the western end jof this stretch. Applicant contends that protestant,. National Stone Company, owns such track; also, that respondent, Rock Island, has no legal right to use same for • purposes of interchange. The Rock Island contends that it certainly has a legal right of use, this being concurred in by National Stone Company, which alleges that complete ownership of fee is vested in Rock Island. This Commission agrees with the conclusions of the Interstate Commerce Commission respecting 1 this question, namely, that "the Rock Island is entitled to the presumption that it has a legal right to the use it now is making, unmolested by the alleged owner, of the tracks upon which it operates." Vigorous protests were entered against the granting of the proposed request by Ash Grove Lime &amp; Portland Cement Company, National Stone .Company and Rock Island. The stone company is owned by the cement company and operates two quarries within the switching limits of Louisville. The Cement com - pany has recently completed a large cement manufacturing plant served directly by Missouri Pacific and C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad Company. Both stone company and cement company distribute their products outbound from Louisville over the lines of all carriers serving locally. They are vitally interested in the application, in that the continued interchange of traffic with the Rock Island is of great importance from a transportation standpoint, both in the matter of rates and - convenience of shipment. If the application were to be granted and the switching service now being furnished, eliminated, interchange of traffic originating on applicant's tracks or on tracks of its connections, destined to or coming from Rock Island points, would have to be made at point of physical track connection other than Louisville. The result would, of course, involve rates and promptness of movement. Again, this Commission is in entire agreement with the Interstate Commission decision wherein it is pointed out that "the consequence of such action, if allowed to become effective, concededly would require circuitous and wasteful transportation and would substantially increase the transportation costs to shippers who would be compelled to pay higher rates applic - able via other junctions over longer distances. This fact being con - ceded by all parties, illustrations are deemed unnecessary." No question was raised by applicant as to the reasonableness or sufficiency of the $6.30 switching rate now published and collected. Accordingly, this question is in nowise before the Commission for con - sideration. ] The conclusion is ■ reached that request of applicant should bo denied. </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This application for authority to establish a toll charge for tele - phone messages transmitted over a certain grounded trunk line circuit between Petersburg and Elgin, was first filed by the Petersburg Telephone Company. Upon investigation the Commission learned that </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY i COMMISSION the trunk line above referred to was owned] Jointly by Raeville Mutual Telephone Company and German Mutual Telephone Company. Ap - plicant was advised by the Commission to the effect that it could not recognize an application to establish rates' upon property not owned by applicants Later, application was filed in which all telephone companies or organizations affected by the application were made joint applicants, viz; German Mutual Telephone Company, Antelope County Mutual Telephone Company, Petersburg Telephone Company and Raeville Mutual Telephone Company. I ' Hearing was held upon this application at Petersburg, April 10, 1929, after due notice had been given to jail interested subscribers. Prior to the hearing a special meeting was called by both the Rae - ville Mutual Telephone Company and the German Mutual Telephone Company for the purpose of- discussing the change proposed herein. Officials representing the two companies testified that all members unanimously agreed to the. policy of assessing a toll charge for messages over the trunk line. . The trunk line which it is proposed to use for toll purposes is approximately 18 miles in length and provides a grounded circuit connecting Petersburg and Elgin. The German Mutual Telephone Company owns the line from the corporate limits of Elgin to the county line south, and the Raeville Mutual Telephone Company owns the line from that point south to' the corporate limits of Petersburg. Heretofore this trunk line has been used extensively by both Petersburg and Elgin telephone subscribers and without compensation to the owners of the line except such consideration as has been realized through a reduction in switching rate. No Itestimony was offered at the hearing to indicate how much this compensation might be, except that the net rate for the Raeville Mutual Telephone Company was 25c per month per subscriber, paid to the Antelope County Mutual Tele - phone Company at Elgin, and $1.00 per year per subscriber paid by the Raeville Telephone Company to the Petersburg Telephone Company. The testimony of representatives of applicant companies herein clearly indicates that the maintenance of the trunk line has been neg - lected on account of insufficient funds. The source of funds used for the maintenance of the trunk line has been the assessing of mem - bers of the companies who own the line.' This method has proved to be burdensome to the members of the companies and has made proper maintenance at times most difficult. In 'fact, at the time of the hear - ing the line bad been out of use since the first of the year, primarily for the reason that the Raeville Mutual Telephone Company, was not able to secure sufficient funds from its members to compensate a lineman for repairing the line. It was pointed out by applicants that the proposed toll rate between Elgin and Petersburg over this trunk line might be the means of securing sufficient funds to properly main- </seg>
            <seg id="p282">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT J tain it. It was further pointed out at the hearing that if a toll charge, were made for the use of the line thai the revenue for its maintenance would accrue from the users of the property. The subscribers at Elgin and Petersburg at present have available a toll connection by way of Neligh and Albion. However, there is no direct toll circuit connecting Elgin and Petersburg. Testimony in - dicated that considerable delay was experienced in getting calls over the rather circuitous route of the present toll line. The applicants propose a toll charge of 15c person to person, and 10c station to station, in accordance with the present authorized toll rate for the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company which operates in' that territory. The Commission has no means of ascertaining the amount of revenue which might be derived from the proposed rate; it may or may not be sufficient to maintain the trunk line and enable its owners to render efficient service. It is the Commission's opinion, however, that the application should be granted, since the proposed toll rate will provide a means of securing revenue from those benefiting from the service and relieves the subscribers of the small companies operating the trunk line circuit from a financial burden which should be distributed to those who use the service.' ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the applicants herein, the Petersburg Telephone Com - pany, German Mutual Telephone Company, Raeville Mutual Telephone Company, and Antelope County Mutual Telephone Company be and the same are hereby authorized to charge and collect for telephone mes - sages transmitted over trunk line between Elgin and Petersburg, and owned by the Raeville Mutual Telephone Company and the German Mutual Telephone Company, a toll charge of 15c per message, person to person rate, and 10c per message station to station rate.

It has an auth - orized capital stock of $14,000 divided into 140 shares of the par value of $100 each. It now has 120 shares of stock outstanding. This ap - plication is for a permit to issue 20 shares of additional stock to represent net earnings invested in property. Petitioner owns and operates a telephone plant at Callaway. It was incorporated June 18, 1909, with an authorized capital of $12,000 par value. On February 13, 1929, the articles of incorporation were amended to provide for the issuance of 'the stock prayed for in this application. In the year 1920, the property of the company was appraised by the Commission on the cost basis and the books of the company were set up to correspond with the findings at that time. Since 1920, the accounts of the company have been kept under rules prescribed by the Commission. A hearing on the matter was held in the offices of the Commission December 14, 1928, and the testimony shows that the surplus and profit and loss accounts as of July 31, 1928, have a credit balance in the amount of $3,751.65. This represents earnings available for dividends and invested in the property as shown by the reports filed with the Commission §inoe 1920. Only nine or ten per cent has been paid in dividends on the capital stock outstanding in the last eight years. This required approximately $360, whereas the net earnings after all charges have been from $600 to $1,000 per year. Additions to plant have been paid for in -these years and liabilities reduced, which originated on account of an in - crease in fixed property. The new surplus will be approximately $1,700 giving effect to the proposed issue of stock. Applicant will issue the new stock pro rata over the stock out - standing as evidence of earnings reinvested. Notice to the public has not been given of the proposed increase- in capital as provided by the constitution and the order will provide that the authority to issue the new stock shall not be effective until such notice has been given. The Commission finds that the net earnings of the company have been reinvested in the property in lieu of dividends not paid and that the new issue of stock, as prayed for, is reasonably required' for the purposes of the corporation.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This applicant, the Lynch Telephone Company of Lynch, asks the Commission's approval of an increase in its exchange rates. The following table discloses the present number of subscribers' stations,.' the present and proposed rate for different classes of service and the increase in revenues which might be derived from the proposed rates: </seg>

The above rates contemplate unrestricted 24-hour service -which is not now enjoyed by the subscribers. Examination of the testimony taken at the hearing indicates that for a number of years the subscribers of applicant company have been deprived of reasonable telephone service. . The subscribers vigor - ously protested any increase in rates at this time contending that they had never recieved telephone service commensurate with the rates paid. The present management, which has had charge of the service only since January, 1928, cannot be held accountable for the acts of its predecessors. The Commission recognizes, however, that the subscribers no doubt have just cause for complaint. Testimony which was not disputed, disclosed that many farm lines were at the time of the hearing in very poor service condition and, in fact, some of them lying on the ground and on fences. The Commission is of the opinion that reasonable service to the subscribers should precede a rate adjustment. It may be that the pre - sent rates of applicant are inadequate to render efficient service and pay a reasonable return to applicant. The Commission will analyze applicants finances and determine upon the rates which will yield a reasonable return and permit of furnishing efficient telephone service. Any finding, however, made in this respect will be made with the provi - sion that the rates found reasonable shall not be placed in effect until •the telephone plant has been rehabilitated and the subscribers are re - ceiving telephone service which measures up to the standard for tele - phone exchanges similarly situated. A final determination of when the rates shall be made effective will follow a personal inspection of the property by the Commission's engineering department. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE BAILWAyIcOMMISSION In support o£ its application for increased revenue applicant sub - mits the following revenue and expense statement 'which is based upon the first seven month's experience for. 1928 {and extended to represent twelve months: Subscribers Service Revenue $3,855.60 Toll Revenue . 394.20 Total Revenue $4,249.80 Maintenance and Repairs $2,466.24 Depreciation of P. &amp; E. 172.44 $2,638.68 Operators wages $1,340.52 $1,340.52 Officers Salaries 300.00 Clerks Salaries 317.16 Rents . 57.60 Rents (exchange quarters) 220.00 Stationery and Printing 109.80 Office Supplies &amp; Expenses 169.20 Other General Expenses 5.04 — — — — — — $1,178.80 Total Operating Expenses $5,158.00 Taxes Accrued 180.00 Total Expenses $5,338.00 . Deficit (1,088.20) The item of maintenance and repairs m -the above statement m amount $2,466.24 represents m part extraordinary repairs and deferred maintenance which will not be experienced! m each succeeding year. - During the past year an extensive rebuilding program was undertaken and consequently abnormal maintenance and repairs expenses were -experienced. Applicant is now paying for lineman's labor $1,500 per annum and m addition it furnishes and maintains an automobile for the use of the lineman. Applicant company maintains at the present time' approximately 214 subscribers' stations. The exchange plant does not extend over a very wide territory but might be considered as somewhat more difficult to maintain on account of its location than other exchange plants covering a territory of equal size. After giving consideration to the circumstances under which applicant oper - ates, the Commission is of the opinion that $2,000 per annum should re - present the normal requirements of applicant for maintenance, repairs - and depreciation purposes. The above statement will be amended m this respect. Expenses for operators' wages m the statement appear, slightly higher than applicant's present outlay. However, since the proposed rates contemplate unrestricted 24-hour service the amount is found reasonable. </seg>
            <seg id="p288">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT The Commission also finds that rents included in the above state - ment in amount $57.60 should be reduced to $4.00 per annum which is the amount paid by applicant for pin. rental. This correction was made by applicant at the hearing. The above corrections would require a deduction in amount $692.28 from the operating expenses set up by applicant, and consequently reduces the alleged deficit of $1,088.20 to $395.92. With the exceptions above noted we find applicant's operating expense statement to be reasonable. As disclosed by the table appearing on the second page of these findings, the proposed increase in rates would yield approximately $1,416.60 additional per annum. When the contemplated increase in revenue is applied to the deficit found above in amount $395.92. there remains for dividends $1,020.68. Applicant's book accounts show a total plant account of $18, - 624.45. The origin of the book figure was the result of an apprais - ment of the physical property of applicant prepared by the Com - mission's engineering department and based upon the quantity of property furnished to the Commission by applicant in 1920. This valuation showed an original construction cost of $18,400 and depreci - ated cost of $11,374. The cost units were applied by the Commission. No inspections of properties were made at the time and the property was depreciated in the inventory on such information as the Commis - sion had available without a personal inspection. The Commission has no definite knowledge o£ the. physical condition of the exchange plant at this time. However, there is ample proof of record that the property is depreciated to such an extent that the entire plant must be rebuilt. The present owners paid $6,250 for the plant in January, 1928. The owner's cash investment is carried on the books as $3,600 of capital stock and $3,650 as notes payable. From information available the Commission finds it impossible to definitely state the fair value of applicant's property. Under these circumstances, the Commission will approve of rates which will, upon the basis of the foregoing computations, yield an 8% return upon the $10,000. The figure of $10,000 is taken by the Commission as representing the closest approximation of fair value which can be reached from the record made in the case, after the improvements necessary and contemplated herein have been made. If applicant is able to subsequently prove to the Commission that the rate base is too low, the Commission will upon proper showing amend its findings in this respect. . \ </seg>
            <seg id="p289">■ NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In view of the above reasoning, it follows that applicants pro - posed rate structure must be amended. The Commission will approve . a rate structure which will provide approximately $800 per annum additional revenue. The farm line rate proposed by' applicant is much higher than prevailing rates for grounded magneto farm service and is also some - what high as compared to other proposed rates when a balanced rate structure is considered. If the farm line rate is reduced to $1.50 net and $1.75 gross, and other rates approved as proposed by applicant, the revised rates would yield approximately $731 additional revenue per annum, upon the basis of the net rate and number of subscribers at present. This return is slightly below 8% upon $10,000. The de - ficiency will no doubt be easily off-set by the collections of some gross rentals and an increasing number of subscribers. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the! Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lynch Telephone Company be and the same is hereby authorized- to charge and collect the following schedule of rates: Per Month Gross Net Business individual wall j $3.00 $2.75 Residence individual wall - ! 2.00 1.75 Rural party wall i 1.75 1.50 Extension sets .50 • Service stations .60 Cradle type sets, extra .50 Desk sets, extra .25 NOTE: The above rates shall be collectible as follows: City subscribers rental shall be payable monthly in advance, the net rate to apply if payment is made on or before the 10th of the cur - rent month billed.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 7474 In the matter of the application of the Lincoln Traction Company for authority to abandon street railway lines and service and substi - tute bus service on its Normal line.' Appearances: For applicant — George A. Lee, attorney. For the city — , . Charles R. Wilke, attorney. For the protestants — Bernard Gradwobl, Sanden &amp; Gradwohl, attorneys. . . OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: . .- : . The hearing on this application was held in the hearing room of the Commission in the state capitol building at 10 :00 a. m. on the eighth day of November, 1928. The Traction Company was represented by its attorney, George A. Lee, the city of Lincoln by Charles R. Wilke, deputy city attorney, and the protestants were represented by Bernard Gradwohl. A large number of interested parties were present and testified as to the necessity of a continuation of service over the pre - sent route between the point where the street car company intersects South Street to the present terminal at Normal. There was no serious objection to the routing of the busses as proposed by the Traction Company between down town Lincoln and this point on South Street, where- the street car now intersects South Street. • The principal objection was raised by residents living east of South Street on what is called the loop, where the street car company </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION now maintains a track fpr some three blocks and makes the turn around at the terminal. The street from South Street to the terminal is something over three blocks long and a number of residences are located at the terminus of the track.. These people have been receiving street car service for years, in fact this line was built through Normal to College View and -was operated as the main line to College View for a number of years. Soon after the Lincoln. Traction Company acquired the Citizens Street Railway line, service between the terminal of the present line at Normal to College View was abandoned, and service has been over what is called the highline on Sheridan Boulevard. There was no written agreement at -that time that service j would be continued from South Street to the new terminal, but it was a tangible understanding with these people, that they should have that service, owing to the fact they had established their homes there,' by reason of the trans - portation facilities ana for all these years since the abandonment of the line to College View these people have had this street car service. The street from South Street to the terminal is not paved or gravelled.- If this street car track was abandoned and the street was not graded and gravelled, or paved, these people would be without street car or bus service; nearer than South Street. The application of the Traction Company to substitute busses,' included the running of the busses onto the street beyond the Bailey Sanitorium, making 0 the turn there and making the return trip to town. f ■ In going from Lincoln to Normal the company agreed to run the busses down to what is now the terminal of the street car line, then back to South Street, to the terminal heretofore mentioned. This ■would give the people living down in that section bus service in lieu of street car service, which is perfectly satisfactory to them, but unless that street from South Street to the tracks of the street car line ig graded, gravelled, or paved, busses could not be run over it and those people living on that line would be denied street car service, which would be a violation of a tentative agreement made at the time street car service to College View was abandoned. The Commission, of course, is not legally bound by any such contract, and does not find it to be all-controlling in this case. The main reason that caused the Traction Company to make appli - cation to make this substitution at the present time, is because the city authorities were requiring them to build a viaduct on Sumner Street at Jefferson Avenue, so that the street could bej opened for traffic, under the Traction Company tracks on Sumner Street, at an expense that would practically be prohibitive, or remove the tracks. The City of Lincoln, should, in our judgment furnish streets and bridges for the Traction Company to run over, as long as the Traction </seg>
            <seg id="p292">. TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Company is required to pay the city a percentage on fares collected. To require the company to furnish the right-of-way, and then pay for the privilege of running over it, is unfair and unjust, in our opin - ion, and the Commission can not see its ' way clear to require the Traction Company to go to that outlay of funds and then pay a license for the privilege of using it. At the conclusion of the hearing the Commissioner ' holding it made this proposition to the city of Lincoln, that whenever they would cause the street from South Street to the present terminal of the street car line to be gravelled or paved, the application of the Trac - tion Company to substitute busses for street cars would be allowed, but until that time the Traction Company would be required to give those people living in the three blocks east of South Street the same service they were receiving at the present time. The Commission therefore finds that the application of the Lincoln Traction Company to discontinue running street cars to Normal and substituting busses therefor, should be denied until such time as the street leading east from South to the present terminal of the street car line be either gravelled or paved, so that busses can be successfully, operated over it. I ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of the Lincoln Traction Company to substitute busses in lieu of Street cars over their lines between the city of Lincoln and Normal be, and the same is, hereby denied and. dismissed without prejudice.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Petitioner herein is a public service corporation which has applied to this Commission for a permit to construct, operate and maintain a new transmission line between Oreapolis and Cedar Creek in Cass County, to be operated as a sixty cycle, three phase alternating current line having a potential of approximately 60,000 volts between wires. Applicant was unable to secure written agreements with the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company as provided by statute 1 and the matter came on for hearing in the offices of the Commission on December 7, 1928. A map showing the proposed location, the side of the highway to be occupied by the new construction and the signal circuits involved in parallel, was attached to the application. | Also specifications which describe the manner of construction in detail as provided by law. The record shows that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com - pany and petitioner are in agreement as to the location and proposed type of construction to be employed as set forth in the application and that the cost of moving certain telephone lines reasonably necessary to the proposed construction have been agreed upon. It also shows that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company does not protest the proposed construction and operation on the condition that the Commission retain its jurisdiction over the service on the signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed construction. The parties at interest were unable to agree in writing as provided by law because of provisions in the agreements relating to the liability of the applicant on account of damages which may arise from negligent construction or operation in the future. These can not be determined at this time. The Commission finds that applicant has complied with the law and the prayer of its petition should be granted, subject to the transmission line rules adopted by this Commission and effective September 5, 1919. The Commission also finds that one year from the date of this order is a reasonable length of time in which to complete the proposed con - struction. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT The Commission will retain its jurisdiction, over the service on the signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed con - struction, and in the event that the service on these lines is interfered -with by prolonged inductive interference resulting from construction and operation of the transmission line, the parties at interest may apply to the Commission for relief as provided by statute. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission pursuant to the provisions of the transmission line law of Nebraska, as amended to date, that the Nebraska Power Company of Omaha, be and the same is hereby permitted to construct, operate and maintain the transmission line described in the application to be operated as a sixty cycle, three phase, alternating current line, having a potential of approximately 66,000 volts between -wires, along the route and in the manner set forth in the application, subject to the terms and conditions of the transmission line rules adopted by this Commission and effective September 5, 1919. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Commission will retain its jurisdiction over the service on the signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed construction, and in the event that the service on these lines is interfered with by prolonged inductive interference resnlting from the construction and operation of the trans - mission line, the parties at interest may apply to the Commission for relief as provided by statute. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that unless the proposed construction is completed within one year from the date of this order, the order shall be null and void.

Agee, general manager. For the Commission— B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: ■ . In this action the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company re - quests authority to publish and collect a revised schedule of rates for service, both town and rural, at its Louisville exchange. The rate schedule proposed is predicated upon a change in the service at this exchange from magneto to common battery in town, and full metallic rural service, the proposed rates not to become effective until such time as applicant is able to furnish the improved service. Hearing upon the. application was held at Louisville in the town hall, at 9 :30 a. in., December 18, 1928. Present and proposed rates are as follows: Present Proposed Business individual .$3.00 $3.75 Residence one party i.50 2.00 Residence two party none 1.75 Farm metallic i 1.50 1.75 Applicant serves approximately 308 subscribers at this exchange, of whom 165 are town and 143 are rural. There has lecently been located at Louisville a new cement factory. It is now in process of construction and will probably be placed in actual operation in the next three or four months. It is an outstand - ing industry in the community. While no witnesses could testify with any degree of exactness, it was estimated that several hundred persons would be employed in the factory and that perhaps 300 additional families would be brought into the community as a result thereof. This probable, large and rapid, growth in the community creates a problem for applicant. Its present facilities to serve are entirely inadequate to meet the expected demand of the immediate future. Accordingly, whether the service remain magneto or be made common battery, the company faces a reconstruction program. Having in mind the fact that such program of reconstruction as it! might now adopt would determine the class of service which these subscribers would receive for a period of future years, applicant deemed it advisable to abandon </seg>
            <seg id="p296">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT • the "nand crank" magneto type service and provide for the more modern common battery service. This program met with the hearty approval of subscribers, both rural and town, as reflected by the fact that petitions were generously signed praying for the change in service, at the rates herein proposed. The petition signed by town subscribers, is as follows: "In order to improve the service the undersigned telephone subscribers of the Louisville, Nebraska, exchange request the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company to change the service from magneto to common battery. In making this request we understand that when the change is made it will be necessary for you to charge the rates for local service which are listed below, and we agree to the payment of these rates: Business one party .-. $3.75 per month Business two party 1.75 per month Residence one party 2.00 per month Business extension ....... 1.00 per month Residence extension 50 per month" Petition signed by rural subscribers is as follows : "In order to improve the service, the undersigned telephone subscribers of Louisville, Nebraska, exchange request the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company to re-group the farm lines to ten subscribers or less on each line. In making this request we understand that when the change is made it will be necessary for you to charge the rate for local service which is listed below, and we agree to the payment of these rates: - Farm : $1.75 per month" The above petitions were signed by 83 'per cent of the city sub - scribers and 77 per cent of the rural subscribers." This seems to definitely indicate a general desire on the part of this citizenry for the higher type telephone service, and a willingness to pay a reasonable rate therefor. Furthermore, the project has been endorsed, accord - ing to testimony, almost unanimously by the Louisville Chamber of Commerce, the only civic organization in town. It is the Commission's conclusion that applicant should be auth - orized to change to the improved service. Louisville is a thriving, growing city, with a prosperous trade territory. With the coming of this new industry it should enjoy a splendid growth in population. It seems proper that telephone service should keep pace with the growth and development of the city, and the demands of the citizens There remains the question of what is a reasonable rate for the proposed service.

These earn - ings give no consideration to additional subscribers which the company may receive as a result of the growth of the town. It wes the com - pany's thought that over a period of four or five years, the number of subscribers probably will increase to the point where the exchange will pay four or five per cent on the book cost of the property. It is quite possible that a critical analysis of applicant's pro - posed expenses might result in' some slight revisions.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: In this action the Union Pacific Railroad, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway and Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad request authority to cancel commodity rates on canned goods applying from Beatrice. The application is predicated oh the fact that the canning factory at Beatrice discontinued operations some several years ago and that, accordingly, the rate is obsolete. Complaints were received from the Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Hastings and Fremont chambers of commerce with respect to granting the rate, in that the Beatrice rate under the long and short haul clause affects rates on the same commodity, from and to certain of these intermediate points. Hearing upon the application was held at Commission offices, February 26, 1929. At the time of hearing, the application was a- - mended by carrier representatives, to provide as follows: "After further consideration, the (Union Pacific and Burling - ton feel that their application should be amended to permit the cancellation of carload commodity rates on canned goods from Beatrice to all points in Nebraska; that in cases where the Beatrice rate is now held as a maximum from intermediate </seg>
            <seg id="p300">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT points such as Lincoln and Fremont, and any other in or/Mediate point, application is hereby made for permission to apply the Beatrice rate from those points as the maximum rate." ■ . ■ With the application as above amended, representatives of shippers withdrew all complaint as to the granting of the request. Ui der these circumstances, it appears that the same should be granted. The rate in question serves no purpose and is obsolete. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska Stat Railway Commission that, effective immediately, the Union Pacific Railroad, C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company be, and the same are, hereby authorized to cancel the commodity rate on canned goods from Beatrice, this authorization to be subject to the provisions of the amended application, as above set forth.

            <seg id="p302">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT in 1928 at a cost of approximately $3,500 complete. The switchboard is located in a new and modern building especially constructed for a central office, which is leased to the applicant. The building also provides a garage, workshop, etc. Nearly all of the telephone instru - ments are new, the old ones having been replaced as rapidly as changes and new installations would permit, thus entirely abandoning obsolete types of equipment and standardizing upon one modern type of equip - ment. When the construction program is completed there will be no open aerial wire in the plant. The proposed rates in so far as city subscribers are concerned are to apply only to metallic service. The grounded service is being entirely eliminated with the new construction. In 1920 applicant served 112 city subscribers and 189 service stations, and on October 31, 1928, 181 city subscribers and 237 service Btations. This rapid increasing demand for telephone service in the city necessitated the extension of telephone equipment and caused a considerable portion of the original plant to become inadequate and obsolete. The telephone system is situated in the midst of a thriving and progressive community where there is a demand for modern telephone service. Applicant has apparently directed its efforts to keep abreast with the development of the community which it serves. Following notice given to all interested parties this matter was heard at Hay Springs, December 12, 1928. Appearance for respond - ents was made by Mr. Will Holstein, the chairman of a committee representing the Hay Springs Improvement Club. The attitude of the business men and perhaps the public in general is expressed in Mr. Holstein's testimony. In response to an inquiry regarding the attitude of the business men he said : "I might say that Mr. Strotheide and Mr. Plummer and myself were appointed by the Chairman of the Hay Springs Rural Improvement Club as a committee to see about the raise in tele - phone rates. They instructed us to be fair and have no kick coming if it was justified in having increase in rates." Mr. Holstein was also asked if there were further facts which might be developed for his committee's benefit and he replied as follows : "I would say this— that after hearing Mr. Horn going over his report and explaining it, that if the Commission, upon investi - ! gation, find that the valuation is all right and after going over j the overhead expense, find that the cost of operation is not too I high for a plant of this size, then I don't have an idea that the community would have any fault to find with the raise in rates. We don't understand the telephone business and have to put that to the Commission, who know more about it than we do." </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The rural subscribers were not represented at the hearing since ■only city subscribers rates are involved m this application. Applicant submits as evidence of the value of its plant, and the net book cost of the property, the following balance sheet statement: BALANCE SHEET OCTOBER 31, 1928. Assets and Debits Total Fixed Investment $14,393.39 Cash (credit) (421.07) 1 Due from Subscribers 141.67 Material &amp; Supplies 217.85 Total Current Assets | (credit) (61.55) Prepayments (credit) (36.34) Total Assets side $14,295.50 Liabilities and Credits * Capital Stock (proprietorship) • $10,000.00 Notes Payable $1,000.00 .

' 354.06 Total Liabilities . $14,295.50 ITrom the above balance sheet and other 1 factors of value applicant reaches the conclusion that it should be entitled to earn upon a value of $15,000. ■ Prior to 1926 when the Commission's accounting department in - stalled an accounting system for the company no record of additions and betterments are available. The basis of the fixed investment account m amount $14,393.39 was determined by the Commission's accounting department from such information as it had available. The Commission recognizes that since the installation of the account - ing system nearly all of the old plant has been replaced with new and modern equipment. In the process of proper accounting the books of account would automatically be adjusted l to the proper cost figure. The Commission is convinced because of these facts that the present book figure of $14,393.39 very nearly represents the original undepre - ciated cost of the physical, plant. The depreciation m. the property is at present not m excess of the amount represented by applicant's depreciation reserve. ■ - </seg>
            <seg id="p304">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT 1x10 capital investment account of $10,000 appearing in the balance sheet represents $6,000 originally paid for the property by the pros - sent owners plus actual dollars invested in the plant for additions and betterments as adduced from, the testimony. The remaining a - mount appearing in the fixed investment account of approximately . $4,400 represents reinvested depreciation and surplus reserves and borrowed money. Applicant's fixed investment account of $14,393.39 we find to rep - resent approximately the historical cost of the property. If allowance was made for working capital and such other contingencies as are uniformly recognized by courts and regulatory commissions in find - ing the fair value of public utilities for rate purposes the rate base herein would probably exceed $14,000. Applicant did not submit evidence relating to all of the various factors 'which must have consideration in finding "fair value." There - fore the Commission will permit applicant to earn, if revenues permit, a return upon $14,000, which is considered as a conservative estimate and not a definite finding of fair value. Upon the basis of the first ten months' experience of 1928 appli - cant finds the average per month and multiplies by twelve to find the company's experience on present rates for 1928, as follows : REVENUES Subscribers Service Revenue $3,861.98 Switching Service . 1,466.28 Toll Revenue 1,042.06 Miscellaneous Revenue 176.47 Total Revenues . . $6,546.79 OPERATING EXPENSE Repairs to Toll Equipment '15.96 Repairs to Exchange Lines . 696.78 Repairs to Central Office Equip. 514.44 Repairs to Subscribers Stations 480.44 ' ' ■': • '1 '■'■ - ■ ■ I Total Tel.

In addition to the loss applicant contends there should be added $318.93 for depreciation which when added to the depreciation shown in the above statement makes a total of $575.73 or 4% of the fixed property. An item of considerable importance in the above revenue and ex - pense statement appears to be the net toll revenue item in amount $1,042-06. As compared to the total amount of exchange revenues the toll revenues are much larger than experienced by other companies of like size in the state. It was learned! from the testimony of the manager that there has been a steady growth in the toll revenues of the company for the past several years, and that it was the expecta - tion that the toll revenues would grow rather than diminish. The item of toll revenue has a considerable bearing upon the application before the Commission. In fact to be able to determine the exact requirements of the applicant as to exchange subscribers' rates it would be necessary to eliminate toll factors from both revenue and expense items. To accomplish this, segregation would entail an elabor - ate study and is a task which is perhaps beyond the reach of the management of this rather small telephone company. It is apparent however without an elaborate study that the operating expense which might be charged direct to toll is far below the net revenue realized therefrom. In other words, the Commission is convinced that if the toll business were eliminated from applicant's operating statement that the exchange rates would necessarily have to bear a larger burden of operating expense than at present. The Commission is not in a position to state from the record at hand the amount of benefit accrued to the exchange subscribers by reason of toll profits, but will give consideration to this factor in arriving at its conclusions. </seg>
            <seg id="p306">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT The item of $1,466:28 listed as switching revenue in the revenue statement is subject to correction due to the method used by applicant to arrive at the figure. The item does not represent accrued revenue since the ten 'months period upon which the computation was based contained only a part of the switching revenue accrued for the period. It is the practice of applicant to enter its switching revenues in total each six months since the same are payable in six months periods. For this reason, less than the actual accrued revenues appear in the statement. We will amend the statement to include one year's service station revenue which upon the basis of the number of subscribers served on October 31, 1928, (237) would be $1,706.40. In the operating expenses is found the total repairs to exchange equipment in the sum of $1,707.62. The lineman is paid $1,380 per annum, which according to the statement would leave $320 per annum, for repair materials and other voucher expense incident to the repairs, provided all of the lineman's time was devoted to maintenance work. The Commission doe's not have the historical data of the applicant company as to maintenance expense to compare with applicant's estimate. However, we are of the opinion that upon the basis of the average experience of many other telephone companies that the main - tenance expense should be less. This is particularly true since the exchange plant which applicant must keep in repair is confined en - tirely to the corporate limits of the village. ; We find $1,600 per annum as a reasonable allowance for maintenance and depreciation. The salaries of the officers and clerks total $1,998.00 per annum. These items, as testified to by the manager of the company are com - pensation for the general managerial duties and for bookkeeping ex - pense. It was further pointed out by applicant that a revision in the methods of accounting with respect to the salary items might be proper, since no rental is paid to the manager of the company for telephone office space in his own office building. The manager also furnishes without additional payment such items as light, heat, letter heads, use of adding machine, etc., all of which might be charged to the telephone company. The salaries may be somewhat above the average for similar duties but the Commission ia disposed to consider also the efficiency of management, service, and the economies of operation, all of which should be encouraged. Under the circumstances we do not find the compensation unreasonable. As has been heretofore mentioned the proposed rates contemplate ■unrestricted 24-hour service. Applicant was not prepared to testify as to the actual additional expense necessary in giving the extended service. At present central office hours are from 5:00 a. m. to 10:00 p. m. From 10 :00 p. m. to 5 :00 a. m. a charge of 15c per call is made. Applicant believed the additional operating expense for the 24-hour service would be from ten dollars to twenty dollars per month, depend - ing upon the length of the time during the 24 hours that an operator </seg>
            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION •would be required to be constantly on duty. We will add VJtuu u Oi annum for this purpose. In line with the foregoing correction's and reasoning we find, for the purposes of this case only^ the following expense statement rep - resents applicant's reasonable future requirements.. Maintenance and Depreciation $1,600.00 Operators Wages 1,563.60 • Operators Wages (additional 1929) ! *18o!oO Salaries of Officers $1,200.00 Rents 432.00 Salaries of Clerks 798.00 Stationery and Printing 93.84 Office Supplies and Expenses 205.42 Other General Expense 177.42 Total General Expense 2,906.68 Total Operating Expense $6,662 82 Taxes ISoieo J ■ Total $6,813.42 The original revenue statement, as stated, should be amended to include additional switching revenue in amount $240.12. This would bring total revenues, including toll to $6,786.91. Upon the basis of these calculations and present rates an annual operating loss would be experienced in the sum of $26.51. The proposed rates, upon the basis of the number of subscribers served October 31, 1928, would yield additional revenue in the sum of $876.00. The net remaining for dividends under the proposed rate would be $849.49, which is approximately 6% on $14,000. The rates applied for are found reasonable in all respects and the application will be approved.

BY THE COMMISSION: Application No. 7576 was filed on December 18, 1928, on behalf of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Com - pany, by F. Montmorency, chairman Nebraska lines, and requested au - thority to publish a rate of- 28 cents on canned goods from Omaha, Ne - braska to Hastings. This authority was granted on December 28, effective Febrnary 1, 1929. Application No. 7585 was filed on December 22, 1928, by F. Mont - morency, general freight agent of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., and sought authority to publish a 28-cent rate from Omaha to Grand Island and Central City, and from Fremont and Columbus to Hastings and Grand Island, based on the rate as authorized m Application No. 7576 by reason of the fact that the rate from Omaha to Hastings, via the Un - ion Pacific, applied from intermediate points on the Union Pacific and some of those intermediate points were common points with the C. B. &amp; Q. and m order to meet this competition it would be necessary to establish the same rate via the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. from these common points. This application was granted January 2, 1929, to become effective February 1, 1929, on the same date that Application No. 7576 was to become effective. On January 14, 1929, after several complaints had been filed against the proposed rates as granted m Application No. 7576 and 7585, the Commission entered a supplementary order to these two appli - cations setting aside and cancelling the orders entered m the first in - stance and upon complaint of the Grand Island Chamber of Commerce, the Hastings Chamber of Commerce and others, these applications were set down for formal hearing on January 29, 1929, before the Commis - sion, at which time the interested parties appeared before this Commis - sion and presented their testimony. </seg>
            <seg id="p310">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT xhe testimony of Mr. Charles Axtell, on behalf of. the applicant, showed that there is a 38y 2 -cent rate on canned goods from Kansas City to Hastings, a 34-cent rate from Omaha to Hastings and Grand Island, and a fifth class rate of 37 cents from Omaha to Hastings and Grand Island ; that in the reverse direction, Hastings and Grand Island to Omaha, there is a canned goods rate of 18y 2 cents, which may be used by jobbers at those points as well as the canners; that there are "canners' rates" from other jobbing points east bound which are con - siderably lower than the west bound rates; tbat the jobbers at Hast - ings and Grand Island can use rule 10 in the current classification for shipments of canned goods the same as is used by the Omaha jobbers; that the Omaha jobbers first requested the present east bound rates for west bound movements, which was later changed to the 28-cent rate and that in his opinion the proposed rate was reasonable when com - pared with the present rate from Kansas City, using as a basis the principle laid down in the Southwestern cades as to the relationship of canned goods to the first class rate. Mr. A. B. Tebbens, of the McCord-Brady Company, located in Omaha, stated that his firm had requested the rate in the first instance on west bound movements to the 18 cent east bound rate basis, but later indicated that a 28 cent rate west bound would be satisfactory. This witness also stated that at the present time most of their ship - ments to Hastings moved under rule 10 of the classification, but that if this rate were established they would move about three times as many straight cars of canned goods as are being moved at the present time. Witness also stated that about 70% of their total movement of .canned goods is under rule 10 of the classification. , Mr. E. P. Ryan, on behalf of the protestants,. stated that there were no objections to the proposed rate of 28 cents in that it was an unreasonable one but that their objections were, that this rate would only take care of the adjustment from Omaha to Hastings and Grand Island and intermediate points and therefore the application should not be allowed unless the rate adjustment for the entire territory was made at the same time. In other words, the protestants desired specific commodity rates on canned goods from Hastings and' Grand Island, both to the west and the' east. Mr. G. J. Olson, appearing on behalf of- the protestants, also stated that they were not objecting to the proposed rate of 28 cents as an unreasonable one, but that they were objecting to the effect that the publishing of this rate would have on the jobbing business of Hastings. Mr. Olson also wanted commodity rates established from all Nebraska canning points to Hastings and from Hastings to all jobbing points in all directions, if this* 28 cent rate from Omaha was allowed to go into effect. Mr. E. E. dishing of Hastings, appearing on behalf of the protest- </seg>
            <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ants, testified that he had been in the wholesale business at Hastings for thirty years; that he sells canned goods in all directions in com - petition with other jobbers throughout Nebraska; that he ships in car - joad lots and some 1. c. 1. lots. Mr. Gushing also testified that he receives about 35% of his canned goods from the west; about 35-40% from the east; that most of the inbound business is in carload lots. This witness also stated that he was not attacking the proposed rate as being an unreasonable one but was more concerned with the relation - ship of rates, aud that if this rate were allowed to go into effect it would just about put the Hastings jobbers out of the wholesale business. Mr. R. W. Updike of Grand Island, who is in the canning business, appeared on behalf of the protestants and stated that he "wanted the same rate, relatively, to points west of Grand Island as proposed to Grand Island and Hastings. He also stated that he wanted a commodi - ty rate from Grand Island established to the same territory that the proposed rate would affect, altho his testimony showed that pract - ically 85% of his entire output moved to points west of Grand Island rather than to the east, with about 15% moving into Grand Island proper on a switching rate of $6.30 per car. Mr. N. F. Davies, appearing on behalf of the protestants, stated that he has houses located at Grand Island and Columbus and that his position is the same as witness Cushing. ■ He also stated that he was not contesting the reasonableness of the proposed rate but wanted a readjustment of the rates to other points. In his testimony the point was finally brought out that he sells only to retailers and most of his commodities move on the less carload basis. CONCLUSIONS The filing of these applications by the defendants was for the ex - press purpose of securing authority froin this body to establish a reduced rate on canned goods, carloads, from Omaha and intermediate points to Hastings and Grand Island and' intermediate points. These applications were granted without the necessity of a formal hearing by reason of the fact that they carried ] a reduction in the present rates and had' been agreed to by the Omaha shippers and carriers and it has always been the practice of this Commission to grant such applications without holding a formal hearing, when the changes were agreeable to the interested parties and were in the nature of a reduction. In our opinion the only question involved is whether or not the pro - posed rate is a reasonable one. We cannot subscribe to the proposi - tion that the entire rate adjustment on canned goods to and from all points in Nebraska should be brought 'into review on this application. Protestants have a proper recourse if they desire an investigation into the rate structure on canned goods. </seg>
            <seg id="p312">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT The Commission on this record, does not find that the establish - ment of this rate will eventually force some of the jobbers located at Hastings and Grand Island out of the wholesale business. The job - bers at Grand Island are now able to secure certain canned goods from the canning factory located at Grand Island on a very low switch - ing rate of $6.30 per car and then can move these same goods with other canned goods to points east of Grand Island on an 18»/ 2 cent rate, whereas under the present adjustment the movement from Omaha under rule 10 of the Classification, would have to take a 37-cent rate, a rate twice as great as the rate in the reverse direction, which rate would also apply from Grand Island and Hastings to Omaha if this 18V 2  - cent rate were not in effect. ' In our opinion, the proposed rate to Grand Island -and Hastings would not place the Omaha jobbers on the same level as the Grand Island and Hastings jobbers on shipments west of Grand Island and Hastings, due to the advantage in distance now enjoyed by the Grand Island and Hastings shippers. The interstate adjustment referred to in the record is one over which we have no jurisdiction and will not be discussed. From the evidence submitted, it would appear that no one has questioned the reasonableness of the proposed rate and this being the only point at issue, we are of the opinion and so find that the proposed rate of 28 cents per 100 pounds on canned goods from Omaha and intermediate points to Hastings and Grand Island and intermediate points is not an unreasonable one and that the application should be granted. An appropriate order will therefore be entered. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, and the Union Pacific Railroad Company, be and the same are hereby authorized and directed to publish, effective not later than thirty days from the date hereof, a rate of 28 cents per 100 pounds on carload shipments of canned goods, from Omaha and intermediate points to Grand Island and Hast - ings and intermediate points. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quin - cy Railroad Company, be permitted to publish the same twenty-eight - cent rate from Fremont and Columbus, and intermediate points to Hastings and Grand Island, and intermediate points. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the term "canned goods" shall apply to those articles as described in various tariffs and that the minimum weight shall be 36,000 pounds. </seg>

B. &amp; Q. Rail - road Company to publish the same 28-cent rate from Fremont to Columbus and intermediate points to Hastings and Grand Island and intermediate points. Petition has been filed by E. P. Ryan of Grand Island, represent - ing certain petitioners, praying for postponement of the effective date of the order and for rehearing, on the grounds that proper considera - tion had not been given by the Commission to the protestants' allega - tions of discrimination resulting from the publication of the rate pro - posed, and that the Commission's order goes beyond the province of the subject matter involved in increasing rates at intermediate points. The position of petitioners has been carefully considered by the Commission, and conclusion is reached that there is no occasion for reopening the case. </seg>
            <seg id="p314">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT It is axiomatic that the Commission, in its deliberations respect - ing the establishment of rates, is obliged to give consideration not only to the reasonableness of the rate, but also to unjust discrimination which may result therefrom. In the instant case, the question of unjust discrimination resulting from the authorization of these proposed re - duced rates, was considered by the Commission. Based upon the facts of record, and the Commission's further familiarity with the rates proposed in their relationship to other rates, the Commission did not feel that unjust discrimination would result. Accordingly, the reduced rates, being admitted as reasonable by respondents themselves, and further, so found by the Commission after a careful review of all the facts, were authorized. The second contention of protestants is well made. The Commis - sion has gone beyond the subject matter before it in directing the application of the Omaha rate for intermediate points. In this respect, the Commission is in error, the application having to do primarily - with rates from Omaha to Hastings, Central City and Grand Island. Nothing in the application or in the testimony would indicate that intermediate rates were involved. In Application No. 7553 wherein the Commission authorized the cancellation of commodity rates on canned goods from Beatrice, it was ' stipulated that Beatrice rates should apply as a maximum from intermediate points where involved, to Hastings and Grand Island. The rates from intermediate points should not have been disturbed in the original order herein. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that, in so far as the provisions of the original order herein related to rates on carload shipments of canned goods, to points other than from Omaha to Hastings, Central City, and Grand Island, the same be and they are hereby canceled and annulled. ■ Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-fourth day of June, 1929.

I CURTISS, Commissioner: The above listed applications are filed by the companies respect - ively, as set forth, and all relate to the same subject matter, i. e., the publication of revised schedule of toll rates for intrastate traffic, .the same to become effective February first, next. Since the proposed changes are in effect the same in each application, it appears that one discussion will suffice. Such changes as are proposed result in reduced toll rates. No changes are proposed for calls moving less than 128 miles. Reductions in. calls intrastate, beyond 128 miles, range from five cents to twenty - five cents on both station-to-station and person-to-person service. No change is made in the relationship of report and overtime charges to initial rates. Evening and night station-to-station rate's are not changed, except in a few instances, where, as a result of a change in mileage steps, the charges are made five cents lower. A further reduction results in the elimination of separate rate classifications for messenger and appointment calls. The application contemplates the handling of such calls at person-to-person rates, except. that actual cost of messenger service will be added as hereto - fore. All changes which are proposed result advantageously to the public. There appears to be no occasion for a public hearing. Ac - cordingly, an order •will be entered.

North 23rd Street from Vine to Holdrege was not paved and it necessitated routing the busses over 22nd street from Vine to </seg>
            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ■■'"■■ •' PIHfi___._ Holdrege, as 22nd Street -was paved and the company could not operate busses over the same route that the street cars have been operated, which brought about the change of routing at that time. While there was no written promise 'of a restoration of service on North 23rd Street between Vine and Holdrege, there was a tentative understanding that whenever 23rd Street J between Vine and Holdrege was paved, the traction company would restore service on 23rd Street, in lieu of the routing which was required at the time the change was made from 23rd to 22nd Street. During the summer of 1928, North 23rd Street between Vine and Holdrege Street was paved so that it is practical to run busses over the route formerly used by the traction company and service on that _ line could be restored providing the traction company made application for restoration. - On January 11, 1929, the Lincoln Traction Company made ap - plication to restore service on 23rd Street in place of 22nd Street in. the following words and language, to wit: "We are requesting the re-routing of the Agricultural Col - lege bus line over 23rd street. You will no doubt recall at the time of. our hearing before your Honorable Body, to abandon street oar service, on 23rd Street to Holdrege Street and the East S line, that it was understood that bus service should be . operated over 23rd Street in the event that street was paved between Y and Holdrege. We are therefore asking your permis - sion to re-route our Agricultural College bus line, beginning at 22nd and Vine and continuing east on Vine to 23rd Street, thence north on 23rd Street to Holdrege Street and continuing the present routing on Holdrege Street, the same as is now being operated." There has been quite a considerable demand on the Commission, from the residents on North 23rd street for the restoration of the service on that street and as the people; have paved the street and made it possible now for busses to operate on that street, the Com - mission is of the opinion and so finds that service should be restored on 23rd Street in lieu of the present routing over 22nd Street and the company will be permitted and required, to make such change, in order to restore to the people on 23rd Street service that they pre - viously enjoyed when the company was furnishing street car service.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: . , This matter involves the application of the Washington and West - ern Telephone" Company at Verdigre, and the Ponca Valley Telephone Company of Verdel, for authority to discontinue the use of kiuf e switches installed and used by the Pishelville Short Line Company. The 'Pishelville Short Line Company is situated south of the Niob - rara river beyond the territory of the Ponca Valley Telephone Company and has in the past received switching service without charge from the Ponca Valley Telephone Company. The Ponca Valley Telephone Com - pany has one rural circuit extended to the two subscribers in and about an inland locality called "Pishelville." In the home of one of these sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION scribers a knife switch is" installed with which he is able to connect telephone messages from the farmers' lines through to Verdel and to- Verdigre. Under the existing arrangement the Ponca Valley Telephone Company is giving service to thirty -four service station subscribers without charge. The Pishelville Short Line Company does not operate a switchboard. The Washington and Western Telephone Company at Verdigre also has a farm line extending to Pishelville, which is about twenty - four miles in length, and upon this line the farmers have two knife switches. By means of these switches various farm line subscribers in the territory are able to transfer messages to either Verdel. or Verdigre and have made no payment for the switching service. The ■ manager of the telephone company at Verdigre pointed out to the Com - mission that there were twenty-one subscribers on its farm line extend - ing to Pishelville and that when the. knife switches were connected, there were an additional thirty-four subscribers on the line making a total of fifty-four subscribers which were connected on the same grounded farm 'line. Such an arrangement makes good telephone service impossible. The only theory advanced by the farm line subscribers which, pointed to any compensation for the use of the switchboard and oper - ating facilities of the two applicant companies was that the arrange - ment • constituted an interchange of service. It developed, however, at the hearing that there were only thirty -four farm line subscribers - involved as compared to 330 subscribers at Verdigre, and slightly in. excess of 200 at Verdel. In addition, the testimony shows that the applicant companies herein are furnishing the switchboard service, the operators, etc., without any compensation. ) ■ • ■ I ■•.'■■■ It is apparent to the Commission that the subscribers of the Pish - elville Short Line Company have been receiving telephone service and. enjoying the operating facilities of the applicant companies herein without proper compensation. Uniformly throughout the state, farm - line subscribers owning their own lines and equipment pay to the com - pany who furnishes them the switchboard | service a so-called switch - ing rate and are classed as service station subscribers who pay a. stipulated monthly rate for this expense. At the hearing held in this matter at Verdel, a representative of the Pishelville Short Line company testified that the Pishelville com - pany would be willing and ready to pay a just and reasonable charge for such services. However, since the hearing, the company has de - cided that it would not care to pay any rate for such service to either Verdel or Verdigre. Both of the applicant companies, however, are very willing to .furnish switching service at a regular and proper switching rate, if the farm line companies wish it. </seg>
            <seg id="p320">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Under the circumstances, the Commission will grant the applicants herein authority to discontinue present so-called free service to the Pishelville company subscribers and, in accordance with a regular and uniform practice, will grant applicants the right to charge subscri - bers of the jPishelville Short Line Company six dollars per year, pay - able quarterly in advance, provided such subscribers elect to avail themselves of this service. The rate herein authorized for switching service is one that has been found equitable and just following exten - sive study of the actual cost involved in giving the service.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: The above applications are filed respectively by the Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph Company, and request authority to provide a rate for metallic farm line service at its Saronville, Fairmont and Grafton exchanges. At the present time applicant has a rate of $1.50 per month for grounded service at each of these exchanges. It has no rate on file ■with the Commission for metallic rural service. It is stated that present service furnished subscribers at these exchanges, that is, rural grounded, is unsatisfactory, due to cross-talk and inductive interference. The Commission is aware of the constant development of the rural electric transmission line and recognizes the difficulty of furnishing efficient farm line service over a grounded circuit, where such telephone lines are paralleled by transmission lines] The Commission has on numerous occasions, authorized a rate of $1.75 per month for farm line metallic service, under conditions not dissimilar to those surrounding the furnishing of rural service at the exchanges named. Applicant has no intention' of forcing the higher grade service .upon farm line subscribers ■where they do not desire it at the rate proposed herein. However, it is stated that, at each of these exchanges, there are rural subscribers who are desirous of the improved service and are willing to pay such reasonable rate as is necessary. Under these circumstances, it is the Commission's opinion that the rate can be authorized without the necessity of a formal hearing. The Commis - sion's order will provide that the change from grounded to metallic service, at the higher rate, shall not be made by applicant until a preference for the higher type service has been expressed by not less than two-thirds of the subscribers on the rural line affected.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 7648 ',.-.■■ ■ In the matter of the application of the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone Company of Nelson, for authority to establish rural metallic rates of $1.75 per month at all exchanges. OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This application is presented by the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone Company, requesting authority to provide a rate of $1.75 for rural metallic service. The rate proposed is in the nature of a new filing and covers a class of farm line service not now rendered by this company. Applicant serves the following exchanges, namely, Nelson, Ruskin, Oak, Angus, Nora, Hardy and Mt. Clare. .. The application recites the fact that in the territory served by these different exchanges, a network of electric transmission lines has been constructed. As a result, farm line service is badly, disrupted by inductive interference from these high powered transmission lines. Applicant alleges that it is impossible to remove or overcome this in - ductive interference on farm lines which are of grounded construction. Accordingly, it proposes the above named rate for the metallic rural service for such farm lines as may desire the improved service. The change from grounded to metallic service is to be at the option of farm </seg>
            <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION line subscribers. Under no circumstances is the improved service to be obligatory upon farm line subscribers who are satisfied with service as given over grounded lines. Having in mind the fact that the service is optional and that the farm line subscribers need not take the improved service at the higher rate unless they so desire, the Commission, feels that 'the request should be granted. It has authorized a similar rate in many instances for high grade rural metallic service. In the instant case, farm line con - struction will be of -high standard and the service will undoubtedly be very materially improved. It is the Commission's opinion that the change from grounded to metallic service should not be made except in those instances where not less than two-thirds of the farm line subscribers have expressed in writing a desire for the metallic service. Under the circumstances above set forth, it is the Commission's opinion that the request may be granted without the necessity of a formal hearing. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by this Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone Company be and the same is hereby authorized and directed, effective immedi - ately, to publish and collect an optional | rural metallic rate at its following exchanges, namely, Nelson, Ruskin, Oak, Angus, Nora, Hardy and Mt.

' IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the' securing of metallic farm line service is optional with the subscriber on the farm line, and that such service shall not be provided by applicant herein until not less than two-thirds of the subscribers on any farm line shall have ex - pressed a desire in writing for such improved service.

Appearances : . For the applicant — Mrs. Ida M. Bartunek, O'NeUl. ■ For the Commission — • B. E. Forbes, chief engineer,- Walter V. Huston, bus clerk. OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This application is presented by Pioneer Bus Line of O'Neill, a Nebraska corporation, for authority to issue and sell $10,000 of its stock. Hearing upon the application was held at Commission offices, March 8, 1929. . ■■ Applicant proposes to operate bus lines between Grand Island and O'Neill, O'Neill and Sioux City, O'Neill anji Valentine and Valentine and Chadron. Busses have been previously operated over these routes by Mrs. Ida Bartunek, an individual, as follows: O'Neill to Sioux City, distance of approximately 135 miles, from July 3, 1928, to January 3, 1929. O'Neill to Valentine, distance of approximately 153 miles, from July 3, 1928, to January 3, 1 1929. Valentine to Chad - ron, distance of approximately 152 miles, from July 3, 1928 to January 3, 1929. O'Neill to Grand Island, a distance of approximately 148 mile?, from January 1, 1928, to January 3, 1929. A portion of the O'Neill-Grand Island route has been operated continuously since January, 1928, i.e., from Grand Island to Bartlett. In the conduct of this bus business four sedan automobiles, ' consisting of two Buicks, a Hudson and a Nash', have been used. It is proposed to turn over to the corporation, all assets, tangible and intangible, including busses and such good will and going con - cern value as now exists in the above named properties operated by Mrs. Bartunek. In exchange for these properties, Mrs. Bartunek con - templates taking stock of the corporation. Having in mind the Stock and Bonds Act, the Commission must find, if this stock is to be authorized, that it is "necessary for the acquisition of property, the construction, 1 completion, extension or improvement of facilities, or for the improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations", and that, in the Commission's opinion, "the use of the capital to be secured by the issue of such stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of </seg>
            <seg id="p326">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT indebtedness, is reasonably, required for the said purposes of the corporation". .'•'••• This brings the Commission to a discussion of the value of the property which is to bo acquired by the corporation and against which securities are to be issued. The only tangible property which comes into the possession of the corporation, is the busses. The cars are all seven-passenger sedans. The Nash was bought new at a cost of $2,300. The two Buicks were bought second-hand, each of them having been run but a few hundred miles, at a cost of $1,500 each. The Hudson was also second-liaud, had been run but a few hundred miles when purchased, and cost $1,600. Witness Bartunek was unable to advise as to the exact miles on the used cars at the time of purchase, but stated that they were all in splendid condition. She also stated that the cars had been well maintained, each of the drivers being a mechanic himself, and that they, were now in serviceable condition and could be operated for many thousand more miles. The total original cost of the cars was $6,900. Against them there is still an obligation of $1,200. Having in mind the approximate number of days they have been driven and the mileage per day, there hasbeen not less than 30,000 additional miles put on each car under present ownership. It is probable that they are not worth much in excess of the obligations against them. No money was spent in the securing of franchise rights in the cities and villages through which the busses are routed. Applicant, however, stresses particularly the good will and going concern value. Witness Bartunek states that she has devoted her undivided attention during' the months when the busses were being operated, to building up the business. Each community was personally visited and its citizens urged to use the bus. As a result of such effort, it was pointed out that the revenue realized each month increased constantly until traffic was disturbed by serious drouth conditions in certain portions of the territory served, and a general flu epidemic. For these reasons and these only, it is claimed, traffic became so re - duced as to make necessary the abandonment of the busses as above set forth during the winter months. Applicant makes very generous claims of value for services rendered in promoting the business, ad - vertising and other effort necessary in making the approximately 600 miles of daily operation, serving something like fifty towns, a going concern. The Commission recognizes this service as a necessary effort in the establishing of a bus business, and a thing of value which can properly be capitalized, subject, however, to reasonable limitations. Witness Bartunek stated that she personally had put into the business in excess of $10,000 of her own money. Having actually put this money into the business, it was her thought that it was evidence sufficient to justify the request for authority to issue capital stock </seg>
            <seg id="p327">NEBRASKA STATE EAILWAY COMMISSION in an equivalent amount. The Commission cannot adopt this meory. The fact that money has been invested is not all conclusive in deter - mining the amount of value for capitalization purposes. The Commission cannot justify an 'authorization of stock in amount $10,000. It feels that there is no jsuch value attached to the property, tangible and intangible, which is to be passed to the corpor - ation. Furthermore, it is skeptical as to 'the possibility of the lines in question being made paying lines in the (immediate future. Certain of the territory served is sparsely settled. Continuous and certain service, because of bad road conditions and unfavorable weather during periods of the year, is difficult to render; at best. The Commission knows of no regular heavy traffic between any of the points served. The experience of Mrs. Bartunek in the months she has operated, has not been a happy one financially, nor is', there anything in it that augurs success for the future. It appears to the Commission to be a highly speculative venture. Witness Bartunek is highly optimistic of the future. She is con - fident that the different communities served will rally to the support of the bus industry and that with the pioneering which she has done, it will immediately prosper and succeed. She points out the rather limited passenger, train service across Nebraska from Chadron to O'Neill and the entire absence of passenger train service connecting directly the towns O'Neill and Grand Island. She stated that the citizens of the towns and. villages through which the lines pass are clamoring for this service ; that they are so intent upon the service that in instances they have volunteered to purchase stock that the busses may continue to run. The Commission does not feel that its judgment should be sub - stituted entirely for that of others who may be willing to invest their money in what should be recognized as a questionable venture. It will authorize an issue of- stock in amount of $2,500 which is found to be the fair value of all properties now devoted to the bus business, in connection with the service herein discussed. Transfer of all proper - ties by Mrs. Bartunek, to the corporation, shall be reflected by bill of sale. The order will require that no stock shall be issued and sold by the corporation until such bill of sale, transferring ownership of all properties herein discussed, shall have been entered. Present' plans of applicant contemplate operation of all bus lines as above set forth, effective April 1st, next. Applicant stated that the stock could; be sold in a block to net not less than 85. The amount of the securities to be issued is small and the success of the venture questionable. Accordingly, the Com - mission will not criticise this discount but will require that stock sold shall net not less than this amount. It will also require that of the </seg>
            <seg id="p328">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT twenty-five shares of stock to be issued and sold, not less than twelve shares shall be sold for cash. The revenue realized from the sale of this stock shall be applied immediately to liquidation of obligations now outstanding against bus equipment. It is impossible from the record to make definite requirements respecting depreciation. However, ap - plicant will be expected to provide, in so far as is possible, out of operating revenue, amounts sufficient to cover depreciation in the busses used in the service.

            <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Service at present is as follows: Westbound, mixed train jmo. vt leaves O'Fallons 6:50 a. m., arrives Northport 3:40 p. m. Freight train. No. 99 leaves Northport 5 p. m., arrives Gering 7 p. m. Eastbound, freight train No. 100 leaves Gering at 1 p. m., arrives Northport 3 p. m. Mixed train No. 98 leaves Northport 7 a. m., arrives O'Fallons 2:26 p. in. Each o£ these trains, both eastbound and westbound are daily except Sunday. The proposal contemplates the running of train No. 97 through from O'Fallons to Gering instead of stopping the same at Northport, thereby eliminating present train No. 99 between Northport and Gering; also, it contemplates starting train No. 98 at Gering rather than at Northport, thereby eliminating train No. 100 between Gering and Northport. The result of this change in service will be to give thorough service between Gering and North Platte daily, whereas under present schedules there are no' train connections i eastbound out of Northport •with No. 100, on the same day. It would seem that the change in these schedules would' result in an improved service. The Commission knows of no objections which might be offered to the changes-pro - posed. Accordingly, an order will be entered for a trial period of 60 days. . If, during the 60-day trial period, no complaints as to the service are offered, the order will automatically become permanent; otherwise, the' matter will be set down for hearing and further con - sideration given the matter by the Commission. ORDER ' IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that, effective immediately, Union Pacific Railroad Com - pany be and the same is hereby authorized to revise its schedules of freight train service between O'Fallons and Gering, in accordance with the schedules set forth in the application herein. IT IS FURTHER DIRECTED that Jthe provisions of the order herein shall continue of force and effect for a period of 60 days ending May 5, 1929, the same to be continued of) force and effect indefinitely after that date, if, during that period complaints are not received by the Commission concerning this subject matter.

CHAIRMAN CURTISS PRESIDING. OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on to be heard at the offices of the Commission, March 29, 1929, on the application of the Central Nebraska Telephone Company for authority to issue its common capital stock in the amount of $350,000 and to issue and sell its bonds. in the par amount of $185,000. .Prior to the hearing, the application was amended to pro - vide only for the issue and sale of 600 shares of its common capital stock of the par value of $100 each. Applicant company is organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Delaware and has complied .with the laws of the state of Nebraska. It has an authorized capital stock of $500,000 divided into 5,000 shares of the par value of $100 each. The articles provide that the company will be engaged in the business of purchasing and selling, owning and operating telephone properties. Petitioner represents to the Commission that it proposes to buy the telephone exchanges located at and serving the villages of Grant, Venango, Imperial, Palisade, Dickens, Wellfleet, Brady and territory adjacent thereto, all of which are located in the state of Nebraska. Petitioner further represents that the stock applied for. under the amended application will be issued and sold to net the applicant not less than par, in money or property. The testimony of the chief accountant of the Commission shows that the estimated cost of the fixed property of the above exchanges amounts to the sum of $92,934.21 for the year ended December 31, 1928, divided among the exchanges as follows: Wettfleet $5,626.07; Venango $22,978.79; Imperial $13,791.17; Palisade $11,904.50; Grant $7,621.38 and Brady, including Maxwell $31,012.30. </seg>
            <seg id="p331">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION These figures are necessarily approximate and while they ajre intended to represent the cost of the property as of the time of place - ment the starting figures were estimates! made by a representative of the accounting department of the Commission in cooperation -with the owners of the property, at the time the Commission accounting system was installed at each of the exchanges, some eight or nine years ago. A sincere attempt was made to arrive at the quantities of the property at each exchange and cost units were applied which were intended to represent the experience" of the owning company. Since that time the various companies have reported additions and betterments to the fixed property as provided under the rules of the Commission's ac - counting system installed and the above figures include the additions to plant as of December 31, 1928. These) exchanges also have current assets in the total amount of $12,249.27l and including certain debit items in the amount of $1,500.00. The reports show total assets in the amount of $106,683.48. While the cost of the fixed property is necessarily approximate, it is also conservative and does not include any franchises, going con - cern or other intangibles not represented !by money actually expended for these purposes. Neither does it include any appreciation on pro - perty placed prior to the period of high prices incidental to the war. On the liabilities side of the consolidated balance sheet of the above companies, we find stock issued and outstanding in the amount of $39,360. Funded debt in the sum of $10,012 and notes payable in the sum of $9,023.72. A reserve for depreciation has also been ac - cumulated in the amount of $29,094.28. I Other items of less impor - tance complete the balancing figure. The operating statement also prepared by the telephone depart - ment of the Commission shows that the above companies have gross revenues in the sum of $30,773.04 and expenses in the sum of $24,311. - 54 or telephone operating income in the) amount of $6,461.50 before taxes, interest and miscellaneous charges. After all expenses have been paid the statement shows that there'is approximately $3,700 for credit to surplus. These exchanges own and operate 1 1,220 telephones. Also 86 telephones which are owned by the subscribers and operated with company, equipment. Further there are !392 subscribers on the ex - changes who receive switching service. The Commission will not attempt to find the value of the above properties for the purpose of this case, because all of the data neces - sary to find such a figure is not available at this time, but the Commis - sion does believe and so finds, that the property is worth at least as much as the capital prayed for and that the issuance and sale of the above securities as applied for is reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation. </seg>

            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on to be heard on the application of the Central States Electric Company of Walthill, for a| permit to construct, operate and maintain a new transmission line south and west of Rosalie, in Thurston County, to be operated as a sixty cycle, single phase, alter - nating current line, having a potential of approximately 6,600 volts between wires. Applicant was unable to agree in writing with the Bancroft Telephone Company whose lines would be involved in parallel by the proposed construction. However, it was agreed between the parties at interest, at the hearing, that the proposed construction would |take place and that any interference with the service on the lines operated by the telephone company resulting from the proposed parallel, and the necessary investigations and ways and means of correcting the same, and the expense thereof, would be left to the dis- • cretion of the Commission. Applicant has filed a map which shows the location of the line by legal subdivisions, the side of the the highway to he occupied by the new construction and the location arid extent of telephone and tele - graph lines that will be involved in parallel and crossings. Specifica - tions have also been filed with the application which show the manner of construction in detail as provided by law. The Commission finds that applicant has complied with the law and the prayer of its petition should be granted, subject to the terms and conditions agreed to at the hearing,| and the transmission line rules adopted by this Commission and effective September 5, 1919. The Commission also finds that six months from the date of this order, is a reasonable length of time in which to complete the proposed construction. The Commission will retain its jurisdiction over the service on the signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed construction, and in the event that the service on those lines is inter - fered with by prolonged inductive interference resulting from the con - struction and operation of the transmission line, the party at interest may apply to the Commission for relief as agreed at the hearing.

            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION OPINION AND FINDING &lt;3URTISS, Chairman: This application is presented by Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quinoy Railroad Company, requesting authority to include Ralston within the switching district of Omaha and South Omaha. ■ • • . I Hearing upon the application was held in the commissioners' as - sembly room of the .Douglas County court house, Omaha, on Monday, April. 29, 1929, the above noted appearances being made. Delay in -entering, final order has been at request! of applicant, which desired additional time to work out the necessary tariff provisions, the same having been but recently filed with the Commission. I Ralston is now a station carried in the Burlington's official table of distances. The application contemplates no change in the quantity of passenger or freight train service rendered at this point; neither will the hours of service at the station be diminished. The agent will operate as a sub-Omaha agent. Ralston! industries will be placed in Rate District No. 5 of the switching district of Omaha, and will also be listed as being within the South Omaha switching district. . While Ralston is not actually a parti of corporate Omaha, the in - dustrial development between these communities is in a large measure a continuous one. A number of large industries are served at this point. Applicant points out the fact that if the request be granted rates will be both increased, and. reduced, in that Omaha rates will govern. Omaha being a key point, rates will be reduced to and from points east of the Missouri river, whereas rates will be increased to and from points in Nebraska, except on movements jbetween what is now Omaha and Ralston, where rates will be materially reduced. If the application be granted, applicant proposes a switching rate of iy 2 cents per hundred pounds, minimum 1 $6.30 per car, between its industries in Rate District No. 5 and connections with other lines, moving under Note A, Item 4, of Switching Tariff No. 26-F, and 1% cents per hundred pounds, minimum $8.10, where traffic moves under Note B of the same tariff. The same charges will be applicable with respect to traffic moving to and from South Omaha and industries, in what is now Ralston. A. J. England, a large feeder, served from this point, endorsed the proposed change. H. D. Bergen of the Omaha Chamber of Com - merce, speaking on behalf of Barker-Evans Paint Company, Howard Stove &amp; Furnace Works, and Orchard-Wilhelm Furniture Company, enthusiastically approved the proposed change. John A. Kuhn of the Omaha Grain Exchange also favored the proposal. No one appeared protesting the proposal. </seg>
            <seg id="p336">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT me Commission finds that, the request should be granted. As noted above, the industrial development in this section is really a part of the industrial development of Omaha. The change, in the main, appears to be markedly advantageous to shippers located at this point. Under the circumstances, there seems to be no reason, why Ralston, for transportation purposes, should not be regarded as a part of and included in the switching district of Omaha and South Omaha. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the' Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy. Railroad Company be, and the same is hereby authorized and directed, effective not later than January 1, 1930, to revise and amend its tariffs in such a manner as to include -what is now known as Ralston, within the switching district of Omaha and South Omaha, and to list as in accordance with, proposed tariffs now filed with the Commission, Ralston industries as being within the Omaha- South Omaha switching district, and to carry such industries in its switching tariff No. 26-F; also, to remove the station of Ralston from its Table of Official Distances No. 9000-B and 10,777-A and to cancel any and all class and commodity rates published specifically between (to, or / and from) Ralston and other stations in Nebraska.

Hearing was set down for May 10, 1929, at 10 o'clock a. m., at Exeter. After due notices had been sent to all subscribers in the Exeter exchange area, and hearing was held on May 10, 1929. The present and proposed rates are as follows : ". ■■'■ I j " ■ Present Proposed Individual business J....$3.00 $3.75 Individual residence i 1.75 2.00 Two party residence ! 1.50 . 1.75 Farm residence !.... 1.50 1.75 The application recites the fact that at the present time it 4s furnishing magneto telephone service. Its central offices have been located in rented quarters up stairs over business rooms, and in line with their policy of housing equipment in their own property, ap - plicant has purchased a location and erected an exchange building of . fire proof materials in which has been installed equipment for the purpose of furnishing city subscribers with common battery service. I . A new building has been erected at a cost of $6,200 and new central office equipment is being installed at a cost of $5,600. At - tention is also called to the fact that free interchange of service is given to all subscribers o£ the Exeter and Cordova exchanges. Appli - cant alleges that a new schedule of rates is necessary to properly maintain these properties and pay a fair return on its investment. In support of its application, the company offered in evidence the testimony of its witnesses and the following statement intended to show future profits on the basis of its proposed rate schedule : </seg>

None of these particular items, seem subject to serious challenge. Inquiry from -witnesses for applicant, including the general man - ager, chief auditor and chief engineer, with respect to valuation, main - tenance and expenditures, developed that the property had been pur - chased in 1912, and was placed upon their book9 at $25,000. upon in - ventory and appraisal value, with no estimate for accrued depreciation. The book value, as of December 31, 1928, was $46,386 and the new construction would add a value of $25,000, with a displacement of pro - perty of a value of about $14,000, so that upon completion of the - improvements the book value would be approximately $57,000. The Commission, in reviewing the expense items which are based upon the past experience of the applicant, finds that they are sub - stantially correct. In previous investigations the Commission has found that depreciation, computed on a 6% basis of total plant in ser - vice, is in excess of the needs' of applicant, but in some cases it has allowed 2V 2 % on buildings and 6% on other depreciable property,. </seg>
            <seg id="p339">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION . .;■••';&gt;■ which, in many cases, was the equivalent of a composite depreciation on book cost of approximately 5y 2 %. In the present case, a 5%% fig - ure would reduce the depreciation- item $285.99, and increase the net return figure of $137.90, a like amount, making a total of $423.89 for net return. Applicant has submitted two sets of figures to be used in determin - ing the fair value of property. The Commission has before it as a guide, the alleged book cost shown above and figures showing reproduc - tion new less deterioration as found by engineers for applicant, as follows: 1 ■ ' ' January 1, 1929— Reproduction value new (existing plant) ....$68,340.11 Condition per cent i .-... .85 Reproduction value new less deterioration :. 1 58,962.88 Improvements being made — ■ Reproduction value new removals $21,374.10 Condition per cent J .86 Reproduction value new less deterioration, removals 18,705.57 Additions .'. 27,731.00 Revision after improvements — Reproduction value new $74,697.61 Condition per cent ; ! .89 Reproduction value new less deterioration : 67,988.36 There are included in these figures of reproduction new items of working capital, going concern value, and estimates of cost of improve - ments, based iipon current experienced prices. According to the estimate submitted by applicant using a 6% de - preciation basis, the. return upon book cost would be about 1-4 of 1%, and the return computed upon the figures of reproduction new less depreciation would be only about 1-5 of 1%. . • Using a depreciation figure of 5%%, the return .on book cost would still be less than 1%. In order to bring a 6% return on book cost, the net income would have to be over $3,400. Subscribers present' at the hearing attempted to obtain compari - sons of rates charged in other communities. While such comparisons are not conclusive, it is true that there are many exchanges in Ne - braska, located in towns of the same size and under similar conditions where the rates are comparable, as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p340">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Town Population Business Residence Res. 2 Party Fairmont 975 $3.75 $2.00 $1.75 Dorchester 522 3.75 2.00 1.75 Emerson 850 3.75 2.50 2.00 Howells 904 3.75 2.50 2.00 Pender 992 3.75 ■ 2.50 2.00 There are about 200 rural subscribers and 95% of these expressed their preference in writing, for rural magneto service at $1.75, rather than common battery service at $2.00 per month. The Commission takes into consideration the fact that a rate of $1.75 for metallic farm line service at the present time has been found necessary and justi - fiable in many recent rate investigations. This is the rate which is being collected from farm subscribers of the Friend exchange, which is immediately to the east of Exeter, and also from the farm subscrib - ers of the Fairmont exchange, which is immediately west of Exeter, where the same class of rural service is rendered. The facts and figures submitted by applicant have been carefully reviewed by the engineering and accounting departments and a con - clusion is made by the Commission that the rates proposed by appli - cant are fair, reasonable and necessary. Certainly it is entirely un - necessary, for the purposes of this case, for the Commission to make any finding as to fair value. It is apparent that this schedule of rates will not begin to produce a fair return, even on original or book cost. No possible revision of the company's estimated annual ex^ penses, downward, could bring about a net return which would even approach a fair return upon fair value of the property. The Commis - sion finds that the rates are necessary. ORDER IT.

OPINION AND FINDING MILLER, Commissioner: Applicant herein owns and operates the telephone exchange in the town of- Dorchester, Saline County.! It has made application to this Commission for authority to increase its rates, both in town and on its farm lines. Hearing was held on this application May 23, 1929, in the Amer - ican Legion hall, at Dorchester, however, after due notices had been given to all interested parties. The present basic rates at Dorchester for magneto service are as follows : Net Gross Individual business $3.00 $3.25 Individual residence 1.50 1.75 Farm line 1.50 . 1.75 This exchange has been operated in rented property or quarters on the main street upstairs over business rooms. The Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph Company proposes to have a new fire proof build - ing of its own which was under construction at the time of the hearing and also. to convert its town lines from magneto to common battery service. The new building, and lot upon 1 which it is constructed, cost applicant slightly less than $6,000. Farm line service will be full metallic. </seg>
            <seg id="p342">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT The present book cost of the company's property used and useful . in providing the community of Dorchester, with magneto service as of December 31, 1928, was $49,861.04, The company will invest more moneys into its Dorchester property as per this new building program, in the amount of $9,214.15. It will bring the book cost up to $59,-. 075.19. At the present time the company is serving 430 subscribers at its Dorchester exchange. For the year 1928, the company's gross revenues from this exchange amount to $9,276.15 and its gross expend - itures include depreciation but not interest, amounting to $9,256.24, leaving a net earnings for the year's operations of $19.19. Under the proposed new rate schedules, the company estimates its annual gross revenues will be $10,729.69 as against estimated an - nual expenses of $9,262.55, leaving as its annual return on its invest - ment at Dorchester exchange the sum of $1,467.14. This will 'provide a return on book cost of the properties of less than 2% per cent. Subscribers at Dorchester, have ' expressed willingness of having new and improved service plus a raise in rates, in so far as 80 per cent of the patrons have signed a petition to that effect. There was no protest to the raise at the hearing. Everyone seemed willing as express - ed by the petition previously. There was some discussion relative to expanding the rural- service, to take in, free of charge, the exchanges at Crete and Friend. The petitions read as follows : &lt;r We, the undersigned subscribers of Dorchester, Nebraska, telephone exchange, do hereby petition the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company to change the telephone service in the town of Dorchester from magneto to common battery. It is understood that after this change is made, that the rates per month for ser - vice which we hereby agree to pay, shall be as follows: Business one party ..$3.75 Residence one party 2.00 Residence two party 1.75 Residence ten party 2.00 Business ten party 2.50." "The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company proposes to change the service furnished its Dorchester, Nebraska, subscrib - ers, from magneto to common battery. The telephone company offers the Dorchester rural subscribers this common battery ser - vice at an increase of 50 cents per month over their present rates, or the option of retaining their present magneto service at an increase of 25 cents per month. It is understood that the city subscribers have petitioned the telephone company to furnish them with common battery service. </seg>
            <seg id="p343">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "In view of these proposals, we, the undersigned subscrjDers of the Dorchester, Nebraska, Telephone Exchange, prefer to con - tinue our present magneto service atithe rate herein shown, ($1.75 per month), in lieu of an increase of 50 cents per month over our present rate for common battery service.

It has applied to this Commission for au - thority to increase the rates both in town and in the country and dis - continue its residence four-party service which has been offered to the public. Rates for additional or special service will not be changed. The present and proposed rates are as follows : Present Business one party ;....$3.00 Residence one party 1.50 Residence four party 1.35 Farm ...........: 1.50 Proposed. Business one party $3.75 Residence one party _ :.. 2.00 Residence two party : 1.75 Farm .:........ 1.75 </seg>
            <seg id="p345">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The exchange has been operated as a full metallic, magneto system with '421 subscribers. Applicant has acquired a new location for its central office and constructed a new building. It now proposes to in - stall a. modern common battery switchboard which will serve the town stations. The town property will be reconstructed and new cable added. The farm service will not be affected except as calls from rural stations may be made through the new switchboard, and the number of stations per farm line will be reduced to ten, or less. The - company will continue to offer county service which includes Benedict, Thayer, Waco, York, McCool and Bradshaw for $1.00 per month in addition to the exchange rates and the Gresham exchange service with one additional town for fifty cents. The Gresham exchange was constructed by the York County Tele - phone Company in the year 1903 and was purchased by the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1912. The property was entered on the books of the Lincoln company on the appraisal basis which means that the' cost of reproduction new as of the time of purchase was used as the starting figure, or book value of the property. Since that time separate accounts have been kept for the exchange and new property has been charged to the book value at cost, and plant removed has been deducted at its original cost. The book value of the plant in service as of December 31, 1928, was $40,884.48 and giving effect to the changes in the town plant which involves the erection of new cable, changes in pole lines, etc., and including the new building and switchboard the book figure becomes . $50,356.12 after the property displaced Iby the above reconstruction program has' been deducted. This means that the real estate and building which the company has been occupying will be taken out of the fixed investment at cost and the new central office equipment^ building, station apparatus, etc., will be added to the book figure at the cost to the company. The company, offered an appraisal of the fixed property giving effect to the above changes which shows a reproduction value new in the sum of $62,968.54 and less deterioration in the amount of $53, - 246.24. These figures do not include working capital which applicant has estimated at $5.00 per station or $2,090.00, nor going concern .value which has been appraised at ten per cent of the cost new, or $6,296.85. The cost new figure is based on an actual inventory of all •the property used for service purposes in the exchange, to which cost units as of January 1, 1929, have been applied. Deterioration as used by the applicant was intended to measure the loss in value which could be determined by inspection. On this basis applicant's engineer found the physical property to be in an] 84 per cent condition. This Commission has said that deterioration as used by the applicant does not include all the factors of depreciation such as accrued depreciation, which may not be visible, also inadequacy and obsolescence. When </seg>
            <seg id="p346">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT these factors are considered the Commission will use 75 per cent o£ the estimated cost new, as a measure of all of the depreciation which has taken place in the plant, or the sum of $47,226.41, exclusive of working capital and going concern. Petitioner's estimate of working capital of $5.00 per station does not give consideration to the fact that service charges are payable in advance which provides at least a part of the cash working capi - tal required for operation, but the service revenues will not provide all the working capital necessary to include stores and supplies, ac - counts receivable and the like.' The courts and commissions have held that going concern value is an element to be considered in finding the value for rate-making pur - poses where the physical property is connected in an operating unit, and serving the public. The limitations of this case do not require that the Commission make a finding as to the amount required for working capital, nor fix the value - of the going concern, and these will be disregarded in reaching our conclusions. It follows that we have the book figure of $50,356.12 and the present depreciated value of the fixed property in the sum of $47,226.41 representing the fixed assets in the exchange. The testimony shows that operating revenues have been based on the actual number of stations in service under the proposed rates which include 25 per cent of the revenues derived from toll, the latter is a customary division and applies to all of the company's exchanges. It originates from the statutory provision which fixes the exchange portion of toll revenue at 15 per cent computed on the outgoing calls and 10 per cent from the inbound service. The annual gross revenues will amount to $10,835.28. The expenses were estimated on the average of the actual expenses for the last four years and amount to $9,046.31, which applicant es - timates will leave a net available for dividends and surplus in the amount of $1,788.97. In the above expenses applicant has included $2,763.92 for depreciation which is approximately 5% per cent com - puted on the book cost of the property giving effect to the proposed changes as described in the testimony. The Commission has found that this is reasonably required for the protection of the property. ■ It appears that net earnings in the amount of $1,788 under the proposed rates will pay a return of 3.7 per cent on;the appraisal figure, less depreciation, and 3.6 per cent on the book figure, giving effect to the additions and betterments and excluding working capital and go - ing concern. Certainly this is not an unreasonable rate of return for the use of the property. The company solicited the subscribers for the purpose of securing their consent to the proposed increase in rates and protestants tes- </seg>
            <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION tified that there was a misunderstanding as to the new rates ana as to whether the rates would be raised regardless of the approval of the patrons. Such failures to understand each other on the part of the company and the subscribers are unfortunate as they cause irrita - tion and destroy cooperation, but the company did not introduce any signed petitions in evidence to show the approval of the subscribers, therefore, the case will be decided on its merits, independently of the controversy. The Commission believes and so finds that the proposed schedule of rates is reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation.

T. Wilson Bus Line, filed formal objection to the granting of order requested for the following reasons: First. That there being sufficient j service now rendered over - the lines applied for; that public convenience and necessity does not demand or require any additional bus service over the lines, or over the routes and 'schedules herein applied for. Second. That this is not a bonafide attempt to render bus ser - vice, but is in fact, an attempt to render auxiliary rail ser - vice and supplementary service thereto. Third. That the granting of such an application and the issn - ance of an order allowing and approving such schedules,. </seg>
            <seg id="p350">342 . TWENTY- SECOND ANNUAL REPORT would be contrary to and in contravention of Chapter 150, of the Session Laws of 1927, state of Nebraska. Fourth. That the granting of an order approving the schedules, routes and establishment of bus routes as requested in the - application, would be in violation of the constitutional rights of the objectors and in contravention of the constitution of the state of Nebraska and of the constitution of the United States of America, more particularly the 5th and 14th a - mendments thereto. . Fifth. For the further objection that the public would not be best served by such schedules, for the reason that con - nections, transfers, depots, are not contemplated to be estab - lished- in the business sections of such villages and cities, as the routes will traverse. Sixth. For the reason that such operation is c'onfiscatory, in violation of the rights of the operators,, motor transportation companies in Nebraska now established, rendering service to the people of the state of Nebraska, for the reason that said operators ' pioneered their operations over dirt roads and before said roads were improved with hard surfaces; that the schedule applied for contemplates the operation exclusively over graveled and hard surfaced roads, com - pleted and finished since the beginning of the pioneer opera - tions of the objectors herein. Seventh. For the further fact that the schedule applied for particularly between Lincoln and Hastings' and between Hastings and Grand Island, and between Grand Island and Lincoln is only a one way trip; therefore the public con - venience and necessity cannot be promoted or enhanced or served by such operation. Eighth. For the further, reason that, considering the opening statement of counsel for the applicant, that such application contemplates merely supplementary service to the said road, whereas the said Burlington railroad has no line between Hastings and Grand Island ; that the application to operate between Hastings and Grand Island is clearly an attempt to operate upon the highways of the state of Nebraska, in a manner. -tlfet is not supplementary of such rail operation. Ninth. For the reason that the operation now contemplated ex - pects to employ the use. of busses painted and decorated almost identical in form and manner, with those now used by the Interstate Transit Lines in its operations between Omaha, Lincoln and Grand Island, and whereas the public safety and control of said operation would be endangered, interfered with, by reason of such painting, design and dec - oration; for the further reason that it would be difficult to distinguish the' busses of the applicant from the busses of the </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ■ ' 1 Interstate Transit Lines, the objector respectfully requests that such distinguishing colors or designs, if such applica - tion is granted, be required o£ the applicant in order that the operation may be properly identified at all times, both, to the public, to the Commission and to the operators, for the promotion of public safety and convenience. Attorney Hardenbrook, representing Pop Corn Trail Sfage Line, adopted the above protest on behalf of his client as did also Attorney Matson, representing the Prairie Stages. Attorney Mat son also ob - jected particularly respecting certain schedules proposed, viz., the 3:15 p. m. schedule out, of Lincoln for Omaha and the 4:00 p. m. schedule out of Lincoln for Hastings, in that they conflicted closely with service now furnished by the Prairie Stages between these same points. No testimony, was presented by protestants, the protesting bus lines above represented by counsel operate a large percentage of bus mileage now rendered daily in Nebraska. Consideration will be given to objections which are offered. In. the main, they raise the question of the power of the Commission to deny the right of applicant to operate, through the medium of refusing to grant a certificate of convenience and necessity. This is not a new question before the Commission. It has been presented formally and informally, on a number of occasions and in each instance not less - than a majority of the Commission have held that the Commission's power to regulate carries no inherent power to prohibit. In Applica - tion No. 6770, Supplement Five, (June 26, j 1928) in the matter of the application of the S. Y. A. Bus Line, a motor transportation company, for authority to extend operations to include service between York r Nebraska and Belleville, Kansas, the Commission, Commissioner Miller dissenting, found that .adequate and efficient bus service was being given by those occupying the field; that additional busses were entirely unnecessary to adequately serve the territory traversed, and that .their operations would probably result in a distinct loss to all; that " ... in the cause of justice and in the interest of general motor transportation service in Nebraska, the Commission feels, that the S. Y. A. Bus Line, applicant herein, should be denied the privilege of establishing the proposed extension of operations to include motor transportation service between York and the Kansas border. BUT, the Commission is of the further opinion, that under the present laws of Nebraska, it is vested with no power to issue to motor transportation companies, certificates of convenience and necessity, and does not, under its especially delegated power to - "regulate the service and safety of operation of each motor trans - portation company in this state" (see Section 2, Chapter 150, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1927), possess a prerogative which will permit its denial or approval of the extension of operations </seg>
            <seg id="p352">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT as proposed in the application herein of the S. Y. A. Bus Line." (21 N. S. R. C. Reports, 197-202.) The Commission receives such jurisdiction as it possesses over the subject matter from two sources.' First, a constitutional grant of plenary power which provides that "... The powers and duties of such Commission shall in - clude the regulation of rates, service and general control of com - mon carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in the provision." (Section 20, Art. IV, Constitution of the State of Nebraska). Second, legislative enactment which defines motor transportation common carriers and provides that " The Nebraska State Railway Commission shall have general control of the common carriers mentioned in Section 1 hereof and is hereby vested with authority to make reasonable regula - tions, except the fixing of rates or fares to be charged, governing each motor transportation company in this state ; is vested with authority to regulate the service and safety of operation of each such motor transportation company in this state; to require said common carriers to file annual and other reports, containing such information and data as the Commission may require, and to provide uniform accounting systems." (Session Laws of Ne - braska, 1927, Chap. 150, Sec. 2. PP404). The Commission cannot agree with protestants that the right to exercise "general control" and the authority to make " reasonable re - gulations" implies authority to grant or ■withhold issuance of certifi - cates of convenience and necessity, permitting or denying the right to operate in the absence of specific legislation. The Commission does not believe that "general control" and "reasonable regulations" are terms synonymous with " prohibition" ; it does not believe there is any im - plied authority to "prohibit" through the medium of a delegated au - thority to "regulate." For these reasons, the Commission gives no con - sideration herein to adequacy or efficiency of service now rendered; it finds that it has neither authority to determine as to the public need for additional service nor the legal right to grant or deny certificates of convenience and necessity based upon any findings as to public necessity. Accordingly, it dismisses from further consideration those objections which go to that question. Referring to objection numbered "Third," the Commission is un - able to find that the granting of the request is in violation of the intent of Chapter 150, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1927, mentioned above, provided applicant complies with rules and regulations adopted by this Commission respecting operation of motor transportation com - mon carriers. This they have done. </seg>
            <seg id="p353">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ■ ... ■ - j Referring to objection numbered "Fourth" and "Sixth," respect - ing confiscation of property, and violation 1 of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America, the Commission cannot agree with the position of protestants relative to the protection afforded under these sections. It is not thought that they contemplated the prevention of -what may be ruinous competition. While it. is true that applicant pioneered the territory served in days when road conditions were much less favorable and opportunities for a fair return much less probable, the Commission does not believe that the sections above referred to carry any guaranty, for these reasons or others, of exclusive privilege to serve. '; Applicants do not have a vested right to use the public highway for the operation of common carrier bus lines to the exclusion of all others. The Commission finds that there is merit in objection numbered "Ninth" which complains of the use by applicant of a color scheme almost identical with the color scheme of busses now operated by protestants. On the routes traversed busses will be running with great .frequency and the color of the bus will probably make more of an impression on the public mind in identifying operations than any other one thing. ' A satisfied or dissatisfied patron will probably remember service rendered more particularly by the color o:' the bus in which he rode than by the name of the operating company. Furthermore, in ease of accident or discourteous treatment to users oi! public highways, or in violation of the laws of the state respecting use of our highway system, the color of the bus is the outstanding means of identifying the vehicle. Applicant expressed a willingness to 'adopt a color scheme which, in so far as possible, will avoid conflict -with the color scheme of other busses plying the highways. The Commission will provide for this in its order. Respecting specific objections of Attorney Matson on behalf of the Prairie Stage Lines, relative to certain conflicts in schedule the Commission finds that, on its own motion] Prairie Stage Lines afford no local service between Lincoln and Omaha on (their bus leaving at 3:10 P. M., there being no local stops made by the Prairie Stage bus between Lincoln and Omaha. The margin' of time between their oper - . ations on the highway becomes greater the moment they depart. from Lincoln, in that Prairie Stage bus makes no stops. Respecting the conflict in schedules on the Hastings route, applicant's bus departs from Lincoln at 4:00 p. m. via Milford. The bus of Prairie Stage Lines departs from Lincoln at 4 :30 via Crete. At the stations of Dorchester, Friend and Exeter the arrival and departure time provides for but a ten minutes spread, otherwise there is no iviolent conflict between the schedules. Applicant states that its departure time out of Lincoln is important in that it makes connection with Burlington trains No. 40 arriving in Lincoln at 3 :50 p. m. from Ravenna; also train No. 90 arriv - ing in Lincoln at 3:55 p. m. from Wymore. </seg>
            <seg id="p354">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT The Commission will authorize the .schedule as proposed but will give the matter further consideration if- this conflict in schedule occas - ions confusion or difficulty. ■ • Applicant was recently incorporated under- the laws of the state of Illinois with a capitalization of $500,000, $250,000 of which is now paid in. This stock is owned by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company. It contemplates doing common carrier bus business in the states of Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois. It has ordered ten busses, general motors products', commonly known as yellow coaches. These busses are equipped with the latest safety devices and will seat twenty-two passengers. The plan of operation contemplates a development of so called, hub-service, with, stops to be made in each city or town at the Burlington depot. At the present time the service in Nebraska is to be largely supplementary to Burling - ton passenger service. A review of schedules proposed indicates that, with the exception of conflict at Dorchester, Friend and Exeter, the spread between ser - vice is as great as can be. made having in mind frequency of service on the routes traversed. Applicant has complied with Commission rules and regulations respecting operations in Nebraska. The Commission will authorize schedules as proposed, but will re - open the case if subsequent developments indicate undue confusion, misunderstanding or difficulty as a result of near conflict of schedules at the points above referred to. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Burlington Transportation Company, effective immediately, be and the same is hereby authorized to operate its busses on the routes and schedules as set forth in the opinion and finding herein. » ■ ■ IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within a period of not less than thirty days from date applicant shall have adopted, after Commission approval, a color scheme for its busses, such color scheme to avoid in so far as possible conflict with the color scheme of busses now plying the public highways of Nebraska. • ■ • Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this ninth day of April, 1929.

            <seg id="p356">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION NO. 7753 This is the application of J. Davis, superintendent of the Missouri Paci - fic Railroad Company for authority to substitute motor car service for steam train service on- the Concordia-Prosser line between Prosser and Superior) Nebraska. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner : ■ - ■ The Missouri Pacific Railroad Company some time previous to making this application to substitute motor car service for steam train service, on their Prosser line between Prosser and Superior, had made such substitution without making an application to the Nebraska State Railway Commission, the company being under the impression that as this service was an interstate service between Prosser, Nebraska and Concordia, Kansas, that it was only necessary for them to obtain permission from the Kansas Commission to make such substitution. The Nebraska State Railway Commission had no knowledge of this change in service until recently and upon investigation found that the company had made such substitution without first obtaining per - mission from the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The attention of the company was called to this irregular proceeding and the company was informed by the Commission that if they desired to continue run - ning this class of service on this line, that it would be necessary for them to obtain permission after making an application showing that motor car service of the kind substituted was of sufficient size and capacity to take caTe of all passenger, express and baggage business on that line. Accordingly on the 24th day of April, 1929, Mr. J. Davis, superintendent made the application in the following words, to ■wit : "Owing to the decreased passenger business brought about thru the medium of privately ownffl automobiles used for trans - portation purposes, as well as busses, we would like permission to substitute gasoline motor car on trains No. 641 and No. 642 operating between Concordia and Prosser. Motor Car will be of sufficient size and capacity to take care of all passenger business as well as baggage, etc., and this sub - stitution will in no way effect the. service to the public and during the test period while it has been in operatiqn there have been no complaints from the patrons or any dissatisfaction on the part of the various cities and villages thru which same operates, and if consistent would like to have formal approval of the Commis - sion to continue motor car on this particular branch of the Mis - souri Pacific." </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY 'COMMISSION It appears to the Nebraska State Railway Commission that as this service has already been substituted and been in operation for some time, no complaints having been received from the patrons as to the ser - vice, that the motor furnished by tlje company is giving as adequate service as the steam train that had previously operated on this line, and at quite a saving of overhead expense to the company and that the com - pany should be permitted to continue to operate this motor unless written complaint of the inadequacy of the service is filed with the Com - mission. In that case, hearing will be held and the company required to furnish service that will take care of the business on this line. ■ ■' I In case written complaint is not filed within ninety days from the date o£ this order, this order will become permanent and the com - pany be permitted to operate this gas motor! car in lieu of steam trains Nos. 641 and 642, between Prosser and Superior, Nebraska. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company be permitted to substitute motor car service on its line between Prosser and Super - ior, Nebraska, for a ninety-day trial period,' subject to objections that may be filed by the patrons along that line, and if objections are en - tered as to the service being inadequate the Commission will give the objectors an opportunity to be heard and make proper finding after the investigation has been made. If there! are no objections to this class of service filed during the ninety-day trial period, the order will automatically become permanent.

It has an authorized capital stock in the amount of $200,000 per value divided into 10,000 BhaTes of common and 10,000 shares of preferred stock, all of the par value of $10 each. Petitioner has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell 5,500 shares of its common capital stock and 500 shares of its 7% preferred stock at face value. The articles of incorporation provide that applicant will be engaged in the transportation of commodities by means of motor vehicles in Nebraska and nearby states. The business is already a going concern which began in a small way through the efforts of H. F. Anderson and W. A. Jefferys, the original incorporators,- who propose to sell all of their assets, subject to the liabilities of the business to the new corporation. Mr. Anderson 'operated from Omaha by way o£ Blair and Fremont, north to South Sioux City, Nebraska. Mr. Jefferys operated out of Grand Island between towns along the Union Pacific to Omaha. The business of the new company will extend west from Omaha by way of Lincoln to points as far west as Broken Bow anc the route between Omaha and Grand Island will be extended to North Platte, and north from Omaha to South Sioux City, Nebraska ant Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and supply "service to approximately sevent] towns in Nebraska and nearby states. The new company will own al of the equipment and transportation facilities of original incorporators which have been devoted to the business, this includes terminal facili - ties in Grand Island and Omaha, also at Ravenna. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAYi COMMISSION Petitioner submitted a detailed statement showing the depreciated cost of the trucks and conveyances used in the business at a value of $44,873. The physical condition of this property was determined by inspection. A careful dependable record of ! the mileage on the vehicles was not available, but an estimate was used, 1 based on the best informa - tion at hand. The average depreciation on the trucks falls below three cents per mile, which appears to be the experience of motor, busses used for the transportation of persons. The business is new and de - pendable depreciation data has not been collected. However, the Com - mission believes that the depreciation determined by inspection does not include all of the factors necessary to determine the loss in the value of the property. The testimony shows that applicant has expended the equivalent of a substantial sum, in money and labor and time, in developing the business. It also shows that applicant hasileased terminals in Omaha and' Grand Island, on which it has expended funds for loading plat - forms and facilities suitable for handling freight. These leases expire in the near future; however, applicant may recover some salvage in the event that they are not renewed. In consideration of these facts the Commission will use $45,000 as the present value of the trucks which will include the actual expense of developing the business and such salvage as there may be in the terminal facilities under lease. I : Petitioner now owns real estate in Ravenna which is being devel - oped for purposes suitable to the business. The present value of the grounds and money expended to date is approximately $3,200. Four thousand dollars additional will be required to complete the building now in process of construction. A statement of proposed assets also includes office furniture and fixtures and miscellaneous equipment in the amount of $5,630 and accounts receivable in the sum of $3,528. Summarizing the existing property we have the following: Trucks and Utility equipment . . $45,000.00 Real Estate 3,200.00 Office Furniture and Fixtures 5,630.00 Accounts receivable 3,528.00 Total $57,358.00 . • ' ■ ' ■ ' • V . ■' Among the proposed expenditures we find $8,750 for tractor truck and semi-trailer, $4,000 will be required to complete the store house in Ravenna, $500 for new refrigerator equipment at Grand Island and $500 for attorneys fees and : incorporation expenses. These items amounting to $13,750 are in process of expenditure and construction, making a total amount subject to indebtedness in the sum of $71,100. </seg>
            <seg id="p360">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Applicant owes accounts and notes payable in the sum of $19,437 which results in net assets in the sum of approximately $52,000, in - cluding additions and betterments as described above. Applicant may retire the outstanding indebtedness from earnings, although no specific items were described in the testimony. Indebtedness created for plant or equipment is subject to capitalization when paid from earnings.- However, it is probable that the total amount of indebtedness may not be reduced as new equipment will be purchased as the business expands. Applicants present system of accounts is insufficient to determine what the annual earnings or expenses have been. The record shows, however, that the present net assets have come about through the earning: power of the property in the last few years and when proper records of revenues and expenses are kept, the net earnings should be sufficient to pay a return on the stock applicant proposes to issue and sell. ■ The Commission believes and so finds, that the issue and sale of 5,200 shares of capital stock of applicant is reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation, to pay for the property acquired and additions and betterments described in the testimony. The Commission will also authorize the issue of 800 shares of preferred stock to be held in the treasury of the company, to pay for additions and betterments that will be required in the near future for the expansion of the business. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Nebraska Motor Transportation Company of Grand Island, be and the same is hereby permitted to issue and sell 5,000 shares of its common capital -stock of the par value of $10 each, and 200 shares of its 7% preferred stock, to net the applicant riot less than face value. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the proceeds of the sale of the above stock shall be" used to pay for the property acquired by the corporation and described in the application, also additions and better - ments in the amount of $13,750 as described in the. testimony. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant may issue 800 shares of its 7% preferred stock and hold the same in the treasury to be issued and sold at not less than par, to pay for additions and better - ments as they may be required in the business. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall report to the Commission the proceeds received from the sale of the 800 shares of preferred stock held in its treasury and the purpose, for which the funds were expended. </seg>
            <seg id="p361">. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall charge operating expenses annually on a monthly basis and credit its depreciation reserve with three cents per mile, computed on the total number of truck miles and the same shall be used to pay the cost of plant and equipment retired from service. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall keep a complete set of accounts which shall show all assets and liabilities, operating revenues and expenses,, additions and betterments and credits and debits to its depreciation reserve.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The applicant herein is a Maryland corporation, incorporated on the 20th day of April, 1929, for the purpose of engaging in the operat - ing of electric light, power, ice, gas and water works. Applicant cor - poration was formed for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of the Nebraska Electric Power Company, a corporation incorporated under the laws of Delaware and owning arid operating utility properties </seg>
            <seg id="p362">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT in about fifty towns in Nebraska, and for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of the Northern Division of- the Western Public Service Company, a Colorado corporation, which owns public utility properties in Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, the stock and bonds of the Missouri Service Company, a Missouri corporation, and which formerly owned a large group of properties in the state of Texas. Both the Nebraska Electric Power Company and the Western Public Service Company, Colorado, have previously been applicants before this Com - mission for the issuance of securities and all of the outstanding securities of both the companies have been previously approved by this Commission, Nebraska Electric Power Company under Applications Nos. 5818 and 6414 and Western Public Service Company, Colorado, under Application No. 5346. Western Public Service Company, Colorado, at the time of previous financing served about eighty-one communities in Texas, Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, more than half of which properties were located in the state of Texas. On March 30, 1925, (18 N. S. R. C. Reports, 236-242) this Commission approved the issuance by Western Public Service Company, Colorado, of $4,200,000 6% twenty-five year bonds; $1,000,000 6y 2 % debenture gold bonds and $5,000,000 face amount of 7% preferred stock. At that time Western Public Service Company, Colorado, was owned and operated by private individuals. Subsequently thereto, in August 1925, Eastern Texas Electric Company, a Delaware corporation, acquired a majority, and later all of the common voting stock of Western Public Service Company, Colorado, and nt that time divided Western Public Service Company, Colorado, for operating purposes, into a Southern Division comprising all of the properties in Texas and a Northern Division, consisting of the pro. - perties in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. Since that time, except for consolidated balance sheets, the two divisions have been operated as two entirely separate units. At the time of approval of previous financing this Commission, owing to the distance, quantities of property and expense involved, made no physical examinations or appraisement of the properties in Texas but utilized appraisals supplied by applicant and made by disinterested engineers. The books of the company were set up on the values as shown by the above appraisals which were made a part of the record. Since that time and recently, Western Public Service Company, Colorado, has sold all of its properties in Texas to Gulf States Utilities Company, a separate corporation, for the amount of $5,870,000 in cash, which it has received and this cash price is sub - stantially in excess of the valuation put upon such property by this Commission in its previous order, thereby indicating that the previous valuations were, if anything, lower than the fair market value of the properties. In 1927, Eastern Texas Electric Company, Delaware, also acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Nebraska Electric Power </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Company, which owned and operated about 35 utility properties in Nebraska. Since that time, Nebraska Electric Power Company and the Northern Division of Western Public Service Company have been oper - ating under identical management with the same manager, accounting department, superintendents, etc., and for all practical purposes have been one corporation. The Commission finds that on March, 1929, Eastern Texas Electric Company, Delaware, advanced ' to Western Public Service Company, Colorado, sufficient money to call and retire all of the outstanding bonded indebtedness of Western Public Service Company, Colorado. Likewise, Eastern Texas Electric Company has advanced to Western Public Service Company, Colorado, sufficient money to redeem and retire all outstanding preferred stock of Western Public Service Company, Colorado, as of June X 1929. Therefore, at this time, Western Public Service Company, Colorado, has no outstanding bonds) no outstanding preferred stock, ancl only one stockholder (other than directors qualifying shares) and that stockholder is Eastern Texas Electric Company, Delaware, which is likewise the sole creditor (aside .from current bills), and which has for these purpose's advanced to Western Public Service Company, Colorado, in excess of $4,000,000. Eastern Texas Electric Company, Delaware, is likewise the sole stockholder of both preferred and common stock of Nebraska Electric Power Company. Nebraska Electric Power Company ias outstanding $669,500 5% first mortgage bonds, which it is proposed to permit to remain as ' underlying securities. Likewise, Nebraska Electric Power Company has guaranteed mun - icipal bonds in the following amounts: Village of Gordon, 5% bonds $63,500.00 Village of Merna, 6% bonds 10,000.00 Village of Ogallala, 5% bonds 10,000.00 which will remain as underlying obligations. Aside from these under - lying obligations therefor, Eastern Texas Electric Company, Delaware, is the sole stockholder and the sole creditor of both the old companies here involved (aside from current bills). ! - In order to consolidate the two corporations heretofore mentioned and to unify their operations under one name and to unify, their accounting into one set of books, together with the attendant benefits derived therefrom, applicant corporation, the Western Public Service Company of Maryland, was formed April 20, 1929, and sub - sequently thereto has sold all of its preferred stock in the amount of 40,000 shares to Eastern Texas Electric Company of Delaware for $920,000 in cash, which it has received and has sold all of its common stock consisting of 300,000 shares to Eastern Texas Electric Company for $3,223,000 in cash, which it has received. </seg>
            <seg id="p364">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Subsequently thereto, the Western Public Service Company, Mary - land, has entered into contracts of purchase and has purchased all of the physical assets, plants, transmission lines, generating sta - tions, franchises and other assets of Western Public Service Company, Colorado, for $1,550,000 cash, and the assumption of all liabilities as of the close of business May 31, 1029, and all of the physical property, franchises and other assets o£ Nebraska Electric Power Company, for $440,000, cash, and the assumption of all liabilities as of the close of business May 31, 1929, and applicant company is therefore the present owner of all of the properties of the preceding companies as of June 1, 1929. Applicant has been legally admitted to do business in the state of Nebraska, and as of June 1, 1929, title to all the properties of Western Public Service Company, Colorado, and Nebraska Electric Power Company in Nebraska, will become vested in applicant corpora - tion. Applicant likewise has, as a part of the purchase price of the properties which it has acquired, assumed the obligation of both Western Public Service Company, Colorado, and Nebraska Electric Power Company to Eastern Texas Electric Company (Delaware) for money advanced by it to them for the puruoses hereinafter set forth. This amount at the present time is in excess of $4,000,000. Applicant is therefore in the position of .having acquired utility properties in approximately one hundred towns in Colorado, Wyoming:, Nebraska ; of having: sold all of its outstanding; common stock, to-wit : 300,000 shares for $3,223,000, cash, without discount; of having sold, all of its preferred stock to-wit: 40,000 shares, for $920,000, cash, and of having 1 (aside from guaranteed bonds current liabilities) only one creditor, namely, Eastern Texas Electric Company of Delaware. Applicant began this application as an anplication authorizing it to market $4,000,000 30-year, 5% first mortgage bonds and on that basis the Commission, through its accounting department and I. J. DeVoc, its chief accountant, has. made a rather extensive examination of the company's books, accounts, records and methods. Because of the present unsatisfactory conditions of the bond market, applicant has changed its application to seek authority to issue $4,000,000 face amount 6 1-4%, three-year notes for the. purpose of funding into a definite form a portion of its current obligations to Eastern Texas Electric Company, of Delaware. Part of this obligation which applicant assumes from Western Public Service Company, Colorado, has been represented by demand notes owing by Western Public Service Company, Colorado, to Eastern Texas Electric Company. On. these notes Western Public Service Company has been paying the rate of 6% per annum. The remainder •was advanced by Eastern Texas Electric Company, Delaware, to Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ■■■'■'■'■• ■ ' ■ •• braska Electric Power Company and on this amount Nebraska Electric Power Company previously paid to Eastern Texas Electric Company 8% per annum. It is apparent from the standpoint of interest charges ■ that the renewal, of the obligation in a definite form at 6 1-4% is more advantageous to applicant company than the current and agreed in - terest rates on the demand note which it has assumed, and in the absence of some sound reason should apparently receive the approval of this Commission. While applicant is a new corporation, it is, of course, in fact a reorganization of exisiting corporations and Com - mission may therefore discuss some of the changes which have been made since previous orders were entered. I ■ ■".■■■'■ ' ' At the time of the previous order relating to Western Public Service Company, that is, on March 30, 1925, supra, Commission severely criticized a re-appraisal of corporate property which was had and which resulted in a surplus due to appreciation through this ap - praisement in excess of $1,000,000, which was represented by a surplus item carried in the balance sheet !of the company. The Com- ' mission is glad to know that this item has been entirely written off from the books of the company. The Commission has made extensive examination of the books and accounts of the new management of Western Public Service Company, Colorado, upon which the present corporation set up is based. There is much in the recent accounting and management which deserves the approval of this Commission. The revaluation surplus previously occurring has been eliminated. For the first time under the present management the company has been, setting up depreciation reserve out of earned operating income. The company 1 has coordinated its physical properties to the point where it has been able to effect operating" economies making these things possible,' and has reduced its rates to consumers accordingly. The company [has done a large amount of new construction and has purchased many additional properties under its present management in the last three years and in no case has it .attempted to write up the valuations of any such properties, nor has it added any intangible elements of value thereto such as super - vision and overhead charges so that the plant account of the company from the date of previous financing represents almost exactly the actual cash expenditures for the properties acquired or the construc - tion built. This verv conservative policy has materially, therefore, improved the rather large intangible items that previously found their way into the plant account and the fact that the Southern Division of Western Public Service Company, Colorado, has been sold at a cash price in advance of the amount at which 1 it- was carried on the com - pany's books, is the best evidence that there are no inflated valuations on the company's books with relation to the properties which it holds. We therefore believe and so find, that it is to the best interest of this applicant, that it definitely fund its I obligations into the form of </seg>
            <seg id="p366">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT notes for a period of time that will enable it to carry on without having to resort to bonds until the conditions are perhaps more favorable, and especially in view of the fact that it apparently has the privilege of redeeming this note issue at any time the bond market becomes more favorable. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Western Public Service Company be and it is hereby authorized to issue and sell its 6 1-4% three-year unsecured promissory notes in the principal amount of $4,000,000, without dis - count, bearing date of June 1, 1929, and that it apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of its obligations to Eastern Texas Electric Company, Delaware, which has advanced the necessary cash to bring about the transaction set forth in the application. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as of June 1, 1929, that for each successive month thereafter for a period of twelve months, the comnany shall file with this Commission a statement of the sale of securities sold under this order and the use of the proceeds, each statement to cover the preceding thirty days; (b) Consolidated bal - ance sheet together with such explanations as may be necessary to explain any changes made therein, other than as the result of normal operations. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall charge income, or surplus, according to its accounting practices, with an amount which shall be equal on an annual average basis to 2% computed on the cost of the depreciable property, and credit its depreciation re - serve accordingly to pay the cost of plant retired from service.

            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION APPLICATION NO. 7797 In the matter of the application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, for authority to establish common battery service at its O'Neill exchange, and to provide a rate schedule therefor. OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman. This action arises on application of the Northwestern Bell Tele - ■ phone Company, for authority to provide common battery service to the town subscribers of its O'Neill exchange, and, upon readiness to furnish common battery service, to establish a revised schedule of rates. Accompanying application aie petitions signed by subscribers, reading as follows : "To the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company: We, the undersigned subscribers for telephone service for the O'Neill, Nebraska, exchange, {hereby request that the ex - change be converted from magneto to a common battery system. Beginning with the date on which we are furnished with common ; . battery service we agree to pay the following rates; Per Month Net Business 1-Party Service i $4.00 Business 2-Party Service 1 3.50 Residence 1-Party Service | 2.50 Residence 2-Party Service 1 2.00 Residence 4-party Service 1 1.75" ■ Out of a total of 351 town subscribers of the O'Neill exchange as 'of April 30, 1929, 312 of the subscribers have signed the above petition, representing 316 main line city telephones or approximately 90% of the total number of telephone users. Of the remaining 35 subscribers ■whose names are not attached to the petition, only 17 actually refused to sign, and a number of these indicated no objection, on their part, to the changed service under the proposed rates. It is unusual to find such a unanimity of opinion among telephone subscribers for improved service at increased rates. Haying in mind this unanimity of opinion which exists among affected subscribers, it seems unnecessary to. hold formal heating at O'Neill respecting the subject matter. Never - theless, the Commission is. still charged with the responsibility of deter - mining whether' the schedule of rates proposed is reasonable and whether the improved service should be authorized. The service is now magneto, sometimes referred to as the "hand - crank" system. For a city the size of O'Neill, it is perhaps fair to say that this is not now regarded as modern up-to-date service, as </seg>
            <seg id="p368">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT so prompt service can not be furnished as under the common battery system herein proposed. Without question, common battery service will provide a speedier and more satisfactory service. The company, in the immediate future, will be confronted with a reconstruction pro - gram. Such a program should properly contemplate the telephone requirements of this community for years in advance. The problem is as to whether applicant should plan its construction program on a basis of magneto for a further period Qf years, or whether the con - clusion should be reached that the higher grade service is now. proper for this community. O'Neill is a city of (slightly less than twenty-five hundred population. It serves a prosperous trade territory and the city itself is a trrowing, thriving city. There are but few cities in Nebraska, the size of O'Neill which do not now enjoy the higher grade common battery service. Having in mind the almost unanimously evcressed desire on the part of the citizens for the common battery service, and having in mind the desire of applicant'to proceed forthwith in what involves a rather large investment in the furnishing of common battery service, the conclusion is reached that the Commission should not deny the furnishing 1 of common battery service. The question still remains as to whether the following schedule of rates, proposed by applicant, are reasonable rates: WITHIN THE BASE RATE AREA: Gross Business individual : .....$4.25 (a) Business two party : 3.75 (a) Residence individual , . 2.75 (a) Residence two party :.... 2.25 (a) Residence four party 2.00 (a) WITHOUT THE BASE RATE AREA: Rural Residence — grounded - 2.00 (a) Rural service station (annual rate) L......... 6.25. (b) (a) A discount of 25c is allowed from this rate each month in which the subscriber's entire account, including any balance due, is paid on or before the 15th of that month. (b) Payable annually in advance. A discount of $1.-00 is allowed, from this annual charge if paid within the first two months of the twelve months for which the bill is rendered. I I Data submitted by applicant shows' that book cost of its pro - perties, including lands and buildings but exclusive of properties de - voted to toll other than lands and buildings, will be increased from approximately $29,000 to approximately $52,000. Applicant estimates gross additions to property totaling approximately $60,000, and gross removals of approximately $22,000, leaving estimated net additions, after conversion to common battery, of approximately $38,000. In </seg>
            <seg id="p369">; NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION other words, of the total investment, or book cost, of approximately $52,000, in excess of 7.0% will be new properties placed as a result of the change in service. Consequently, jas respects this 70% of the property, investment or book cost and reproduction new would be one and. the same figure, at this moment. The Commission concludes that • for the purposes of this case, $52,000 might well represent the fair value of the properties, upon which applicant is entitled to earn. This figure, of course, includes nothing for working capital or going concern value, which undoubtedly would have to be given consideration by the Commission, if applicant insisted upon their being included. Applicant sets forth total annual telephone revenues, exclusive of toll, in amount of $13,676.44. It also. sets, forth total telephone operating expenses, in amount of $10,297.10, leaving an amount available for interest, dividends and surplus, in amount of $3,379.34. If this 'entire amount were to be applied as a far ■ return upon the fair value of $52,000, used by the Commission for the purposes of this case, it would result in a return of slightly more than 6%. This does not appear to be unreasonable, particularly, when consideration is given to the- fact that certain intangibles which, under jholdings of the court, must be considered in determining fair value, haVe not been given con - sideration in the $52,000 figure. In connection with the conversion of this exchange to common battery, applicant contemplates the purchasing if a lot and the con - struction of a building, that permanent quarters may be provided, and that its offices may be more accessible to the public, more modern as respects working conditions, with adequate provision being made for future growth. The construction of this modern fireproof building will be a real contribution to the architecture of the city. Applicant estimates that the lot and building will! cost in the neighborhood of $15,000. Applicant also contemplates the replacement of certain worn out inadequate outside plant and the elimination of certain unsatis - factory and hazardous conditions, due to inadequate separations of the telephone plant from the electric light wires, by establishing joint • construction with the power company. iFurthennore, it has been re - quested to remove its feeder cable and associated pole line from one of the main "business streets of the town. In order to avoid making overhead crossings over two streets in the main business section, it is planned to place two blocks of main underground conduits, together with associated underground cable, in place of aerial construction. The conversion will, of course, involve the entire replacement of all central office telephone equipment atj the O'Neill exchange and all of the magneto substation equipment, as well. Data furnished by applicant indicates that the cost of the new switchboard, plus new subscriber station apparatus, will be approximately $25,000. Applicant, in its land and buildings figure, has made no allowance for the use of same for toll purposes. | However, the exchange has </seg>
            <seg id="p370">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT been given a rent compensation credit, based upon the toll business making approximately 45% use of the land and buildings. Having in mind all of the aforesaid facts, it is the conclusion of the Commission that applicant should be permitted to comply •with the demands made by telephone subscribers of O'Neill, and at the earliest possible moment, place itself in a position to furnish common battery service at this exchange. After careful review of the facts and figures which have been submitted by applicant, it is the Commission's con - clusion that the rate schedule requested is a fair and reasonable one. The schedules proposed involve an increase of only twenty-five cents per subscriber per month, both business and residence. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company be, and the same is hereby authorized and directed to proceed forthwith to make its exchange at O'Neill, with the exception of the rural lines, common battery. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, effective on the first day of such month as applicant is prepared to furnish common battery service at its O'Neill exchange, the Northwestern Bell Telephone Com - pany, be, and the same is hereby authorized to publish and collect th&amp; following schedule of exchange rates for common battery service: WITHIN THE BASE RATE AREA: Gross Business individual :.. :........; .$4.25 (a) Business two party . .' 3.75 (a) Residence individual . 2.75 (a) Residence two party 2.25 (a) Residence four party 2.00 (a) WITHOUT THE BASE RATE AREA: Rural residence — grounded 2.00 (a) Rural service station (annual rate) ;.. 6.25 (b) (a) A discount of 25c is allowed from this rate each month in which the subscriber's entire account, including any balance due, is paid on or before the 15th of that month.

            <seg id="p371">. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION APPLICATION NO. 7803 In the matter of the application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quiney Railroad Company for authority to! change certain of its train schedules. OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: In accordance with the usual custom during the summer months, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quiney Railroad Company has made applica - tion to reinstate interstate trains Nos. 1 and 10, between Chicago and Denver, through Nebraska. The schedules o£ Nos. 1 and 10, as applied for, are very much faster than heretofore, owing to the fact that the company is attempting to meet short-time competition between Denver and Chicago. This has decreased the time between Chicago and Denver on No. 1 two hours and on No. 10 between Denver and Chicago, two and one-half hours. In order to do this it has been necessary to eliminate a number of stops, but the company is furnishing service to the towns where these stops have been eliminated by other trains, so there will be sufficient service furnished: and the elimination of stops of trains Nos. 1 and 10 will not discommode the traveling public. The Burlington Transportation Company has established bus routes between Omaha, and Hastings paralleling these trains, which will pick up local passengers and carry them to points where trains Nos. 1 and 10 stop. From information that we have, which is not of record, however, bus communication will be extended probably as far west as Oxford and McCook, in the very near future. The application gives a complete change in schedules of not only Nos. 1 and 10,- but other trains covering this territory in each direction, which is as follows : "In Nebraska the stop of No. 10 at Oxford is out out; also, with the restoration of this train No. 10, in the past, we have transferred the stop at Minden from No. 6 to No. 10, but this summer we will continue the stop of No. 6 there instead of trans - . f erring it to No. 10.

OPINION AND FINDING MILLER, Commissioner : Applicant herein filed its application for rate increase on June 5, 1929, for the approval of the Commission, which application was set down for hearing, to be held at Hubbell, June 27, 1929. After due notice had been given to all interested parties, hearing was held in the community hall at Hubbell, at 2 o'clock p. m. on June 27, 1929. Following are schedules of present and proposed rates: NET Present Proposed Business— 1 party $1.50 $2.50 Residence — 1 party . 1.25 1.75 Residence— 2 party 1.25 1.50 Farm Res. — 10 party grounded 1.25 1.50 Farm Bus.— 10 party grounded 1.50 2.00 Farm Res. — 10 party metallic 1.75 Farm Bus.— 10 party metallic 2.25 Business extension .75 1.00 Residence extension .50 .50 Added Charge for desk sets .25 .25 Added charge for monophone .50 Added charge for extension bell .25 Added charge for extension loud .50 Vacation rate . .50 Added charge beyond city radius per 1-4 mile .'2"&gt; The company, by. its manager, B. 6. Miller, offered testimony, supported by exhibits, showing that a valuation of the property was made by this Commission in 1925, and further showed that such valua - tion, with additions and betterments, since that time up to April 30, </seg>
            <seg id="p374">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL EEPOET . 1929, was $18,064.98. Applicant further shows that it had purchased this property on January 21st, 1927; that during the period from such date to December 31st, 1927, the gross revenue was in the amount of $3, - 569.12, with a total expense of $3,325.10, leaving 'a net income of $244.02; that during the period of the year 1928, the gross revenue was $4,005.46 and total expense was $3,770.05, leaving a net income of $235.41; that the gross revenue from January 1, 1929 to April 30, 1929, was $1,355.01 and the total expense was $1,359.50, leaving a net loss of $24.49. Applicant shows that under the proposed rate, the expected gross revenues will be in the amount of $4,807.60; that total expense will be $4,543.50, leaving a net income of $264.10, which would be V/o% return on the investment of $18,064.98, as shown by its records. ■• Applicant requests permission to set aside 6% for depreciation, but did not present facts or experiences in this exchange to substanti - ate this amount for a property of this size and type. It has not been the policy of this Commission to permit a telephone company of this class to set aside a separate amount for depreciation, and believes no exception should be made in this case. To expedite accounting in these small exchanges, the Commission has found that the maintenance and depreciation set up should be together. The amount that has been set aside for maintenance and depreci - ation, in this exchange, has, in the past, varied to from 10% to 12% of the depreciable property and the reserve still had a balance of $2,G3;}.GG at the close of the year 1928, with a total fixed investment' of $15,722.47. Most of the property has been rebuilt in the past two years, cable replacing open wire and there have been many other im - provements. The property removed has been properly charged to reserve and yet a substantial balance remains. These have been abnormal years, and such large charges to re - serve are not anticipated in the near future. Past experiences of this company have shown somewhere between 10% and 12% of the depreci - able property has been sufficient, and there is no reason to believe that it is not adequate in the future. The Commission therefore finds that 10% should be set aside for maintenance and depreciation by this applicant at this exchange. Applicant represents that if the proposed rates are authorized, that it will increase the service. The present service provides for central office hours from 6 a. m. to 9 p. in., except Sundays, when the office is closed from noon until 4 p. m. Applicant proposes to extend the service to 10 p. m. and to keep open from noon to 4 p. m. on Sun - days. Emergency service will also be provided at all other times, for emergency calls, and toll service, providing for a 10-cent service charge on all calls outside of regular hours, on all calls not toll or emergency calls. </seg>
            <seg id="p375">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The Commission taking due consideration of the valuation o£ the properties as shown by applicant, and also the estimated net return under the proposed rates, finds that the rate of return therefrom is not unreasonable. The Commission further finds, from the testimony of subscribers, that the hours of central office service is not unrea- - sonable, with the exception that such central office should be kept open at least one hour later on Saturday nights. There were present at the hearing, about 25 subscribers, represent - ing both banks and the larger business houses. The principal objection voiced, seemed to be about the service rendered. There did not seem to be any concrete objection to a rate, that ■would give a reasonable return, but they insisted on better service. | Witnesses stated that some - times they had to ring central three or four times ; that the central office was a loafing station; 'that toll calls were not handled with rea - sonable care or dispatch; that when a subscriber wanted to make a second call immediately after a call, that they could not get central for a long time; that central operators listened in on calls and started "gossip"; and that there "was considerable cross-talk on metallic lines, probably due to defective switchboard. The Commission therefore finds that there is probably grounds for complaint .on service, and that the rates hereinafter authorized will be subject to complaint and dependent upon a correction of all ■ above mentioned complaints.

            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION OPINION AND FINDING MILLER, . Commissioner : Applicant herein filed its application for rate increase June 5, 1929, for the approval of the Commission, and said application was set down for hearing to be held at Reynolds, June 27, 1929. After due notice had been given to all interested parties, hearing was -held in the community hall at Reynolds at 9 o'clock a. in., June 27, 1929. There were about six subscribers of the company, out of a total of one hundred and sixty-five, who attended the I hearing. Following are the present and proposed rate schedules: Present Proposed Business— 1 party $1.25 $2.50 Residence — 1 party 1.25 1.75 Residence^ party 1.25 1.50 Farm Residence— 10 party grounded 1.25 1.50 Farm Business — 10 patty grounded ! 1.25 2.00 Farm Residence — 10 party metallic 1.75 Farm Business — 10 party metallic 2.25 Business extension .75 1.00 Residence extension .50 Add. charge for desk sets .25 Add. charge for monophones .50 Add. charge for ext. bell . .25 Add. charge bell loud .50 Vacation rate ' .50 .50 Additional charge beyond city radius per 1-4 mile .25 Although this is a sharp increase, the Commission knows of no other exchange the size of Reynolds that is, or has been, enjoying such reasonable rates. The balance sheet of the Reynolds Telephone Company shows that they were in the red, December 31, 1928, in the ■ amount of $349.87, and that for the first four months of 1929 there • was a deficit of $106.47. This gives no consideration to any fair return upon the fair value of the property. The years 1926, 1927 and 1928 will show later, an unusually heavy expenditure on account of rebuild - ing the plant throughout. . Exhibit "A" shows earnings and expenses of the present, and the proposed rates, which are set out in a brief statement by the telephone ' company, and" which was sent to every subscriber for his inspection and study. Exhibit "B" is the application to the Commission for in - creased rates at Reynolds exchange. Exhibit "A" was offered as tes - timony and shows that a valuation of the property was made by the engineering department of this Commission as o£ 1925, and continues with additions and betterments up to April 30, 1929, which shows a total of $17,365.21 for the physical working assets. The total annual </seg>
            <seg id="p380">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT revenue, as shown by petitioner's evidence, under the present rates for the first period of ownership from November 11, 1926, to December 31, 1927, was $3,402.93, with a total expense of $3,824.42, causing a deficit in net income of $421.49 or a $421.49 out-of-pocket expense. The total revenue for the year 1928 was $2,981.33 with a total expense of $3, - 331.20, which causes an out-of-pocket expense in the net income of $349.87. Total revenue from January 1, 1929, to April 30, 1929, was $990.66 with a total expenditure of $1,097.13, which shows a deficit to net income of $106.47. Exhibits and testimony further show that the proposed schedule of rates will result in' a total earning of $3,747.30 with an estimated total expense of $3,544.50, which will result in a net income per year of $202.80. Applicant herein has requested permission to set aside 6% for depreciation, but did not present facts or experiences at this exchange to substantiate this amount, for a property of this size and type. It has not been the policy of this Commission to permit a telephone com - pany of this class to set aside separate amount for depreciation and feels that no exception should be made in this case. To expedite accounting in these small exchanges, the Commission has found that the maintenance and depreciation set up should be together. The amount that has been set aside for maintenance and depreciation at this exchange, in the past, has varied from 10% to 12% of the depreciable property, and the reserve still had a balance of $4,249.83 at the close of 1928, with a total fixed investment of $16,141.17. The entire property has been rebuilt in the past two years, cable replacing the open wire, and other improvements having been made. The property removed has been properly charged to the reserve and yet a substantial balance remains in its account. These have been abnormal years, and such large charges to the reserve are not antici-. pated in the near future. Past experiences of this company have shown that somewhere between 10% and 12% of the depreciable pro - perty has been sufficient in the past and there is no reason to believe that it is not adequate in the future. The Commission therefore believes ■ that 10% should be set aside for maintenance and depreciation by the Reynolds Telephone Company. The telephone company proposes to increase the hours of service in case this raise is granted. At the present, service is given at night until 9 o'clock and begins at 6 o'clock in the morning. This period will be extended until 10 o'clock at night and at present there is no service from 12 noon on Sunday until 4 o'clock in the afternoon. That will be from 6 o'clock a. m. until 10 o'clock at night every day of the week. There has never, heretofore, been any differential as between the business and town subscribers- and the farm subscribers. It has been the opinion of the Commission that there should be a differential be- </seg>

Bothwell, appearing for the subscribers, was the only one to testify. When asked if he thought that the proposed rate increase would cause the business phones that are in at the present time, to be taken out, he said he thought not. When asked if he had any idea that a rate increase would have any effect upon the business phones as they are at the present time, his answer was, ''They say so." John McFariand made a brief statement, which reads as follows: "The service since Mr. Miller has been here is O.K. I -was in before, and we haven't had any better service than we are getting now. J don't kick at all on the $1.50 rate if he puts in those hours of service he agreed to. 1 We have no kick at all on the service." Taking the valuation made by the Commission of this property in 1925, showing original cost, plus the additions and betterments to present date, we are taking the figure $17,305.21 as a book value, which seems to be very reasonable, of which said raise will not pay 2% on the fixed book value. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the increased rates are reasonable and will be granted.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on to be heard on the application of the Cam - bridge Telephone Company of Cambridge, for authority to increase its annual allowance for maintenance and depreciation expense.

            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION on the 13th day of July, 1920, (13 N. S. R. C. Reports, 343-347) wmch contains the following provision : "It is further ordered that the company shall set aside monthly not less than $180.00 out of j which to pay all labor and material cost, properly chargeable under the Commission's ac - counting; rules, to maintenance and to replacements of existing properties. Any surplus accruing after these charges are made shall be credited to depreciation reserve account and until further order of the Commission shall be allowed to accumulate." - i The order also shows that the Cambridge Telephone Association was practically a mutual organization and had operated for several years on rates of $1.00 a month for all classes of service. The system was grounded and of rather poor quality. Ultimately it was discovered that the property was in a badly depreciated condition and there were no funds with which to repair and replace it. A corporation was formed and stock was subscribed in the amount of $7,000 in payment of which, all previous stockholders turned in their holdings in the old association and took stock in the new concern. The order of the Commission which provided for a charge against revenues of $180 a month, out of which to pay all labor and material costs, properly chargeable to maintenance and replacements, was apparently made with the knowledge that the company's property was. in a badly depreciated Condition and that a large amount would be necessary to restore the plant to a good operating condition. An appraisal on the cost basis of the physical property of the company was made in the year 1920 and \ the books of the company were set up as provided by the Commission's rules of accounting, in accordance with the assets as disclosed atj that time. A new switch - board was installed and the outside plant in town was made metallic. Cable was substituted for much of the open wire lines. Since 1920, the physical property has increased from $12,038 to $23,688. The common capital stock is now $9,500 and the surplus has increased from a red figure of $904.90, to a credit balance of $13,158.99. The depreciation reserve set up in 1920 in the amount of $3,060.58 has become $6,606.40. Dividends in the last ten years have been paid in the gross amount of fifty per I cent, or approximately five per cent per annum. The above figures (were taken from an audit submitted by the company at the time of the hearing, which involved the rewriting of the accounts from the time of the original set up, because of the fact that they had been poorly kept. It was found .that proper charges to plant had been confused with maintenance and depreciation expenses, also, that general expenses of the company had been charged to maintenance. However, 'the accounts as re-written were classified, using the. best information available as of April 30, </seg>
            <seg id="p384">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT 1929, and will serve as a starting point from which the books of the company will be continued under the accounting rules prescribed by the Commission. Under the original order the annual maintenance and depreciation expense provided for, amounted to the sum of $2,160 per year. Under j the statement of property, as found by the auditor, the company has ; an investment of $23,688.15. The Commission has frequently used • from ten to twelve pev cent of the depreciable property for mainten- j ance and depreciation expense.' In this case ten per cent would in - dicate the sum of $2,368.81 for this purpose. The percentage basis would also permit flexibility in the annual charges to revenues for this purpose. This is necessary as the plant grows and new and more expensive equipment and materials are used. The Commission believes and so finds that the provision in the order under Applications Nos. 4144 and 4293 should be changed and it will provide that the company's annual charge to revenues, out of which to pay for all labor and materials, properly chargeable to maintenance and replacements of existing property, shall be ten per . cent computed on the cost of the physical property and that any surplus which may accrue after these charges are made, shall be credited to the depreciation reserve account. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the following provision in the order of the Commission under Applications Nos. 4144 and 4293, is hereby cancelled and made null and void, namely: . "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall set aside monthly not less than $180.00 out of which to pay all labor and material cost, properly chargeable under the Commissions ac - counting rules, to' maintenance and to replacements of existing properties.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall charge gross revenues with ten per cent computed on the cost of its depreciable property, out of which it shall pay all maintenance and depreciation expenses as determined by the Commission rules of accounting and any surplus accruing after these charges are made, shall be credited to the company's reserve account and be allowed to accumulate until further order of the Commission.

BY THE COMMISSION:, Applicant herein is a new corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska. It was organized for the purpose of acquiring, owning and operating telephone proper - ties and systems and conducting general telephone business in the state of Nebraska, with its principal place of business at Columbus, in Platte County. Petitioner has an authorized capital stock of $2,400,000 divided into 7,500 shares of preferred stock of the (face value of $100 each, and 16,500 shares of common stock of the par value of $100 per share. The preferred stock bears cumulative dividends at the rate of seven . per cent per annum, payable- quarterly and is preferred as to asse'ts and earnings over the common stock. All stock, both preferred and common, has a right to vote, share and share; alike.

Construction work in progress in the sum of $1,125.40 when added to the cost new of the property and the depreciation figure, results in a total appraisal of the fixed assets m the amount of $1,595,463.61 new, and less depreciation in the sum of $1,438,900.06. Applicant has amended its petition and reduced the amount of stock applied for from $1,453,300 par value, to $1,330,000, divided into preferred stock in the sum of $400,000 and common stock in the amount of $930,000 par value. It has also reduced its' estimate of the cost new of physical property including additions and betterments from *], 594,338.21 to $1,475,000.00. This is a reduction !of $119, - 338.21 in the value of the fixed assets. Petitioner has also set up a depreciation reserve against the above figures in the amount of $225,693.31 which has the effect of including the physical properties purchased in the assets of $1,250,306.69, not including construction in progress.

It will have no mortgage in - debtedness and the depreciation reserve is in the sum of $225,693.31. The fixed investment as shown by the annual reports to the Com - mission of the companies to be purchased, as of December 31, 1928, shows an investment cost of $1,115,131. Much of the property came into existence at times when the cost levels of telephone materials and equipment were lower than those prevailing now, and while changes in the properties in the -last few years would reflect the higher price levels, we know that the costs prevailing on this class of properties are about fifty per cent above the pre-war level. It follows that the ratio of $1,115,000 on the investment. basis to $1,475,000 at present price levels is fairly conservative. Total income of the properties purchased for the year ended December 31, 1928, were $298,702.18 and the total expenses amounted to $232,929.31, leaving a net income of $65,772.87. These were the actual operating revenues and expenses for the year of 1928 and in - clude in the expenses an amount for maintenance and depreciation, in the sum of $99,537.82. Under the proposed capitalization reflecting the increase in the value of the fixed property, it will be necessary to increase the maintenance and depreciation charges to correspond •with the new set up. The Commission will use nine per cent for main - tenance and depreciation, computed on the j cost new of the physical property as reduced- by applicant, or the sum of $132,750, for this purpose and substitute it for the figure of $95,537.82 as shown by the operating statement. This has the effect of reducing net income from $65,772.87 to $32,560.69, which will be available for dividends. </seg>

OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This is an application of the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph Company for authority to increase its telephone exchange rates at Wahoo. The matter came on to be heard in the court house at Wahoo on July 25 and 31, 1929. The present monthly rates for exchange service and those proposed in the application are as follows. Rates for special service and equipment will remain the same. </seg>

This amount was spread over the various classes of property in proportion to the in - vestment in each division. Applicant also represented that it will ex - pend $8,506, additional in the near furture to pay the cost of complet - ing metallic service for all of the rural subscribers. This results in a total book figure of $143,727.74. ■ . The book value originated from an appraisal of the competing exchanges which were serving Wahoo, and j were consolidated in the year 1912. Since that time new property has been added to the ex - change and included in the book value at cost. Also, an amount has been included through replacement of existing plant which resulted from an increase in price levels of the equipment, labor and materials ■which, were substituted for the property removed, as compared with the estimated cost o£ the property displaced. The cost of telephone equipment, material and labor has increased rapidly since 1916 and is now approximately 50 per cent higher than at the time of consolida - tion. In other words, the book value started from an appraisal in a period of so called normal price levels, and has been continued on the investment basis to date. On January 1, 1913, the book figure was| $60,587 and on December 31, 1928, it has become $134,864, or an increase of more than 100 per cent, by reason of property added and replaced. During the same period the realized depreciation, or cost of plant removed from service, ■was $52,537 and the credits to the depreciation reserve on account of the Wahoo Exchange were $76,117. The clifference may be regard - ed as a measure of the accrued depreciation in the property since 1913. Petitioner also offered fin appraisal of the physical property in the exchange in the sum of $161,255 reproduction value new, and the same less deterioration in the amount of $142,352. These figures do not include the additions and betterments in the sum of $6,110, nor ..going concern value computed on the basis of ten per cent of the cost </seg>
            <seg id="p392">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT new in the sum of $16,123. The value new is computed on an actual count or measurement of the various classes of plant to which mate - rial, equipment and labor costs have been applied as of June 1, 1929. Working capital was estimated at $5.00 per telephone as a measure of the necessary amount of money, materials and equipment to operate the exchange. The estimated cost new, less deterioration, is intended to show the loss in the value of the property which could be determined by inspection. The testimony is clear on the point that deterioration as used here does not include all the factors of depreciation, such as inadequacy and obsolescence, or accrued depreciation, which are not disclosed by observation. The Commission will use 80 per cent of tie estimated cost of the plant new, or $129,004, in order to allow for the factors of deprecia - tion not included in applicant's definition or deterioration. This per - centage is used for the reason that is a fair measure of depreciation when the physical property is in a good operating condition. Appli - cant's estimate of working capital is arbitrary and does not give credit for the cash advanced by subscribers for service. However, cash working capital does not. include stores and supplies, nor the equipment necessary to be Held in reserve. It has been estimated at 10 to 15 per cent of the operating expenses which is somewhat less than the company's appraisal. The courts and commissions have held that going concern is an element of value in an operated property, however, we will not discuss it here, as it appears to exceed the re - quirements of this case. In summarizing, we have the book figure giving effect to the pro - posed additions and betterments in the sum of $143,727. Also, the appraisal value of the property, less depreciation, as fixed by the Com - mission, plus the above additions in the sum of $137,510. The pro - testants sought to develop the price paid for the properties in 1913. This would be immaterial and. irrelevant for the reason that it does not include all the property at this time, and for the further fact that market values have been rejected by the courts and commissions as a measure of fair value of public utility properties for rate-making purposes. This must be true, as the greater the earnings the higher the market value, and as the earnings grow smaller the value will be correspondingly reduced. The assessed value for taxation has also been discarded as admis - sible evidence in rate cases, as shown by the following: "Even if the assessed values were admissible they would not furnish a safe guide either as to land or buildings, and that is especially true as to buildings, because too many elements enter into an assessment for real estate taxation "which have no place in the determination of the value of real estate, either in the case of private sale, condemnation or confiscation."

            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Revenues and expenses for the year ended December 31, 1928, were $29,486.15 and $28,307.44, leaving a net profit of $1,178.71. Under the proposed rate schedule the revenues become $34,519.00 and expenses $29,179;56, providing a return on the value of the property used and useful for exchange purposes of $5,340.00. In a general way the estimated operating expenses under the proposed schedule were taken from averages of the actual expenses for the preceding four years; however, the company estimated that 108 one-party re - sidence subscribers will change to two-party service under the new rates, causing a loss of six dollars per station annually, or $648. The Commission will take 50 per cent of this figure or $324 with the thought that many of the subscribers will return to the single party service. This is done, having m mind also, that there is no allowance m the company's anticipated revenues for an. increase m the number of revenue stations, although the exchange has grown slowly, but steadily for a number of years. Expenses show that applicant included six per cent computed on the total cost of the property as. a basis for its annual credit to the depreciation reserve. This exchange . includes real estate and an office building, which do not depreciate m the same ratio as the re - mainder of the fixed property. The Commission has said that 5 1 /.. per cent computed on the book value of the property is reasonable where the company owns real estate and exchange buildings-, therefore, the sum of $8,623 as proposed by applicant for depreciation will be. reduced to $7,905 and the exchange revenues will be increased m the sum of $324 for the reasons stated above! Giving effect to these changes the estimated net annual earnings will be increased from $5, - -340 to $6,382, or 4.4 per cent, on book cost. Certainly a schedule of rates that does not produce a return m excess of this percentage on the book cost, is hot unreasonable to the rate payers. ■■''■) ! ■ Under these conditions, the Commission will not find a value of the property as it believes and so finds that the proposed rates are reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation.

Apperanees : For the applicant — ... A. J. McBean, general attorney, Omaha. For the Commission — Hugh LaMaster, assistant attorney general. OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This is a proceeding arising upon application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for permission to discontinue the offering of local zone telephone service in its Omaha exchange, to cancel the toll rates for messages between zones, and to make certain modifications and reductions in its schedule of rates for city- wide service; also, to enlarge the base rate area at certain points. Hearing was held at the court house in Omaha on July 19, 1929, all members of the Commission sitting. It appears from the testimony that the applicant originally operated separate telephone exchanges in Omaha and South Omaha, with different schedules of rates for exchange service and a toll rate for communication hetween the exchanges. In 1908, the subscribers in each of these exchanges were offered the alternative of continuing to take local service at the local monthly rates with a toll charge for </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY! COMMISSION calling the other exchange, or taking "general zone" service at a higher monthly rate which permitted them to call any telephone in Omaha or South Omaha without payment of toll. This rate plan has remained in effect ever since, although Omaha and South Omaha were united politically in 1915, the company contending that social and commercial rather than political boundaries should determine its rate areas. The entire city, including Bellevue and Ralston, is known as the "general zone". South Omaha, Bellevue and Ralston constitute the "south zone", and Omaha proper the "north zone". The existing principle of rate application appears to be theoretical - ly fair. City- wide service is available at a 'schedule of flat rates, and those who take this class of service may call any station in Omaha, Bellevue or Ralston without payment of toll. Those whose telephone use is largely local, rather than city-wide, can avail themselves of the option of taking! local service at a reduced monthly rate, and paying a toll charge on. those occasions when they desire to call a telephone in the other zone. The existing net rates for the principal classes of service are as follows: City-wide Local City-wide Local service service service service for sub- for sub- for sub- for sub - scribers in scribers in scribers in scribers In North Zone North Zone South Zone South Zone Business individual line $10.00 $ 9.00 $10.00 $ 6.00 Business 2-party line 8.00 7.00 8.00 5.00 Residence individual line 4.25 3.75 3.75 3.00 Residence 2-party line 3.50 3.00 3.00 2.50 It will be observed that, in general, the smaller the area which can be called, the lower the rate, the rates for service of the south zone, which is comparatively: small, being very considerably lower than the rates for. city-wide , service. Thus, under the existing schedule, subscribers have their choice of taking local service at a reduced rate plus toll, or city- wide service,, without toll, at a higher rate. The cost of service takes into consid - eration the amount of service available without added expense. Theo - retically, the scheme appears to be a reasonable one. There are practical difficulties, however, in the administration of this, plan, which have caused a good deal of dissatisfaction on the part of the public. The company claims that these difficulties were originally of minor importance. Of recent years, however, as the communities have become more closely united socially and commercial - ly, the disadvantages of the existing rate plan have come to outweigh its advantages. The difficulties are at the present time rather serious. Constant irritation, confusion and misunderstanding have resulted from the artificial barrier erected. </seg>
            <seg id="p398">TWENTY-SECOND.ANNUAL REPORT The most serious of these difficulties seems to be that there is no way in which a subscriber can obtain city-wide incoming service. He may pay the general zone rate, and thus secure the privilege of calling any telephone in the city, but if a subscriber, in the other zone, who has local service, wishes to call him, that subscriber must pay a toll charge. To the business man who has patrons in both zones this is obviously a serious situation. It is so • serious that the evidence shows that approximately seventy-five business and professional men have found it necessary to have both south zone and north zone tele - phones installed in their offices so that their patrons in each zone may call them without payment of toll, thus doubling, and in many cases more than doubling, their normal telephone bill. The amount paid by these subscribers for these additional telephones (known as "foreign central office service") was shown to be over $13,000 per year. This money all comes from the seventy-five subscribers who take the duplicate service. It seems probable that there are many others who need this incoming service just as badly but who do not feel that they can afford to double their telephone bills in order to get it. Another practical difficulty exists in the case of subscribers living near the boundary line between the zones. The communities of Omaha and South Omaha have grown together, so that the territory on both sides of the boundary line is now well developed. People living near the boundary, if they take local zone service, must in some cases pay toll to talk with their neighbors across the street. The situation is decidedly undesirable from the standpoint of both business and residence subscribers. The evidence indicates that it is particularly objectionable to the merchants along Vinton Street who have customers on both sides of the boundary. The foregoing propositions were brought out in the testimony of W. R. Johnson, commercial manager for the company, and were verified by representatives of the South Omaha Merchants Association and Vinton Commercial Club, as well as by the testimony of a number of individual telephone users. From the company's standpoint the existing plan is undesirable because it is difficult to administer. As indicated by the foregoing table, there are four different rate schedules in effect in Omaha at the present time. The existing situation is thus a very complicated one and is hard for thet public to understand. Mr. Johnson testified that it has been very difficult to explain the existing schedules to sub - scribers and that the company has found this to be a constantly re - curring source of irritation, which has required more and more frequent explanation, not only to individuals but to various civic, commercial and community organizations. The company desires tp eliminate this source of dissatisfaction, although according to its estimates, it in - volves a loss of revenue. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAYi COMMISSION It also appears that the boundary between zones is, m the opinion of some of the | leading civic organizations, an artificial barrier to social and commercial intercourse and an obstacle to the development of a unified community. This proposition, -was stressed both by re - presentatives of the Omaha Chamber of Commerce and by spokesmen for the South Omaha interests. In this the Commission is m hearty agreement. The telephone now supplies one of the commonest methods of contact between individuals, both m a business and social way. Any obstacles to its various uses, covering conversation between in - dividuals m the |same community, are irritating and annoying and m so far as possible should be removed. People m the community now affected by this; zoning arrangement have common interests, business and social, and, this unnatural division cannot help but set up an artificial dividing line which should not exist. To remedy these conditions the company proposes to abandon the zone system and to offer only city-wide service to subscribers of its Omaha exchange. It proposes to cancel its schedule for local zone service, including the toll charge, and j modify its schedule for general zone service m such manner that I most of the present local zone subscribers can get city-wide service at no higher rates than they are now paying for the restricted use. |The company proposes to accomplish this m part by the reduction of certain of its present general zone rates and m part by offering of message rate service. The proposed schedule for main-line station's is as follows: Net Monthly Rate Business individual line — flat ] $10.00 Business individual line — message! 5.50 (for 75 messages, Additional messages at 4c) ■ Residence individual line — flat i 3.75 Residence two-party line — flat ....} 3.00 Residence two-party, line— message 2.25 (for 40 messages, Additional messages at sc) Mr. Johnson testified that m his opinion, based on studies of ex - perience with message rate service m other cities and on studies of the calling rate for various classes of subscribers m Omaha, most of those who are now taking the cheaper grades of local zone service will switch to the message rate, and thus receive city-wide service at the same or lower rates than they are now paying for zone service. He admitted that there would be some whose! telephone use would be so great that (he message rates would cost them more than the flat-rate service, and who would therefore elect to take the latter at an in - crease over what they, are now paying. He contended, however, that it was fair that these large users should payj more than those who made comparatively few calls, and that the combination of flat and message rates m the proposed schedule would offer! classes of service suited to the varying needs of the various groups of users, at rates proportionate 389 </seg>
            <seg id="p400">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT to the amount of the use. Several o£ the telephone users who testified at the hearing indicated that the message rate service would be suited to the needs of the members of the groups which they represented, and as it is entirely optional with the subscriber whether he takes the message rate or flat rate service, the Commission is of the opinion that the message rates should be authorized. The company estimates that approximately 28% of its business and 10% of its residence! subscribers will take the message rate service. These estimates appear to have been made upon a reasonable basis, but it is obvious that there may be some variation, one way or the other. However, it is equally obvious, from a consideration of the present and proposed schedules, that the contemplated change, even should the message rate service prove less popular than is anticipated, will be advantageous to the vast majority of Omaha subscribers and disad - vantageous to a very small minority. Residence subscribers m Omaha' proper (both one and two-party) who are at present taking city-wide service will receive the same outgoing service at flat rates fifty cents per month less. Residence general zone subscribers m the South Zone will receive the same outgoing service at. the same rates as at present. Both these classes of subscribers will have unrestricted incoming service, which they do not now have. North local zone subscribers will receive city-wide service at the same rates they are now paying for local service. There are 34,554 residence subscribers m the groups mentioned above, all of whom would be benefited by the proposed change even if no message rate service were offered. As against these, there are 1,294 South local zone residence subscribers who face the alternative of paying a higher rate for city- wide service or chang - ing to another class of service. ' Of these, 164 have individual lines and can get city-wide service at the same rate they are now paying by taking a two-party line. The remaining 1,130 who now have two - party line service at $2.50 per month face the alternative of paying 50c more for city-wide flat-rate service, or paying 25c less than at present for city -wide message rate service, plus 5c for each outward call m excess of 40 per month. When it is considered that most of these people are now paying something m addition to their monthly rate for tolls to Omaha proper, and that many others will undoubtedly find that, with unrestricted incoming service, they can stay within the limit of 40 outward calls per month, it seems probable that very few of these South Omaha subscribers will be affected adversely by the readjustment. As to the business subscribers, there will be no change m rates for those now taking individual line general zone service," but all of these subscribers, who number 1,111, will have the advantage of un - restricted incoming service. Private branch exchange subscribers, who now have 1,173 trunks, with 7,263 telephones, will receive the same outward service as at present, at the same rates, but will have unrestricted inward service and will have the option of message 390 </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION rate service at a lower rate. As against these there are 3,626 local zone business individual line subscribers and 1,176 two-party line business subscribers, both, local and general, who will face the alternative of taking message rate service or paying a higher rate •' for city-wide flat rate service. The Commission believes that many of these, particularly those business men whose chief need is for incoming service, will find' it to their advantage to take the message rates. For those who now pay the flat rates, the size of the increase will be mitigated somewhat by the fact that there will no longer be any inter - aone tolls, and inasmuch as these people must necessarily be large users of the telephone (for otherwise they could profitably uau the message rates) the Commission is inclined to the view that they will, as a general proposition, pay no more than their fair proportionate share, as compared with other groups of subscribers m the city. There seems to be no doubt that the company's patrons prefer the proposed plan to the existing one. representatives of the South Omaha Merchants Association, the Yinton Commercial Club, the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, the Belvidere Improvement Club and quite a number of individual telephone users spoke emphatically m favor of the change, and there were none opposed to it. The Commission can reach no other conclusion than that the proposed readjustment is fav - ored by the telephone users of the community. The company also proposes, as a parti of its plan to abolish zone barriers within the community, to enlarge its base rate area on the south and west, so as to include certain residential territory adjacent to the corporate [ limits which is, from the social and commercial stand - point, a part of the city, or which the company believes will soon become so. There was no opposition to this proposal, and it is difficult to see how there could be, as it will result m the elimination of mileage charges for all subscribers living m the territory which is to be included, and m lowered mileage charges for subscribers; living beyond the new boundary. ; . j . The company estimates that the new i rate schedule will produce about $36,000 per year less revenue than the old. This estimate, set forth m detail m Exhibit No. 2, is as follows: 391 </seg>

Net decrease m revenue . $36,509.55 The larger of the foregoing items are either actual figures taken from the company's books, or are mere arithmetical computations from such figures, and do not involve estimates. Items 1, 2 and 3 are of this class and it can hardly be open to question that if the proposed new rate is adopted the company will lose these amounts of money. Item 4 is an estimate, but the testimony shows that it was the result of a painstaking study, and m the light of the other evidence it appears to be reasonable. The only important item m ■which estimates are in - volved is No. 7. This is supported by an elaborate tabulation at the bottom of Exhibit No. 2, which of necessity is based to a considerable extent on judgment. It purports to show that the company will gain $8,895 per year by the readjustment of the general zone rate schedule, which will offset to some extent the undoubted losses which will result from the elimination of tolls, the elimination of foreign central office service and the enlargement of the base rate area. The Commission will not attempt to say whether this estimate is correct. That can be definitely determined only from experience. Whether it is too large or too small will depend largely on the extent of the drift to message rate service. However, it is clear that the company will lose $30,526 per year m inter-zone tolls, $13,279 m foreign central office service and $6,158 m mileage charges, a total of practically $50,000 a year. Just how much of this will be. regained by the. readjustment of the rate schedule and by the taking of additional service by those who now use the foreign central office service is, m the Commission's opinion, somewhat uncertain. However, it seems quite clear, from a study of the present and proposed rate schedules and the present distribu - tion of stations, that the readjustment will not, m the immediate future, 392 </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION produce enough revenue to entirely offset the undoubted loss of $50,000 per year. Applicant points out that if its request be granted, the change m service will involve an additional investment of approximately $33,000. In the neighborhood of $18,000 of this amount mil be necessary m the supplying of message registers to register the message rate service. The remainder of the $33,000 will be required for additional underground cable necessary because of the increased ) traffic to and from Market central office with other central offices m the city. Applicant also estimates that its expenses will be increased approximately as follows : $752 a year increased maintenance expenses necessary m maintaining additional central office apparatus, message registers and additional underground cable; $5,247 traffic expenses because of additional traffic that, will flow between the Market central office and other offices, following the removal of the toll charge; $2,100 commercial expenses necessary because of additional revenue accounting covering additional tickets under the message rate service plan and the leading and recording of meter readings. Other miscellaneous expense items not specifically listed bring total additional expenses up to approximately $9,000. To offset these increased expenses, applicant estimates that there will be a decrease m taxes which the company will pay, m amount $5,341. This decrease is made up of two items principally; federal net income taxes will be reduced because {of a lower net revenue, and the occupation tax paid to the city of Omaha will be slightly reduced. Deducting the estimated savings m expenses from the estimated increase m expenses, applicant arrives at an estimated additional ex - pense per annum of slightly m excess of I $4,000. i ■ ' The Commission is, therefore, of the opinion, and so finds, that under the proposed schedule the telephone users of Omaha will pay less m the aggregate, for telephone service than at present, m return for which they will receive more service, and a more satisfactory service than at present. There will perhaps be individual instances where a patron would be better satisfied with the present arrangement. However, m a case of this kind, consideration must be given to the interests of the community affected and its telephone using public. But a very small percentage of subscribers involved m this application are adversely affected by results which' might follow its approval. On the other hand, the overwhelming majority either get lower rates for the same service, or added service at the rate now paid. As stated above, no protests were made to the plan herein involved. Certain protests were made respecting the [ | general rate schedule cover - ing the Omaha 1 exchange. The Commission does not believe it neces - sary or desirable, m this proceeding, to raise the question of the general level of rates m Omaha. That matter was gone into very thor - oughly a few years ago, with the result that the Commission's order 393 </seg>
            <seg id="p404">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT reducing exchange telephone rates was enjoined by the United States District Court. The court's decision did not settle the matter for all time, but it did establish pretty definitely the basis upon which the fair return to which the company is entitled under the constitution of the United States, must be computed. The company makes monthly reports to the Commission showing m considerable detail its investment, revenues and expenses. These figures are taken from its books, which are kept m accordance with a detailed system of accounting prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Our accountants have examined these books from time to time, and we are satisfied that they conform to Interstate Commission requirements. It is the Commission's prac - tice to review these monthly reports very carefully, and it has analyzed them with particular care m connection with this case. They indi - cate that the general level of the company's earnings is not such that any reduction m the general level of rates could be enforced at the present time, having m mind the Federal Court decree. This being the case, we believe it would be a waste of the state's money to enter into long drawn out rate case proceedings, including an expensive inven - tory and appraisal of the company's property, before authorizing an adjustment which everybody appears to want. Under the court's de - cision, the Commission seriously doubts that it could be successfully contended that the company is not entitled to the return which, it is now earning. It takes a certain amount of money to produce that return. The present proceeding is not concerned with what that amount' of money shall be, but merely with whether that amount of money shall be produced by the existing schedule of rates or by the proposed schedule. The general level of the rates is not involved. Incidentally, the subscribers will pay less m the aggregate under the proposed sched - ule than at present. The Commission, accordingly, finds that the proposed reclassifi - cation of rates is reasonable, and it will be- approved, to become ef - fective as soon as adequate equipment for registering calls m connec - tion with message rate service can be installed and made ready for - service. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission- that Northwestern Bell Telephone Company be and it is hereby authorized to place m effect on the first day of the month following the date on which adequate equipment for registering calls is ready for service, the tariffs marked Exhibit B, attached to its amended petition herein, and from and after such date to charge the following rates for exchange telephone service of its Omaha exchange : 394 </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: . . This application is presented by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for authority to discontinue what is known as its No. HA-39 1 line, which serves five business subscribers m the town of Doniphan through the medium of a circuit which terminates m applicant's Hanson office. 396 </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Protest to the granting of the request having been made, hearing upon the application -was held at Doniphan on October 21, 1929, the above noted appearances being made. The facts are not m dispute. For approximately twenty years applicant has had this. line running into ! Doniphan from its Hansen switchboard, serving always a very limited number of business sub - scribers m Doniphan. The service carried! with it the privilege of free service to Hastings, which was enjoyed by all subscribers of the Han - sen exchange. Of recent date semi-automatic switchboard equipment has been installed at. Hansen, and Doniphan service has been changed from magneto to common battery, but free exchange of service with Hastings is still enjoyed. Other than these five subscribers, no Doni - phan telephone users are served by applicant. The Hamilton County Farmers Telephone Company maintains an exchange m Doniphan, serving a large number of local residents, including the five subscribers of applicant. Farm subscribers to the northeast, east! and southeast of Doniphan are also served by the Hamilton County company through its Doniphan switchboard. Farm subscribers to the northwest, west and southwest of Doniphan. are served by applicant through its Hansen switchboard. Applicant points' to this so-called duplication of service m Doni - phan as one of the reasons justifying its .withdrawal from this parti - cular territory. ' It also points out that it owns no pole line m Doni - phan and holds no franchise rights to construct pole line within the corporate limits of the town. Furthermore, it states that for many years, m serving these five subscribers, it has used toll poles of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company m carrying the necessary wires from its own pole line adjacent to Doniphan, into and within the cor - porate limits of the town; that on May 9th, last, it was notified by Northwestern Bell representatives that a j re-location of the Bell toll line through Doniphan involved the abandonment by the Bell company of these particular poles; that subsequent thereto, these particular poles were sold to the Hamilton County company; that applicant has made every effort to secure attachment privileges from the Hamilton County company for the use of poles within Doniphan, but that such application has^ been denied by the Hamilton County company, which stated that "better telephone service can be Tendered by having but one local service m the community." ■ ■ Accordingly, applicant, if it is to continue to serve these subscrib - ers, must construct certain additional limited pole line, largely within - the corporate limits of Doniphan, and must secure from town authori - ties, the necessary franchise rights. This it does not desire to do, recognizing the impropriety of what it calls duplicate service m the same community. 397 </seg>
            <seg id="p408">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Protestants allege that m so far as the service itself is concerned, . it is not a duplicate service. They point out that the service -which they secure from applicant is entirely a different service than the service which they secure from the Hamilton County company. Quite naturally the Hamilton County exchange is used m making local calls, either urban, or to rural subscribers served by this company. Service of applicant is utilized by protestants m calling farmers served by applicant m Doniphan trade territory; also, m business calls to Hast - ings. Protestants insisted that Hastings service was of tremendous importance to them; that because of this service arrangement which has been m existence for a period of approximately twenty years, business relations between Doniphan and Hastings have been built up which will be demoralized if the service is to be now discontinued. They also pointed out that toll calls to Hastings would of necessity be routed through Grand Island; that accordingly, m their opinion, they would be slow and unsatisfactory because of circuitous routing. Protestants insisted that they wer,e making an active effort to police the use of service, that the same might 'not be abused by non-subscrib - erg not entitled to it. Applicant representatives agreed that this was being done, and offered no complaint respecting this matter. It was also stated by applicant representatives that this service had always been furnished to all persons m Doniphan who requested it. The fact that the number of users over a period of many years has always been small, indicates that the future demand, if the ser - vice be continued, .will probably m nowise embarrass applicant by lack of necessary facilities ; also, that the local competition such as it is between applicant and Hamilton County company, will be relatively unimportant. The Commission concludes that equities demand a denial of the request. Applicant apparently recognised a right of these subscribers to a continuation of a service which they had enjoyed for twenty years, when it made reauest of the Hamilton County company for the use of their poles m Doniphan, whereby such service might be con - tinued. The conditions which confront applicant, as a result of this denial, do not seem to justify the granting of the request. The plac - ing of a few poles will be necessary. The securing of a franchise under the existing circumstances, will probably not be difficult. The Hamilton County company can obviate this necessary procedure on the part of applicant and avoid the granting of a franchise to a competing company, by permitting applicant, for a reasonable charge, to use the few poles necessary m Doniphan. The competition complained of by the Hamilton County company is not a new thing. Neither is it of such proportions as to occasion any alarm, especially having m .mind the fact that each of the five subscribers of applicant is a subscriber also of the Hamilton County company. Under the circumstances, the Commission concludes that the ap - plication should be denied. 398 </seg>

Applicant also asks authority to cancel all commodity rates now in effect during the months of April to November, inclusive. . We are advised that Lincoln desires to make shipments of ice at the earliest possible date. The application, if allowed, would have the effect of increasing the present rates between many stations in the state. To illustrate, the rate from Memphis to Omaha is now three cents per 100 pounds. If rates in the application were allowed, it would advance the rate to 5% cents per 100 pounds. We will allow the rates to be established from Lincoln, effective immediately and will set the application down for formal hearing for application between other stations in the state. </seg>

The corporation was organized for the purpose of owning and operating electric properties which may be acquired through purchase or by construction. The permanent organization is not completed and cannot be until the necessary stock is authorized by this Com - mission. However, a preliminary agreement has been entered into, whereby C. F. Shaffer is to be president, C. E. Thornburg, secretary, and L. C. Black, treasurer, when the organization is perfected. The officers have subscribed to approximately 60 shares of stock divided between preferred and common as above indicated. Additional shares have been subscribed for by the public in the amount of 47, or a total of 107 shares of the par value of $10,700, subject to the approval of the Commission. A part of this sum has been paid. Petitioner has constructed a transmission line from a point near Grand Island to St. Libory, a distance of eleven miles. It connects with an electric line which receives its supply of energy from the municipal generating plant at Grand Island. Thp new line has just been completed and energized only for a few days. Applicant has fifteen contracts for rural service along the line, and five in the village of St. Libory, where the company has, a 'competitor. The company expects to make additional contracts for both classes of service and install motors and other equipment which will increase the market for service. The line is a three phase circuit operated at 13,200 volts, and costs $1,300 per mile including all expenses, both preliminary and construction. Mr. Black, witness for the company, testified that the fixed charges on this class of construction will be $195 per mile. This, includes interest, taxes, depreciation and return on the stock out - standing, but does not include the cost of current purchased. Esti - mated revenues will be approximately. $115 computed on the assump - tion that every rural customer will pay not less than $75 a year for service. The sale of current to the five customers in St. Libory is not included in this calculation, but the $75 per year, per rural cus - tomer, anticipates the liberal use of motors and other electrical ap - pliances, which may be used on the farm. Mr. Thornburg, the engineer for the company, testified that $75 revenue ner customer would not be experienced in the first or second year, in fact it might take from three to five years to develop the use of current to the extent of making the investment profitable, after all expenses have been paid. Mr. Thornburg admitted that the annual revenue per rural customer as determined by experience over a large territory, is more nearly $50; however, he maintained that certain localities might be selected wheTe his estimate would be realized. Under the proposed charges the rural customer would have to use .00 kilowatts per month to produce a </seg>
            <seg id="p417">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION revenue of $75. He thought that 45 kilowatts would be used the first year and probably 70 kilowatts in two years. At this point witness- Thornburg testified as follows: .-■.-■• • ■ "Q. As a matter of fact, hasn't. the estimate here been' based on future developments A. Certainly. Q. It isn't what you can do now? A. No. Q. What you hope to dot A. Yes, that is all we can hope to do, but it is future-. development. Q. How long is it going to take to develop this property? A. . In the neighborhood of three years. Q. As soon as thatf A. I mean after it is built. Q. Wouldn't it take five years f A. Very likely will." . The company has an option on a small distribution system in the village of Inland, and a similar contract for the purchase of the electric plant in the village of Vesta. If the current is purchased at. Grand Island the line to Inland will be approximately 30 miles in length, and will cost $1,300 per mile. The line to Vesta will be built, from Tecumseh, and will be operated at 0,600 volts at a cost of $1,100 per mile. No rural contracts have been made on these lines and the demand for service in Inland and Vesta will be small. It follows that the financial success of the enterprise depends on the development of rural service, and there is no reason to believe that the number of customers per mile, on the proposed lines will exceed the experience on the property constructed. This is a new enterprise. The company does not own or operate any properties from which revenues will be available to tide over the lean period incidental to the development of jits rural lines, which the testimony shows may take from three to five years. The proposed lines will not supply any towns of much importance as a market for electricity. The dividends on the preferred stock have been fixed at 7 per cent and the bonds will be sold at a price to yield approximately the same ratio. A large percentage of the capital applied for will be sold to the public and the promoters will take one-third of the capital subscribed in preferred stock. Fixed dividends, interest on bonds, taxes, depreciation and operating expenses begin when the pro - perty is placed in operation, regardless of ; the time it may take to develop the market for service which the company anticipates, and which will require a number of years. The Commission believes that it is its duty to know that the property capitalized should have sufficient earning power to pay its. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 7903 In the matter of the application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for authority to discontinue its telephone exchange at Blue Springs, transferring subscribers to its Wymore exchange. Appearances : For the applicant — W. E. Bell, commercial superintendent, Lincoln, W. H. Caman, district manager, Beatrice, II. F. McCulla, assistant commercial superintendent, Lincoln.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This application is presented by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for authority to transfer subscribers now being served at its Blue Springs exchange, to its Wymore exchange, and to discontinue and abandon the Blue Springs exchange. Blue Springs and Wymore are neighboring communities, the corporate limits of the one joining corporate limits of the other. As of October 30th last, applicant served at its Blue Springs ex - change, 18 business subscribers, 163 residence subscribers and 387 rural subscribers. With the exception of three or four rural subscri- </seg>
            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION bers served on one line out of Wymore, all rural subscribers in the Blue Springs-Wymore territory are served from the Blue Springs switch - board. The Blue Springs exchange is magneto, or what is more com - monly known as the "handcrank" system in town, and grounded, rural. Due to construction of electric transmission lines in the rural dis - tricts, applicant states that it is extremely difficult to furnish satis - factory rural service over grounded lines. If the application be granted and service rendered through the "Wymore switchboard, town service will be common battery and rural service metallic. This, of course, will afford a much higher type of service to Blue Springs subscribers than they are now receiving. Town subscribers of Blue Springs will be car - ried to the Wymore switchboard by cable and the same classification of service available as now. Applicant estimates that an additional in - vestment of approximately $35,000 will be necessary in metallicizing its farm lines. It. now has sufficient office and switchboard capacity at the Wymore exchange to serve Blue Springs subscribers. At least one additional operator, however, will be necessary to handle the addi - tional volume of service. In the determining of questions involved in this case, it is neces - sary to give consideration to the provisions of Chapter 144, Laws of Nebraska for 1923, page 357, which read as follows: "Maintenance and Retention of Existing Telephone Exchange. — A telephone exchange, central office and switchboard shall be maintained where there is an existing exchange by one or more telephone companies operating more than ten exchanges, in every incorporated city or village in the state of Nebraska, and no ex - ■ . isting exchange, or central office shall be abandoned or discon - tinued by any company or removed to another city or village i except by the written consent of at least sixty per cent of the sub - scribers or patrons who had rental or exchange service contracts . ... with said company at a date six months before the circulation of any such petition, and until said petition has been presented to the State Railway Commission with the proper number of signers and upon a hearing the said Railway Commission issues. a report, finding, decision or order permitting such discontin - uance or abandonment." The provisions of this chapter are applicable in the instant case,. in that applicant is "operating more than ten 'exchanges" in Nebraska. In line with such requirements, applicant has circulated a petition a - mong its town and rural subscribers on the Blue Springs exchange, the same being signed by 341 subscribers, this being slightly in excess of' the necessary sixty per cent of the subscribers of the exchange. The petition which was signed by rural subscribers, reads as. follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p420">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT "We, the undersigned patrons of the Blue Springs exchange do hereby request that the line by which we are connected to the Blue Springs exchange, be made metallic circuit, and that we be connected directly to the Wymore exchange of the Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph Company, at Wymore. . ,"^ e are wilUn R t0 P a T fo F this improvement, the regular established metallic service on the Wymore exchange, namely $1.75 per month net, beginning at the time that the lines have been made metallic and the connection made to the Wymore switch. "It is our understanding that in addition to the service on the Wymore exchange, we will be entitled to an additional ex - change, and we are making choice in the column below of the exchange that we individually prefer. "It is our understanding that a majority preference for any exchange by lines, shall be the choice of the entire line." The petition which was signed by the town subscribers, reads as Hollows : "We, the undersigned patrons of the Blue Springs exchange hereby request that we be connected directly to the Wymore ex - change of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, of Wv - more, Nebraska. J "It is understood that in making this request, that we ex - pect to pay the regular established rate for service, that is now in effect on the Wymore exchange, namely $3.75 per month, net, for individual business telephones, $2.25 per month net for in - dividual residence, $1.75 per month for two party residence." It being suggested by one of the protestants that there might be some names on the petitions not properly there, at the request of the Commission, a local committee carefully checked and reviewed the original signatures and reported that no irregularities could be found. Those handling the solicitations for applicant, were present at the hearing. Each of them stated that the signatures on the peti - tions checked m red, were original signatures, actually placed there by the party whose name appeared. They also stated that it was their purpose to clearly and definitely explain to the subscriber exactly what applicant desired to do: furthermore, that in each instance the signer was afforded full opportunity to read the petition which he was signing, carefully, and that in instances, at least, where the signer himself did not actually read the petition, it was read to him by the solicitor before his name was actually attached thereto. There was no allegation made on the part of any subscriber whose name was attached to the petition, of misunderstanding of what was proposed or misrepresentation on the part of those circulating the petitions </seg>
            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The legislature has required that sixty per cent of the subscribers must agree to the abandonment of an exchange before the Commission can allow such action. The legislature having seen fit to occupy the field, the Commission concludes that this sixty per cent represents both the maximum and minimum expression of public desire neces - sary. Accordingly, it appears that the only questions before the Commission for determination relate to sufficiency and efficiency of the service proposed, and reasonableness of the rates. The Commission is of the opinion that service through the Wymore switchboard will be entirely satisfactory and [of a high standard. The central office equipment is practically new. The change from the "handcrank" type to common battery service should result in a much more efficient service to the town subscribers. The metallicizing of the farm lines should markedly improve the service over that which it is possible to render on a grounded line, where transmission lines are operating in the same general territory. Farm line subscribers are to be given their choice of one additional exchange without addi - tional charge. This should result in the farmer subscriber being able to talk to neighbors who possibly reside in the twilight zone be - tween any two exchanges, without the payment of toll. The service to all classes of subscribers should be markedly improved by the pro - posed change. [; . - If and when the change is made, it is proposed to charge Blue Springs subscribers, rates based on the present Wymore schedule. The Commission has recently had before it, application of the Lincoln company involving the rates of the Wymore ! exchange. The schedule now in effect is one recently authorized," after most careful considera - tion of all factors involved in a rate case. I There appear to be no elements in the proposed change herein whichj might vary, to any great extent, net earnings and fair return on the fair value of the properties. Accordingly, it seems unnecessary to discus's in great detail in this application, the. reasonableness of the rates, the schedule having been recently considered by the Commission. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the | Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company be and the same is hereby authorized to discontinue and abandon its Blue Springs exchange ' at such time as it is able to serve present Blue Springs subscribers from its Wymore exchange. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, effective on the first day of such month following the change in service^ applicant herein is au - thorized to publish, and collect from such present Blue Springs sub - scribers, the schedule of rates published and collected at its Wymore exchange. </seg>

' ' ' I ■•■■■•' "■Hearing upon the application was held at Commission offices September 27, 1929, the above noted appearances being made. Applicant has recently incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. It has outstanding, 1,000 shares of no-par stock which is closely held, none of which is to be offered to the public for sale. The proceeds of the proposed bond issue will be used to retire current indebtedness incurred in the purchase of certain properties, the con - struction of plant now in place and for further additions and better - ments necessary. . ' ' ■ Properties owned by applicant include telephone exchanges at Morse Bluff, Prague, Weston and Malmo in Saunders County, and Elgin, in Antelope County. These exchanges serve approximately 1,218 company owneid stations and 143 switched stations. The com - pany owned stations include both rural and town subscribers. The corporation operates approximately 19 miles of toll circuit and 91 miles of trunk circuits connecting various exchanges with each other and with neighboring exchanges. The exchanges are all magneto and the service furnished, in the main, is grounded. The plant and equip - ment at each of the exchanges are well constructed and with the pos - sible exception of the Elgin exchange, have' all been well maintained. It was stated that a reconstruction program was contemplated for the Elgin exchange, particularly with respect to the farm lines. Applicant alleges that the investment or book cost of the total properties is not less than $114,000. For the purposes of the bond </seg>
            <seg id="p430">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT issue and on behalf of the company handling the bonds, a hurried valuation of the properties was made by an appraisal engineer of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company. Quoting from page 3 of this report introduced as Exhibit A, the following is noted respecting the probable value of property. "Probable Value of Property I have not made a detailed inventory and appraisal of the property nor do I consider one to be necessary in this case. However, after having seen considerable of the property and having studied available reports and other data pertaining to the property, I am of the opinion that the fair value of the pro - perty at the present time is not less than $100,000. This amount is equivalent to $82.10 per company-owned station or approxi - mately $70.10 per station for the value of physical plant exclusive of land and buildings and material and supplies." The bonds are to be sold at 03y 2 , the discount on same to be amortized ' through the life of the mortgage. The mortgage is what is commonly known as an open end mortgage and provides that further bonds shall not be issued in excess of sixty per cent of any additional property which may be added to the corporate holdings. The mort - gage also requires that not less than 5^ per cent annually shall be set up on a figure of $109,000 to cover the matter of reserve for accrued depreciation. Net earnings before depreciation approximate $12,964 or 3.79 times the amount of the bond interest. If non-recurring charges to expense and certain salary items which applicant has agreed to waive until such time as earnings have increased sufficiently to cover such salary, be excluded, the net earnings after depreciation and taxes, available for interest, dividends and surplus, approximate slightly in excess of two times the interest on the proposed bond issue. The properties will be free of all indebtedness except bonds, if and when the bond issue be authorized. It appears that interest on the bonds will be properly protected. The issuance of the bonds seems to be necessary and reasonably proper for the purposes of the corporation. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Citizens Telephone Corporation of Blair, be and the same is hereby authorized to issue and sell at not less than 93 J /2 per centum of par value, its six per cent 15-year first mortgage bonds in amount of $57,000. </seg>

COMMISSIONER CURTISS PRESIDING OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Petitioner herein is a public service corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Delaware. It owns and operates electric and gas properties in Nebraska and South Dakota. The company has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell 14,500 shares of its no par common stock for cash, at $70 per share, which is approximately its book value, none of which will be sold to the public, and 3,000 shares of its six per cent cumulative preferred stock at not less than face value, to be sold to customers. The company will sell its' own preferred stock to customers, at actual cost not to exceed seven dollars per share. The securities now issued and outstanding have been approved by this Commission. . ■ '.' The net additions to property from April 30, 1928, to July 31, 1929, amount to $1,318,545.85. This sum represents the actual cost to the company of additional property after deductions have been made for plant retired from service. The latter has been credited to the plant account in the amounts at which the property was placed on the books of the company. Applicant has supplied the labor and purchased the materials and equipment, for a large amount of the property added. Under these circumstances the company has added ten per cent to the direct costs to cover general supervision and office expenses. When equipment was installed by contract, the contAct price to which a small percentage has been added for supervision, has been taken into the plant figures. The" gross sum of additions is $1,038,820.85 from which property retired has been deducted in the amount of $320, 281. The funds necessary to finance this construction have been provided by money borrowed, liquid reserves and surplus. Applicant now proposes to retire accounts and notes payable which represent funds acquired for construction, and convert the reserves and surplus from a fixed to a -liquid form. </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Total income for the twelve months ( ended July 31, 192», was $1,182,923.11. Total fixed charges including insurance, taxes, de - preciation, etc., amount to $720,063.36, leaving a balance for surplus or dividends in the amount of $462,859.75. Dividends on the out - standing stock have been paid in the sum of $363,824.50, leaving a net credit to the surplus account after dividends, as a result of the year's operation of $95,035,251 The additional dividends on the preferred stock -will be $18,000 arid interest on notes and accounts payable will be reduced in an amount not less than $55,000. The application was amended at the time of the hearing to ask for authority to issue additional six ner cent preferred stock, share for share, for seven per cent preferred stock now outstanding in the amount of 27,566 shares, as the old stock may be offered for sale or exchange, but the seven per cent stock will not be called. The Commission believes and so finds jthat the issuance and sale of securities applied for is reasonably required for the purposes, of the corporation.

Petitioner owns and operates a three phase transmission line, with branches extending from a. point near Grand Island to St. Libory, and now has under construction a single phase transmission line, from the city of Hastings to the village of Inland, which will also have branch lines to serve customers m adjacent territory. The line to St. Libory is supplied with electric energy from the municipal generat - ing plant at Grand Island, under contract for ten years, and the line from Hastings to Inland will be supplied with electricity by the plant at Hastings, under a similar contract. The officers of the company have advanced $13,000 for the con - struction of the St. Libory line and $8,000 for the materials which are now on the ground for the line from Hastings. It will require approxi - mately $3,000 additional to complete both projects, or a total of $24,000. This figure does not include the bonuses collected from customers m various amounts, which have been expended on con - struction, nor general expenses incurred on both projects which will amount to approximately $4,000.

OPINION AND FINDING • 7 .-■''.: . ) RANDALL, Commissioner: The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway Company on November 12, 1929, filed an application with the Commission for authority to discontinue trains Nos. 32 and 33 on the Wynot branch of their line for the reason there is not sufficient business to warrant the continuing of running said trains, and that trains Nos. 30 and 31 could furnish all the transportation facilities necessary to handle the business offered to the company on that branch line. * The application states that for the first ten months of 1929, train No. 32 carried only slightly more than an average of one carload </seg>
            <seg id="p442">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of live stock per trip, and that during the past five years, there has been a steady decline of live stock shipments offered on said line and during: the first ten months of 1929, there was only a total of 325 cars of live stock carried on trains Nos. 30, 31, 32 and 33 as compared with 1,269 cars for the year 1925. That grain shipments from all towns on said branch, and on all trains for the first ten months of 1929, amounted on the average to less than one car per day. On the four trains now operated on the branch, the average number of cars, both loaded and empty, are less than three cars per train, for the ten months period, and that the total revenue for the same period, from all four trains on the branch was $48,439.11, while the total expense of operating said branch to accommodate said four trains was $104,608.13, making a loss of more than $50,000. Applicant further avers that trains Nos. 32 and 33 are unnecessary, as trains Nos. 30 and 31 can handle all of the business offered the company on that branch. The testimony of Mr. E; C. Blundell, superintendent for the railroad company, supported by exhibits made up from the records of the company, showed that in January 1929, there were 33 cars of stock shipped to the market on said branch, that the greatest number of cars handled in any one day during; the month of January was six, and that was from all points along the line. For the month of February there were 36 cars, seven being the greatest number any one day during the month. In March there were 63 cars, the greatest number in any one day being seven. The month of April, 52 cars, the greatest number in any one day was seven, The remaining months of the year show that 33 cars were the greatest number during any one month and the greatest number offered in ony one day was five. That during - the months of September and October there were only 14 cars, each month, or an average of practically one-half car a day. During the year 1925 there was loaded at stations on the branch 1,269 cars of live stock; 1926—970 cars; 1927 — 764 cars, 1928—629 cars, and in the ten months of 1929, 325 cars. These figures Bhow a steady decline in live stock offered for transportation • during the period reflected. . Mr. Blundell also testified and offered exhibits to substantiate his testimony showing the loading of grain on the branch for the ten months of 1929 as follows: January 60 cars, February 26 oars, March 19 cars, April 13 cars, May 3 cars, June none, July 19 cars, August 52 cars, September 43 cars and October 29 cars, making a total of 264 cars. These cars were handled by the four trains now being operated. Mr. Blundell also offered in evidence an exhibit showing the number of cars handled by trains Nos. 30, 31, 32 and 33, in and out of Coburn during the month of January. The average number of oars </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION handled on trains 32 and 34 was .5 to three cars on the two trains, and on 31 and 33 the average maximum oars for the two trains was 12 and the minimum was four. The total {average per train was 3.45 . cars. The total average on all trains was 13.80, but the minimum daily average per train was 3.45 cars. The class of power used on . the line is F-9 engines with capacity powerj of 570 tons, equal to about 15 loaded cars, and this class of engine can handle all the cars offered to the company with one train, as shown by the daily average. During the month of February the average was only 2.80 cars per train, the daily average on all trains was 11.21 cars. In March the daily ■ average per train was 3.34, daily .average on all trains 13.35. During the month of April there were handled 228 loaded cars and 97 empties, on an average of 3.17 cars per train, a daily average on all trains of 12.50 cars. In' May there were 177 loads and 67 empties, or a daily average of 2.44 cars per trainband a daily average of all . four trains of 9.76. In June there were 178 loaded cars and 72 empties, a daily average per train of 2.50 cars and a daily average of all trains of 10 cars. July, 189 loaded cars and 73 empties, a daily average of 2.43 cars and a daily average on all trains of 9.70 cars. In August there were 299 loaded cars, 94 empties; a daily average of 2.99 cars and a daily average on all four trains of 11.96 cars. In September, 236 loaded cars, and 47 empties, a daily average per train of 2.38 cars, daily average of all trains 11.33 cars. October 241 lr jded cars, 56 empties, daily average per train of 2.84 cars, a daily average on all four trains of 11.37 cars! In November there were. 232 loaded cars and 103 empties, daily average per train of 3.20 cars, daily average all four trains 12.81 cars. During the months from January to October 1929, inclusive, the average cars per train east bound were 3.84 cars, westbound 4.61 cars. These cars were destined to all points on the branch. - ■ ••■ ■• :, ■ • During the month of November 1920, the grain loadings on the branch were 60 cars, live stock 18 cars, miscellaneous 2 cars, or a total of 80 cars, with an average carload per day of 3.07. Mr. Blundell's testimony, as shown by exhibits taken from the records of the company, show that on train No. 30 (there were 1,229 passengers or an average of 4.76 passengers per day for the ten months of 1929; that on train No. 31 there were 2,109 passengers or an average of 4.3 passengers per day, on train No. 32 there were 2,016 passengers or an average of 7.8 passengers per day. On train No. 33 there were 2,647 passengers or an average of 10.26 per day, the daily average on all trains was 6.78. This includes half -fare passengers as well as adult fares, but does not include caretakers) of stock riding .on stock contracts. The witness further testified, as shown by exhibit No. 10, that the mail earnings from January to August] 31, 1929, were $5,216.16, or an average daily earning for the four trains of $16.65. Mr. Blunde'll further testified as shown by exhibit No. ,9 that the total earnings of </seg>
            <seg id="p444">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT the Wynot branch for the year ending August 31, 1929, was $48,439.-11. An average daily earning of $154.75, an average daily earning per round trip $77.37. That the expense for the operation of the four trains was $43,116, an average daily expense of $137.71 and an aver - age expense per round trip of $68.85. These expenses are for the handling of the four trains now operated, but do not include any wages ; for station agents, track and bridge forces, station supplies and ma - terials, or any maintenance expense, nor any return on the investment, or for depreciation of equipment and way and structure. Mr. BlundeU also testified that there was no question but what trains Nos. 30 and 31 could handle all the business offered to the company for transportation on the branch and would make a saving to the company of $2,272.29 monthly, providing trains Nos. 30 and 31 remained on the same schedule as at the present time, but if the sched - ule was rearranged so that the time of train No.- 31 was changed to leave Sioux City at a later hour than the train does at present, it would cause an added expense of $210.60 overtime. This would make the expense for running the train $2,482.89 monthly, or $29,794.68 per year for out of pocket cost, if the revenue from all sources would produce the same amount as shown for the year ending August 31, 1929, in the future, this would leave a net revenue. from operating expenses of trains Nos. 30 and 31 of $18,644.43 instead of a deficiency as is in the present case with the four trains running. The starting of No. 31 out of Sioux City at 11:00 a. m. instead of 9:05 a. m. as is now the schedule would cost the company $210.60 more in wages than at the present time, owing to the fact that the train crew would receive pay for some overtime, which would make the difference between the figures of $2,272.29 monthly, and $2,061.69, but the company is willing to make this concession in order to give the citizens of the branch an opportunity to leave Sioux City for the branch stations at a later hour. At the present time with the four trains being operated there is no Sunday service on the branch, and there will be no change in this respect in the operating of trains Nos. 30 and 31. The schedule of - fered by Witness Blundell is for train No. 30 to leave Wynot at 5:00 a. nu arriving in Sioux City at 8:05 a. m. and returning as No. 31 leaving Sioux City at 11:00 a. m., arriving Wynot at 2:50 p. m. This would give passengers two hours and fifty-five minutes between trains in Sioux City and stock shippers desiring to return the same day they ship their stock could do so, providing train No. 30 arrived in Sioux City on time, and their stock was marketed without delay. Exhibit No. 5 shows that the total earnings of trains Nos. 30, 31, 32 and 33 were $48,439.11, -while the total operating expenses directly chargeable to the operating of these trains was $79,407.17. This shows </seg>
            <seg id="p445">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION an out-of-pocket loss of $30,968.06 in the operation of these four trains. The petition of the applicant included $25,200 for material and supplies furnished stations, track, bridges, etc., which was de - ducted by the Commissioner as not being! chargeable to the operating of these trains. Wynot is the farthest station on this line, about 57 miles, from Sioux City. This would make the round trip for trains Nos. 30 and 31, about 114 miles to cover,, which is not an unreasonable distance to travel during the day. There are practically eight stations on this branch proper, -where the train crew would be required to do station switching and ' give other service which J would consume some time, but the schedule offered by the railroad company could be easily main - tained, except in case of heavy snow storm, or some other unforseen conditions. '•■■ ■ ' ■ ' ■ -I There has been a gravel road constructed from Sioux City to Ponca, which is about 26 miles from Sioux City. The highway for the balance of the line to Wynot is not gravelled, but certain seasons of the year the roads are in such condition that there is considerable trucking of live stock to Sioux City and merchandise from Sioux City to all stations on the line, much less, however, at Wynot than at other stations owing to the longer distance and condition of the road. Since the advent of the automobile and truck, branch line railroads have suffered very materially the loss of business, passenger, L. C. L. freight, and livestock, with the increase of highway building, this class of service will be increased and the railroads will continue to lose business in all three classes of service above mentioned. It wjll of necessity bring about a curtailment of railroad service that is not being used by the people. Railroads have nothing to sell but service and if they are furnishing service that is not being purchased by the public, it is an uneconomic loss and the deficiency will have to be made up by increase in rate's on those | who do patronise the road, which would be very unfair. Railroads should be required to give adequate service and the question of what is adequate service is left largely to the demands of the public and the decision of the State Railway Commission. The citizens in the average town along this line dislike very much to give -up any service that they now have, regardless of whether it is necessary or not, but after the matter j has been carefully gone over and they have been shown that service is being rendered at a great loss, they are usually willing to accept what is considered reasonable or sufficient service. About the only service that a majority of the people require of the railroads at the present time is their mail and express, except when the roads and weather aT6 in such condition they can not use their automobiles or trucks. If the application of the railroad company in this case is granted, it will leave the various stations with mail service going, east in the early morning and mail </seg>
            <seg id="p446">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT will arrive from the east in the early afternoon. This will give the people an opportunity to answer the mail received on that day to go out on the early morning train. While in the past, towns along this line have been receiving mail twice a day, they will only be receiving the one mail offered by this service, which to some may at first seem quite a curtailment of service, yet the Railway Commission can not require trains to be run at such an enormous loss to the company fpr the purpose of serving a limited number of people with two daily mail deliveries. ' ..;' There is very little passenger, business as the records show, and very few, if any, who go to Sioux City would care to return the same day, but if they should they will have about three hours to transact any business they desire and return on the train leaving Sioux City at 11:00 a.m. After considering all the testimony and facts and consulting the records in the files of our office, we are of the opinion and so find that, owing to the lack of patronage of the trains on the Wynot line, the application of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Rail - way Company to discontinue the running of trains Nos. 32 and 33 on the Wynot branch, should be granted, and that the proposed schedule offered by the railroad company, shown in Exhibit No. 6, for the run - ning of trains Nos. 30 and 31, should be authorized by the Commission and the railroad company be permitted to operate their trains on that proposed schedule between Sioux City, Iowa, and Wynot, Nebraska, on and after the first day of January, 1930. ORDER ■&gt; IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company to discontinue running trains Nos. 32 and 33 be, and the same is hereby granted, trains Nos. 30 and 31 to be run on the following schedule: Going West Going East 31 30 Ex.

OPINION ANO ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant, Nebraska Pipe Line Company, is a Nebraska corpora - tion, engaged in the construction of a natural gas pipe line from a point near Chester to Grand Island, Hastings, Kearney and interven - ing points. A considerable portion of its lines is already laid, but it will not actually commence business for two or three months. It will handle none but its own gas, which will be purchased from the produc - ing company and will be received from the producing company's lines near the Kansas-Nebraska state line. It! will not sell gas at retail, but will wholesale it to different local gas companies owning and op- </seg>

There is no authorization in the articles of incorporation for any transportation of gas for a consideration. Section 3 of the applicant's articles of incorporation is as follows : "The general nature of the business to be transacted by the corporation shall be the installation, construction, ownership, and / or leasing and operation in the state o£ Nebraska and else - where, of pipe lines, compressor stations, and other suitable equipment and apparatus useful for the handling, transportation, delivery and sale of the corporation's natural gas to the gas distribution systems of cities, towns, villages and of private com - panies in the State of Nebraska and elsewhere; also the explora - tion and test drilling for natural Eras, also for oil, also the drilling, installation, ownership and / or leasing, and operation of natural gas wells, also oil wells; also the ownership and / or leas - ing of such real estate as may be necessary or advantageous for carrying out foregoing corporate purposes." The company holds no local franchises in Nebraska. The appli - cation states that the corporation "has not attempted to exercise the right of eminent domain". The application also states that right of way easements have been acquired by private negotiations, contract and purchase. The applicant asks permission to issue and sell 5.000 shares of common stock, and 10,000 shares of preferred stock, each share of each class to be of the par value of $100. It also asks permission to issue bonds in the sum of $1,000,000, face value. The securities issued are to be used in connection with the construction of the pipe line and its appurtenances. Applicant states that none of the securi - ties will be sold to the public. While the applicant asks permission to issue the securities above specified, it questions the jurisdiction of the Commission to act. It assigns, as the reason for the apparently inconsistent position assumed by it, that it is uncertain as to the legality of the proposed securities, without approval, and it desires to avoid any question concerning their validity. We consider it proper for the company to file an application, as a matter of caution, although denying the power of the Commission to act in the premises. It is our duty, carefully to examine our power with respect to any case, whether a question as to jurisdiction is propounded by the parties or not. This is an obligation resting upon all tribunals, and is always precedent to the exercise of authority. Defiance Water Company v. City of Defiance, 191 TJ. S. 184. The power of the Commission over security issues isj based. upon section 676, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, as amended by </seg>
            <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY; COMMISSION ■ I section 1 of chapter 168, Laws of Nebraska for 1923, and by section 1, chapter 141, Laws of Nebraska for 1925. It reads in part as follows : "A common carrier or public service corporation doing business in the State of Nebraska, may issue stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness payable at periods of more than twelve (12) months after the date thereof, when necessary for the acquisition of property, the construction, completion, ex - tension or improvement of facilities, or for the improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the discharge or lawful refund - ing: of its obligations: Provided, and not otherwise, there shall have been secured from the Nebraska State Railway Commission an order authorizing such issue .1. . ." The jurisdiction of the Commission depends upon the answers to the questions: A. Is the Nebraska Pipe Line Company a common carrier? B. Is it a public service corporation? The answer to the first question is, under the statements in the application and the evidence offered by the {applicant, easily answered. A common carrier is defined under section 5483, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, as follows : "The term 'common carriers' as used herein shall be taken to include all corporations, companies, individuals and associa - tion of individuals, their lessees or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, that" may now or hereafter own, operate, man - age or control any railroad, interurban or street railway line, operated either by steam or electricity lor any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, telegraph and telephone companies and any other carrier engaged in the trans - mission of messages or transportation of passengers or freight for hire." Section 5081 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska provides, in part, as follows: "Any company, corporation or association, formed or created for the purpose of transporting, transmitting or conveying crude oil, petroleum or the products thereof, or gases, from one point, in the state of Nebraska to another point in the state of Nebraska for a consideration are hereby declared to be common carriers;" As the company does not hold itself out to carry gas for other persons, and as it does not operate "for a consideration" or "for hire," it can not be considered a common carrier. The answer to the second question, as to whether or not the ap - plicant is a public service corporation, is one of much difficulty. </seg>
            <seg id="p450">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT xne applicant has filed an extensive and well prepared brief, which has been carefully examined by us.

The cases are not in harmony with one another, but as above stated, the preponderance seems to be against considering the applicant a public service corporation. In view of this condition and of the fact that the legislation on the subject of pipe lines in connection with rates and service confines the jurisdiction of the Commission to such lines as are operated as common carriers, we feel that we should not assume jurisdiction of this matter.

            <seg id="p452">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Accurate information as to operating revenues and expenses are not available at this time as the extended service has not been in existence long enough to show definite results, however, the testi-: mony at previous hearings before the Commission in connection -with applicant's business indicates that reasonable profits may be expected. The company has been required to charge operating 'expenses and credit its depreciation reserve annually with not less than three cents per mile, computed on the total number of bus miles. The company has actually been charging about four cents per mile, which it has found necessary because of the expiration of leases on terminal facili - ties, which have been carried in the property account. However, the Commission will continue its previous requirement that the reserve shall not be less than three cents per mile for each bus, until more accurate information has been developed. The Commission believes and so finds that the issue and sale of stock applied for is reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation.

Changes in service proposed by applicant are set forth,, quoting from its application, as follows: "3. Applicant desires to establish, effective Sunday, Dec - ember 22nd, 1929, additional through' passenger train service through Chicago, Omaha and Lincoln and for that purpose desires to extend the schedule of its mail trains Nos. 25 and 30 now operating between Chicago and Omaha (so that the same will op - erate between Chicago and Lincoln and carry passengers through - out their runs and, as an incident, to the extension of said trains and the operation thereof as passenger trains, applicant desires to revise and amend its existing train schedules so that the pre - sent train No. 12 will leave Lincoln at 7 } p. m., arriving at Omaha at 8 :15 p. m., leave Omaha at 8 :30 p. m. and arrive at Chicago at 8:45 a. m.

            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Applicant points out that the local travel on its trains between Omaha and Lincoln is very light, approximating an average of about one passenger per train mile per day on its local trains. The prin - cipal passenger traffic is between the stations of Lincoln and Omaha, and reverse, and Lincoln, Omaha and Chicago. The revised schedules purpose to inake marked improvements in the through service. This Commission recognizes the diminution of local passenger service. The public highway between Omaha and Lincoln is paved and graveled. The individual automobile and the common carrier bus serve all of the local communities served by the Burlington. There are sixteen husses each way between Lincoln and Omaha operated by the Interstate Transit Lines and the Burlington Transportation Com - pany. These sixteen busses serving Omaha, Lincoln and intermediate towns, are operated between the hours of 6:30 a. m. and 10:30 p. m. Having in mind this service, the further fact Ithat the privately owned automobile is frequently used for short local trips, and the still further .fact that the Burlington, in its revised schedules, still provide for local service between Omaha and Lincoln, it is the Commission's con - clusion that the request can be granted without the necessity of a formal hearing. Accordingly, an order will be entered authorizing the request, subject to complaint. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State RaUway Commission that the application of Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to revise its schedules of; passenger train service between Lincoln and Omaha be and the same is hereby authorized, effective December 22, 1929, such authorization to cover the proposed schedules set forth in the application herein.

SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER CURTISS, Chairman: In the Commission's original order herein entered under date of December 5, 1929, effective December 22, 1929, it authorized cer - tain changes in passenger train service on the part of applicant Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, between Omaha and Lincoln. Among other things, the order provides that its train No. 24 leaving Lincoln at 10:45 a. m. and arriving at Omaha 11:58 a. m. shall stop on flag at all points on Sunday for the purpose of picking up or discharging passengers. Such flag stops were established be - cause of the fact that train No. 8, eastbound, leaving Lincoln 7 :55 a. m. and arriving Omaha 9 :30 a. m'., was not scheduled to operate on Sundays. However, under the schedules which have become effective December 22nd, train No. 8 is operated as a Sunday train.. Applicant points out that for this reason, in the original applica - tion herein, it failed to request authority to discontinue flag stops of train No. 24 on Sundays, the matter being an oversight. Having in mind the fact that train No. 8, eastbound, between Lincoln and Omaha is a train operating ahead of No. 24 in. the morning on each day of $the week, it seems entirely proper that the supplemental application herein for authority to discontinue said flag stops on Sundays, of train No. 24, should be granted. .

Bratt, district I manager, for the sale of the Lindsay Telephone Company property to 1 the Monroe Independent Telephone Company. The application recites that the Lindsay Telephone Company is unincorporated, but that the Monroe Independent Telephone Company is a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, and is a public utility within the meaning of the constitution and laws of the state of Nebraska. That a portion of the telephone exchange property and system used and employed in rendering telephone service in and about Lindsay is owned by the Lindsay Telephone Company, the principal portion of this pro - perty being located in the town of Lindsay, j Applicant further recites that a portion of the telephone exchange property and system used and employed in rendering telephone service m and about Lindsay is owned by the Monroe Independent Telephone Company and that the principal portion of the property owned by the Monroe Independent Telephone Company is located in the rural com - munity immediately adjacent to the town of ILindsay. The remaining portion of said telephone exchange property and system consisting largely of central office equipment is jointly owned and operated by the Lindsay Telephone Company and the Monroe Independent Tele - phone Company. The property of the Lindsay Telephone Company including the jointly owned property is usedjand employed in render - ing telephone service to the Lindsay Telephone Exchange to approxi - mately 146 stations, the majority of which is located within the cor - porate limits of Lindsay. The property of the Monroe Independent Telephone Company at said telephone exchange, including jointly owned property is used and employed in rendering telephone service to approximately 168 stations, the majority | of which are located in the rural community adjacent to the town of Lindsay. The individual - ly and jointly owned and operated properties of these two companies in and around Lindsay constitute a single arid complete telephone ex - change system. Neither of said properties constitutes by and in itself a complete telephone exchange. </seg>

This sale would include all rights and franchises of every kind and descrip - tion used and useful in rendering telephone service in and about said Lindsay and the said Monroe Independent Telephone Company aerees to purchase said property and to operate and maintain the same under the present and existing rates and charges therefor unless and until the same are lawfully changed. The question of whether or not these two companies, which are at the present time somewhat amalgamated, are competing companies and come under the provision of section 3, article 10, of the constitu - tion of the state of Nebraska, is to be determined by the Commission While it is true that these companies do not have paralleling lines in' competition with each other, there is a certain element of competitiou which in the judgment of the Commission would require the sixty-day publication notice to be given, as provided for by the constitution and the statutes of the state of Nebraska. . . After considering all conditions of the application the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the acquiring of the Lindsay Tele - phone Company by the Monroe Independent Telephone Company is a step in the right direction and will be very beneficial to the patrons ol both companies and the public.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 8164 ■.■■■.•■• I In the matter of the application o£ the Union Pacific Railroad Company for authority to discontinue trains Nos. 265 and 266 between Kearney and Hastings. OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: I This application was made by the Union Pacific Railroad Com - pany in words and figures as follows: "Comes now Union Pacific Railroad Company and shows to the Commission that Trains 265 and 266 are mixed trains, running between Kearney and Hastings, (a turnaround); that train 2G5 leaves Hastings at 1 p. in. daily, except Sundays, and returns from Kearney to Hastings, leaving Kearney at about 4 :30 p. m. and arriving at Hastings at about; 7 p.m.; that said trains are not carrying sufficient business to justify the expense of operating them'; that the merchandise carried on this run, amounts to a daily average of about 500 lbs. 1. c. L, most of which is from the south consigned to Kearney and points on the Kearney Branch; merchandise from the east averages about 500 lbs. a day about one-half of which is groceries and canned goods, from Omaha to Hayland, the remainder being 1. c. 1. from Hastings. The total revenue from express handled on this run amounts to only about $20.00 per month. The trains average about 10 passengers per week, most of the passengers going from Hastings to Kearney, with an occasional passenger for points north of Kearney, or west of Kearney. The revenue derived from this run is very light and insufficient to justify the expense. ' "Applicant further alleges that it operates three through freight trains in each direction over this line between Kearney and Hastings; that if the Commission permits the discontinuance </seg>
            <seg id="p460">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of said trains 265 and 266, the service performed by them will be performed by tbe tbru " freights, which will afford ample service ; that these thru freights are not now handling 1. c. 1. business, or picking up or setting out of cars, between Kearney and Hastings; that applicant now operates, and will continue to operate, a local train between Kearney and Grand Island, which serves all points between Gibbon and Kearney and that the only points affected by the proposed change will be between Gibbon and Hastings. "WHEREFORE, Applicant prays for an order authorizing it to discontinue trains Nos. 265 and 266." Trains Nos. 265 and 266 are being operated between Kearney and Hastings daily. From Kearney to Gibbon this train traverses the main line of the Union Pacific. At Gibbon they traverse the short line between Gibbon and Hastings to connect with the St. Joseph and Grand Island for Kansas City and the southeast. These trains have been doing local business between these points. There has been no local business to speak o£ between Kearney and Gibbon, as that is on the main line of the Union Pacific and i^ handled by the main line trains. The business done by this train at Denman, Hayland and Newmarch, those being the three towns on the line between Gibbon and Hastings, has been practically, negligible as the application recites. There is, however, considerable carload shipments from these points mentioned above, which will be taken care of by the railroad company by their through trains, which will continue to run over this line, so there will be no lack of service in the furnishing of cars or the shipment of carload or L. C. L. freight, that will be handled by the through trains. The only service that the citizens between Gibbon and Hastings will be deprived of will be the passenger and express service, but from the records the discontinuing of. this service will not seriously discommode the public, or citizens of that locality, as these two trains have not been patronized to any considerable extent. Ordinarily, the Commission does not grant permission to discon - tinue trains without a hearing, but this is an emergency case and the service that will be furnished seems to be adequate. The Commission will grant this application without a hearing, subject, however, to written complaint from interested citizens and towns and, if the al - legations therein contained are of sufficient magnitude to require it, the Commission will hold a hearing and give interested parties an. opportunity to be heard.

Result of conference held. COMMISSIONER RANDALL PRESIDING. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This supplemental matter originated in the application of one of the motor transportation companies to file a surety bond in lieu of its present liability insurance policy. Upon receiving the application, the Commission determined that there should be a general order in reference to surety bonds that might be offered by motor transporta - tion companies to cover their liabilities. It was therefore decided, by the Commission, to take up the matter with the bus operators and the surety companies and a resolution was entered calling a con - ference of all interested parties for the consideration of this subject. The conference was duly held in the offices of the Commission, on October 4, 1929, and was attended by representatives of several of the motor transportation companies and by representatives of several insurance companies. As a result of the conference and of our investi - gation, we find that it is necessary for us to formulate some general rules concerning such instruments. Question wes raised by agents of the insurance companies as to the power of this Commission to accept a bond instead of insurance policy. The statute provides that no motor transportation company may operate without filing "a liability insurance policy or bond". The agents, thru their attorneys, filed an extensive written memoran - dum, opposing the acceptance of bonds. . The matter was. submitted by the Commission to the Attorney General, who rendered a written opinion, advising us that we are required by the terms of section 4, chapter 150, Laws of Nebraska, 1927, which reads, in part, as follows: "No motor transportation company shall operate in any manner as such, in the state of Nebraska until there has been filed with the Nebraska State Railway Commission a liability insurance policy or bond, which shall be approved by the Com - mission and be in form prescribed by. the Commission, in such sum and with such other terms and provisions as the Commission may deem necessary, adequately to protect the interest of the public, having due regard for the number of persons and amount of property affected." • to accept either an insurance policy or a bond, whichever the applicant may wish to file. He states that we have no choice in the matter; that </seg>
            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION either a bond or a policy of insurance, if in proper form and in suffici - ent amount adequately to protect the public, should be received. The Commissioners agree with this interpretation of the law and will therefore accept bonds, if requisite in form jand amount, and signed by suitable surety companies. The distinction between a bond and an insurance policy should be kept clearly in mind. While they equally protect the public, they are entirely different as affecting the bus operator. If an operator carrying insurance has an accident resulting, in $10,000 damage, the insurance company pays the person or persons injured (or settles judgments for the loss) and the operator of the bus is relieved o£ liability and owes the insurance company nothing therefor. His whole liability to the insurance company is renresented by the premium he pays. If, on the other hand, an operator having a bond has a similar accident with the same damage resulting, arid the bonding company pays the persons injured the $10,000, it thereupon looks to the opera - tor for the repayment of the $10,000. In the one case the operator loses nothing. In the other case he loses $10,000. In other words, an insurance policy protects the operator and thelpublic while an indemni - ty bond protects only the public. The cost of an insurance policy is, as may be readily seen, much greater than the cost of a bond. In all casea a bonding company requires indemnity from the operator, and unless he can furnish such indemnity he cannot secure a surety bond to protect the public. It may be that an insurance policy is more desirable than a bond, but that is a matter of policy that only the legislature has power to determine. The legislature has, however, placed upon this Commission the duty of determining the amount and condition of the bond. As to amount, the only direction of the statute is that the bond "shall be in such sum . . . adequately to protect the interest of the public, having due regard for the number of persons and amount of property affected". We have given the subject careful 1 consideration and have determined that the amounts set forth in the table below are the sums that will adequately protect the public. ORDER . IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission, that indemnity bonds required by Chapter 150, Laws of Nebraska for 1927, for motor transportation companies, shall be in the following amounts: j </seg>

The sum of the amounts, as increased by the respective percentages, will be the penal sum to be named in the bond. For example : If a motor trans - portation company has a fleet of seven busses, three of which carry twelve or less passengers, each, and four of which carry over thirty passengers each, the penal sum of the bond will be $196,000. The minimum bond for a bus carrying twelve passengers or less is $20,000, and that for a bus carrying more than thirty passengers is $80,000. Therefore, we compute for three busses, 180% of $20,000 or $36,000, and for four busses, 200% of $80,000 or $160,000, thus giving a total of $196,000 as the penal sum. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all bonds be signed by at least one surety company as surety. Such company must be duly author - ized by the insurance bureau of the department of trade and commerce of the state of Nebraska, to execute such instruments, and shall have a reserve as provided in Rule 11 of Resolution 102 of this Commission. The bond shall take effect at 12:01 o'clock a. m., of the date of its approval, and shall remain in effect until canceled by the motor trans - portation company, or by the bonding company, or by an order of this Commission. If canceled by either the motor transportation company </seg>

Such bone, may be canceled by this Commission if the surety becomes inadequate or if the bus operator is operating m a negligent or unlawful manner or is violating an order of this Commission; reasonable notice of sich proposed cancellation shall be given to the operator and to the surety, who shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard. No change of ownership of the busses operated, or any of them, will affect the validity of the bond, unless such change of ownership is duly approved by this Commission.

Objections were filed and the matter came on to be heard in the offices of the Commission, June 11, 1929 At this time parties of interest who appeared, entered the following stiDulation. 6 "For" the conduct of supply line circuits the conduit shall extend entirely across the right of way and terminate in a man - hole at each end. For the conduct of signal circuits the conduit ; shall extend at least 24 feet from the center line of the nearest track, measured at right angles to said center line, on both sides at which points risers may be erected. The risers shall in no event be of a height above ground which exceeds the distance from the base of the riser to the nearest rail. In cases where it is necessary to guy the riser pole toward the track, the min - imum clearance of 24 feet from the center line of the nearest </seg>
            <seg id="p470">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT track shall be provided from the base of the guy wire. In the event of the construction of additional railroad tracks, the conduit shall be extended so as to provide the minimum clearance above provided from the center of the nearest track. The vertical clearance between the bottom of the rails and the top of the conduit shall not be less than 42 inches, except where the ballast section for cleaning, is less than 42 inches. In the latter case, this clearance .may be reduced to not less than 30 inches, and in all cases the top of the conduit shall be so located as not to be exposed between riser poles." On July 3, 1929, Geo. M. Kloidy, secretary of the Nebraska Tele - phone Association and special . representative thereof, notified the Commission that he had failed to receive proper notice of the hearing held by the Commission on the 11th day of June. The Commission than set the matter down for further hearing on July 10, 1929,. at the offices of the Commission and testimony was taken. The record shows that the independent telephone companies objected to the stipulation for the reason that a distance of 24 feet from the center of the railroad tf ack, measured at right angles, is greater than the clearance provided in the National Electric Safety Code and in the specifications issued by the Bell System of telephone companies. They also objected for the reason that the above clear - ance would add to the cost of undergrade crossings and necessitate the construction of overhead crossings in the interest of economy, whereas, public safety requires undergrade crossings where they are practicable and further, that the above clearance would put a burden on the use of the public highway at railroad crossing's, which is not necessary to the ordinary and customary operation of a railroad. An. engineer for the Burlington Railroad Company testified that a net clearance of 22 feet on either side of the track is required to move the company's equipment, described as the "Jordan Spreader" over its tracks, when it is ready for operation. It is also necessary to remove signal posts, wing fences, etc., on the railroad right of way. lie also testified that it is assembled for operation at the location where it is used and for purposes of transportation between points, where construction, or reconstruction work is carried on, it is taken down and re-asseinbled in such a manner that it only requires a clearance of an ordinary freight car used for transportation purposes. Furthermore, all the operations of the machine are carried on only up to, and not including the public highway. . In other words, the machine is used only in reconstruction and maintaining the company's roadway and only in event of widening the company's embankments or general construction of the same, is the machine used and in transporting this equipment between points on the company's system, it is put together in such form that it does not require any greater lateral clearance </seg>

The bill is entitled "An act relating to taxicabs and public cars and providing for the filing of insurance policies, surety bonds or securities with the State Railway Commission for the protection of the public; and to provide penalties for the violation thereof", and defines a "taxicab" to mean "A motor vehicle, fitted with a taximeter which indicates the fare for the distance covered, used within or without the corporate limits of any city or village as a common carrier for the transportation of passengers for hire, not including mterurban motor busses and motor coaches or busses conducted as a part of any street railway system or service, or urban busses equipped to curry more than seven (7) passengers . or other carrier under the general control of the Nebraska State Railway Commission pursuant to chapter 150 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1927", and a "public car" to be "a motor vehicle available for hire by the public with or without a chanffeur, not equipped with a taximeter, nor operating over a fixed route, nor upon a fixed schedule but engaged only upon call or by arrangement or agreement including rented or leased vehicles to be •driven by the lessee or bailee and livery vehicles". Sections 2 and 3 of the act read as follows: "Section 2. Insurance or Surety Bond Required.— No per - son, firm, association or corporation shall operate or use any ta"xicab m any manner as above defined m the State of Nebraska until there has been filed or deposited with the Nebraska State Railway Commission either a liability insurance policy or a surety bond with an approved surety company as surety or negotiable and salable securities at the option of such person, firm, assooia - tion or corporation but which shall he approved by the Commis - sion, m such sum and with such other terms and provisions and on such conditions as the Commission may deem necessary ade - quately to protect the. interest of the public having due regard for the number of persons and amount of property affected." "Section 3. Letting, Renting, or Leasing of Public Cars.— Any person, firm, association or {corporation engaged m the business of letting, renting or leasing public cars m any manner as above defined to be operated upon the public highways shall be subject to the provisions of the preceding section m the same manner and to the same extent as if such person, firm, associa- </seg>
            <seg id="p476">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT tion or corporation were actually engaged in the business of carrying or transporting passengers for hire." Section 4 is the penalty clause and provides that those who violate such Commission order as shall be entered in the matter "shall,, upon conviction thereof be deemed guilty o£ a misdemeanor and shall be fined in any sum not exceeding five hundred ($500.00) dollars, or shall be imprisoned for a period not exceeding three (3) months in the county jail of the county where the individual or corporation violating the same shall reside, or has its principal place of business, or both". It will be noted that under the law, all operators of "taxicabs" and "public cars" are required to file with the Commission either liability insurance policy or surety bond or negotiable and salable securities. It becomes the Commission's obligation to prescribe the amount of liability insurance or surety bond or negotiable securities necessary and the terms and provisions and conditions surrounding the furnishing of same, that "the interest of the public, having due regard for the number of persons and amount of property affected" shall be adequately protected. General notice of same having been given, conference with the op - erators of "taxicabs" and "public cars" respecting the subject matter was held in the house chamber in the capitol, Lincoln, on May 24th, at which time parties and companies above listed in appearances, were represented. Those entering appearances represented most of the larger operators of both taxicabs and public cars in most of the larger cities and towns in the state. The principal questions discussed had to do with the amount of liability insurance or surety bond, or negotiable and salable securities necessary to adequately protect the interest of the public, and the relationship which should properly exist between liability insurance and surety bonds, and negotiable securities. • The discussion developed the fact that many insurance companies doing business in Nebraska, would not write this class of business; also, that by those companies handling this class of business, Ne - braska was divided into three rate groups, namely, Omaha, the highest rated district; Lincoln, the next highest rated district, and all other cities and towns in Nebraska, the lowest rated district. Several proposals were made by those present respecting the possible attitude the Commission should take in' the administration of the act. It was proposed by some that the cost of providing, any insurance might be so burdensome as to put certain operators out of business; that accordingly, the law resulted in confiscation of pro - perty and should not be enforced by the Commission under these circumstances, because of being unconstitutional. The Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ■ . ' . ■ finds itself unable to agree with this reasoning. It is not the province of the Commission to declare laws unconstitutional, although the Com - mission shall keep in mind the cost of protection, in so far as this is possible, in fixing the amount of insurance necessary. Certainly it is not the desire of the Commission to arbitrarily put an operator out of business as a result of its order herein.' ■ ' '&lt; ■ \ It was also argued that the amount] of insurance or other pro - tection required should be graded on a basis of the size of the city, the operators in the larger cities being 'required to provide greater protection than those in smaller cities. Again, the Commission can - not agree with this logic. A person injured in a smaller town or city, is entitled to the same quantum of protection as a person injured in a larger city. Undoubtedly, the likelihood j of accident is greater, the larger the city, but this factor is one which should be given considera - tion in .the amount of premium paid — a matter over which the Commis - sion has no control. However, as noted above, the premium on liability insurance is much higher in Omaha and Lincoln than other cities and towns in the state. Again, it was proposed- that the amount of protection required should give consideration, to the operator's past accident record, his financial responsibility and his willingness and ability to meet any and all claims which might arise as the result of accident, this to be determined upon the basis of past experience and history. It does not seem possible or practical to make any] such refinement. Financial responsibility and ability to constantly meet all claims for damage out of the company's treasury, are matters extremely difficult to determine in the first instance, and perhaps more difficult to be con - stantly informed about, after having once been determined. While a favorable accident record is significant, yet it is an unstable factor upon which to base protective requirements, since accidents are not entirely avoidable and oft-times come in rapid succession over a brief period of time after a previous long period of favorable experience. However, high type operation with few accidents and minor claims should indeed be reflected to the advantage of the operator, in the premium paid. ■ .■■';';■■•■'-■■ j " ■ . . Generally speaking, the accident experience of the operators pre - sent, both taxicab and public car, was highly favorable. Many op - erators of both "taxicabs" and "public cars" had, over a period of years, experienced no accidents worthy} of mention. The highest claim paid for injury resulting from anv one accident, where one or more than one were injured or killed, totalled $6,500 ; the next highest $3,500. Other than these two claims, no operators reported claims paid in excess of a few hundred dollars, j Several operators, on their own motion, carry liability insurance in amounts $10,000 to $20,000, |. and others in amount $5,000 to $10,000. They were emphatic in their statement that they would not hazard their personal estate by oper- '. </seg>
            <seg id="p478">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT at ing without this protection. Some of them were located in smaller cities, and each advised their business was conducted with a profit to themselves. Other insisted that their volume of business would not permit o£ carrying insurance. It is difficult to say with exactness, just what amounts of - liability insurance, surety bond or negotiable and salable securities will adequately protect the public interest. If the Commission were to conclude that adequate protection to the public means the pro - viding of financial security against the most disastrous accident, that might be imagined, it would undoubtedly put most "taxicab" and "public car" operators in the state out of business, and require those who might survive, to increase their rates. It is not thought that this was the intent of the legislature. The Commission feels that the i'avornblc accident record of these operators in Nebraska should properly be considered in reaching conclusions. No single accident was experienced in which one or more than one was injured, that in - volved the payment of claims in excess of $0,500. The overwhelming majority of claims involved only small amounts. This experience covers operation of hundreds of cars in most of the larger cities and many of the smaller cities of Nebraska, over a period of many years. Since the experience of both taxicab and public car operators respect - ing accidents was quite alike, the Commission will require protection from each in similar amount, at least until such time as its observation from administration of the law, leads it to conclude that requirements should be different. It was the consensus of opinion of those present that liability insurance providing protection in amount $5,000 where only one individual was injured or killed, and $10,000 where more than (Hit 1 individual was injured or killed, should be the maximum require - ment. The Commission .concludes that liability insurance in this amount will satisfy the requirements of the law. Testimony of insur - ance men was to the effect that if the amount were to be made less than this, the advantage in reduced premium would be very in - significant. This, it was explained, was due to the fact that the insurance company furnishes legal counsel in litigated cases, and oftentimes, where judgments returned involve the actual payment of no monetary claim or claims of small amount, the actual expense of litigation borne by the insurer is great. Furthermore, the Commission does not believe that the mandate of the legislature would be complied with if protection in less amount than this were Dermitted. It does not believe that the providing of liability insurance in this amount will actually put any operators out of business, although in instances it may necessitate slightly increased charges which the traveling public should willingly pay for the added protection. Since the law also permits the furnishing of "surety bond" or "negotiable and salable securities" and since there may be some op - erators who desire to avail themselves of one of these options, the Commission must also prescribe the amounts necessary if either </seg>
            <seg id="p479">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION be furnished. Surety bonds could, no doubt, be secured at much less expense to the operator than liability insurance. However, the operator purchases no actual protection to his personal estate in pro - viding 1 ■ surety bond, since the bonding company: is only called upon to satisfy judgment arising from accident, after any collateral which may have been required and the personal estate of the insured, subject to levy and execution, have been exhausted. The Commission con - cludes that in no event should the bond or negotiable security be less than the maximum insurance of $10,000 j required for one accident, ' where more than one person is injured or killed. . To multiply this maximum amount of $10,000, where more than one car is operated, by the number of cars operated, to determine the amount of bond or negotiable securities, does not seem necessary to adequately protect the public. It is entirely unreasonable to Jexpeet that each and every uar. owned and operated by any one individual, company or corporation will, within so brief a period of time as to make impossible the filing of additional bond or negotiable security, have major accidents, each of which involves the maximum obligation of $10,000. Nothing in the past experience of these operators in Nebraska would justify even one with the wildest of imagination, Teaching such a conclusion. The very fact that the legislature provided these further options, leads the Commission to conclude that it was presumed such regulations as it might prescribe concerning them,* would, be practical and sane ami based upon such actual experience of the operators as the Commission could secure, rather than upon imaginary and fanciful possibilities. The Commission, in its order, will prescribe a gradation, which, based upon such facts and data as it now has at hand, will be entirely sufficient to adequately protect the public. The order will require that the surety bond or securities be filed with the Commission and that they shall be constantly maintained in the amount set forth. Such surety bond or negotiable securities shall not be liable for the satisfaction of n judgment, as the result of any one accident in excess of $5,000 where only one person is injured or killed, and $10,000 where more than one person is. injured or' killed. The Commission will require immediate report to be made to it of all accidents and of all actions instituted .in court covering claims for damage arising from accident. . . If negotiable securities are furnished, the Commission will require that they shall be of the same nature as those accepted by the state treasurer in . the securing of state funds, that is, federal, state, municipal, county or school district bonds. Objection was filed by certain operators of "public cars" more commonly known as "rent-a-car" of "drive-it-yourself," to the Com - mission order requiring protection to the driver of such cars or the passengers, other than the driver, where the driver is not an employee of the company. It was stated that experience had shown such pro - tection lends itself to violent abuse through the medium of fraud - ulent claims which were difficult to meet, in that the company coujd </seg>
            <seg id="p480">TWENTY- SECOND ANNUAL REPORT not have a representative present at the time of the alleged accident, 1 the driver being: other than an employee of the company, that as a result, where insurance carried this additional protection, the' premium was of necessity burdensomely high. Furthermore, it was contended that such persons were hot within the contemplation of the legislature as "the public". The objection would, of course, not lie where the driver of a public car is an employee of the company renting the car, or respecting taxicabs, since a representative of the company is always present and false claims of injury are more easily resisted. However, it would be of equal force respecting the use of taxicabs where the driver is the person renting or using the car, no employee of the com-, pany being present. The Commission finds the objection is a valid one. There seems to be no good reason why the state should compel protection for the driver of a public car or taxicab, who controls absolutely the movement of the car, or protection to the passenger who is in the car at the invitation of the driver. The company renting the car is, of course, responsible for accidents resulting to the driver or the passengers from the use . of cars not properly equipped with brakes, lights or other recognized facilities for handling and control - ling the ear. It is not thought that the driver of such a car, or the passengers, are such part of "the public" for the purposes of this legislation, as to require protection contemplated in the act. The law seems to contemplate protection, not only to persons, but also to property; Based upon such information as the Commission has, the conclusion is reached that protection in amount of $1,000 covering possible damage to property, including- baggage of the passenger, re - sulting from one accident, is adequate. The Commission is also providing in its order certain endorsement which it will require shall be attached to each liability insurance policy. The endorsement is, in substance, the endorsement which is required on liability insurance policies covering the operation, of common, car - rier motor busses. Insurance companies have acquiesced in the fur - nishing of such endorsement. It is thought that the supplying of same will more adequately protect the public and .-will not be burdensome, to the operator purchasing the insurance. It should be understood that the Commission, in dealing with such subject matter, is confronted with problems previously foreign to its work. Under the administration of the law, additional information will be gained, and it may be that as these facts and data accumulate, substantial revision of the order herein will be found necessary that the mandate of the legislature may be carried out, i. e., adequately to protect the interest of the public, having: due regard for the number of persons and amount of property affected. </seg>

Dear Sir: v ! 1 have o cxamiue(1 th e questions concerning the jurisdiction of the Acbraska btate Railway Commission, presented in Formal Complaint No. 589, ttyhe v . C . B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. (22 N. S. R. C. Reports 144-151). The complaint, after stating the position of the complainant and the character of the business conducted by the defendant, alleges: "That at McCook the defendant a large part of the time requires the firemen on its passenger engines to throw and handle a large number of switches in taking said passenger engines from the roundhouse to the depot and from the depot to the roundhouse after the completion of a run, and that the same requirement is made by the defendant of the firemen at Omaha in taking pas - senger engmes from the roundhouse to the depot and from the depot to the roundhouse after the completion of a ran, and in taking switch engines from the roundhouse to the Douglas Street lard and back again. "That said requirement by the defendant of its firemen is unsate and dangerous to the public and defendant's employees, because: 1. When the fireman is switching only one man is left on the engine who cannot watch both sides to see that everything is in the clear. • 2. When the switch is on the opposite side of the engine from the engineer the fireman when on the ground throwing a switch cannot signal to the engineer. 3. Firemen are dressed for work on the engine in front of the fire door and their health is endangered when required to get off the engine in cold weather to throw switches when sweatv and unsuitably clothed for outside work." </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The complainant prays that a hearing 1 may be held and that an order may be made commanding the defendant to cease and desist from requiring its firemen to handle and ithrow switches as set out in the complaint. There is also prayer for general relief. The answer, among other matters, alleges that the Nebraska State iviiilwuy Commission has no jurisdiction under the constitution and laws of Nebraska, particularly under sections 5521 and 5522, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, .1922, and that it is I also precluded from exer - cising jurisdiction over the subject matter by virtue of the Railway Labor Act, being chapter 8, title 45, U. S. Code. (1928 Supp. 275). • Sections 5521 and 5522, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 read as follows: "-The State Railway Commission shall have and exercise jurisdiction over the service, facilities and equipment of all rail - roads in this state and shall, upon due notice and hearing, render judgment, orders, and decrees as to the efficiency, sufficiency and safety of the service, facilities or! equipment furnished; and if any service, facilities or equipment is found inadequate, in - sufficient or unsafe, the State Railway Commission shall order such changes therein or additions thereto made as shall to the Commission seem necessary to render the same sufficient, effici - ent and sufe. . "The provisions of this act shall apply not only to those having business relations with the common carrier, but also the general public. This act shall not be j construed as a limitation upon the powers of the State Railway Commission which have heretofore been granted, but as supplemental thereto. It is further provided that nothing hereinj contained shall be con - strued as giving the State Railway Commission jurisdiction or control of the relations between the railway companies and their employees and employees' orders, either contractual or other - wise.'' ■ ■ These sections have never been before the Supreme Court of this state. They were considered by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission in Ford v. Union Stock Yards Co., 14 N. S. R. C. Reports, 144. The Commission said: "The last provision of section 2 of the statute is purely negative. It is merely a limitation of ithe act by its own termsi It neither increases nor diminishes the power vested in the Com - mission by the constitution." It seems hardly likely that the State Railway Commission was deprived of jurisdiction by that statute. </seg>
            <seg id="p496">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Our conclusion is that the second ground of objection to juris - diction, namely, that Congress has acted upon this subject to the exclusion of the states, must be sustained. ■ When Congress legislates on a matter of interstate commerce, whatever power the states previously possessed thereover is suspended. The Railway Labor Act governs all interstate carriers and the de - fendant is such a carrier. It is provided by that act (Section 152) that it shall be the duty of all carriers, their officers, agents and employees, to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules and working conditions, and to settle all disputes arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise. It seems to be the purpose of the new act to leave the carriers and their employees to settle their own relations, so far as possible, without public intervention. See American Labor Legislation Review 1926, Volume 16, Page 140. It also seems clear that the term "working conditions" covers the subject matter of tbe present complaint. See Decisions of U. S. R. R. Labor Board, Volume VI, (1925) Page 273. The act provides for the creation of several boards to settle disputes between the carriers and their employees. While the procedure is voluntary, it is the duty of both parties to invoke it. If invoked and carried through it be - comes the basis of a decree of the U. S. District Court which, subject to appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, binding upon all parties (Section 159). We regard this procedure as an occupation of tbe field by Congress, under the commerce clause of the federal constitution. In Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Washington, 222 U. S. 370, it was held that Congress had so acted upon the subject of the hours of labor of interstate railroad employees by enacting the Hours of Service Act as to preclude a state, during the period between the date of that act and the time when, by its express terms, it should go into effect, from making or enforcing as to such employees, the local regulation limiting hours of labor. The principle of the decision in the Washington case was recog - nized and re-affirmed in Erie R. Co. v N. Y. 233 U. S. 671. In numerous cases relating to safety appliance acts of Congress have been held to supersede state legislation on the same subject. Southern R. Co. v. Railroad Commission of Indiana, 236 U. S. 439; Staten Island Rapid Transit R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 16 F. (2d) 313; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Napier 2 F. (2d) 891; Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. 272 IT. S. 605. </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Our conclusion is that under the authorities cited above the pro - visions of the Railroad Labor Act mast be deemed to exclude the State Railway Commission from exercising jurisdiction over the subject matter of this complaint. Very truly yours, , ■ , 0. S. Spillman, Attorney General, By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, January 16th, 1929 . Mr. Hugh Drake, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office.. Dear Sir: • The following question propounded by you, viz : "Does a railroad company violate Sec. 5337 Compiled Stat - utes of Nebraska for 1922 by operating over its road a work train with a crew having only one brakeman?", has been considered. Section 5337, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, is as • follows : "It shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business m Ne - braska to operate or run over its road, or any part thereof, or to suffer or permit to be operated or [run over its road, or any part thereof, outside of yard limits any freight train which is not manned with a crew consisting of |one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and two brakemen: Provided, main line local freight trains running one. hundred' miles or more and carrying passengers, local merchandise and doing station switching shall be provided with a crew consisting of one conductor, one engineer, one fireman, and three brakemen." The section above quoted was before the Supreme Court m State v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company. 212 N. W. 535. In that case the question was whether or not the term "mixed train" fell within the term "freight train" as used m the statute. It was held that it did not. The court m its opinion employed this language: "In this case the appellant complains because the district judge refused to issue an order m mandamus requiring the ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p498">482 TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT pellee, a railway company, to have and to use two brakemen on its mixed trains. Appellant insists that the law of Nebraska provides that each mixed train shall carry two brakemen, and assigns as the single error relied upon the failure of the trial court so to hold. The said court refused to hold that the full crew statute applies to mixed trains, that is, trains carrying' both freight cars and passenger cars. "It is probable, though we do not decide, that the state may under the police power regulate the size of the train crews on all railroad trains, and that enactments of the legislature in that behalf are not violative of the federal constitution. It may be admitted, too, that the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 456) does not concern train crews. We are also inclined to agree with counsel that sections 5331, 5337 of the statutes (Comp. St. 1922), and indeed all of the provisions of the law, shoiild.be considered together for the purpose of arriving at the intention of the legislature. "But we are of the opinion that the district court made no mistake in deciding that the legislature did not undertake to prescribe the size of the crew of the mixed train.' It is true that the title of the legislative act evinces an intent to protect the lives and property of the traveling public, am^ railway employees generally, but, except in the case of freight trains on main lines carrying passengers, we find no language in ■ the title or act directly imposing on the roads any duty in the matter of the crews of mixed trains.. "The argument of the appellant is that the legislature surely did not intend that a railroad might attach a passenger car. to a string of 100 boxes and' flats, and by that simple expedient avoid the necessity of carrying a second b.rakeman ; that its intention was clearly to divide all trains into two classes, freight trains and passenger trains, with trains made up of both freight and passenger cars rated as in the freight train class. Appellant therefore calls attention to section 5337, which concludes with the words 'provided, main line local freight trains running one hundred miles or more and carrying passengers, . . . shall be provided with . ■'. . . three brakemen,' and declares that if, as is proper, this be construed in pari mn term with section 5331 of the statutes, which reads in its concluding lines, 'provided, mixed freight and passenger trains shall not be consid - ered passenger- trains,' the conclusion is un.escapable that the mixed train falls into the category of the freight train and must be governed accordingly. And the law is clear that the freight train must carry two brakemen. "This is persuasive, yet not sound, in our opinion. The last emoted words, 'provided, mixed freight and passenger trains shall not be considered . passenger trains,' though from an act </seg>

I have asked the rate department of the State Railway Commission to check the number of passenger trains stopping at Cambridge. It reports that three trains each way per day stop there. The total pas - senger revenues at Cambridge for the year 1927 were $13,955.68. If you wish to file a complaint with regard to the service, it should be taken up with the State "Railway Commission. Yours very truly, C. A. Soronsen, Attorney General, By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, August 14th, 1929 Hon. C. A. Randall, Nebraska State Railway Commission, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This department has carefully examined the informal complaint of Geo. Johnson v. Union Pacific R. R. Company, concerning which you recently submitted the question below stated. It appears that Wood River runs through complainant's farm, and that the Union Pacific railroad also runs across it, its track cross - ing the river on the farm, over a bridge about 180 feet long. The rail - road is fenced, but it brings the fences up to the ends of the. bridge, leaving a gap underneath, through which the stream flows and through which cattle and other live stock may go when the stream is at normal stage. There seems to be no contention that the fence, as now built, is defective in construction, or that there is danger that live stock will get on the railroad. The sole question is whether or not the railroad must fence across the stream or provide water gates or flood gates that will let the water flow through at times of high water, and automatically return to their position's when the floods recede. Wood River drains a large area and is sometimes subject to high stages of water. The statute, being sections 5396 and 5397, Compiled Statutes of 1922, does not definitely answer the question. An extended search has not revealed any authority exactly in point. The Supreme Court of this state has never had the question before it. </seg>
            <seg id="p501">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Section 5396, as originally enacted, required a railroaa company to construct fences suitable and amply sufficient to prevent stock from getting on the track. In 1883 the proviso was added which made it incumbent on the company to build a fence, when an adjoining land owner desired to enclose his land, the fence to be built, under the terms of the proviso, is, "lawful fence as described in this section", it is not clear as to whether or not the proviso enlarges the obligation to build, so as to include places not theretofore covered by the original statute. Notwithstanding the terms of the statute as amended it has been held by the Supreme Court that a company would not be Te - qmred to fence, when such fence would increase the hazards of operat - ing the railroad. Burnham v. C. B. &amp; Q., 83 Neb. 183. It seems improbable that the Legislature intended to require the construction of fences, where they are likely to be destroyed by floods It also seems improbable that if the Legislature intended to require flood gates, it would not have expressly so stated. It seems that no general rule can be laid down, but that each case must be determined on its own facts. While the subject is not free from doubt, it is the opinion of this department, that under the provisions of the statute, considering the character of the. stream and the flood conditions that sometimes occur, the company may not be required to construct a fence, or the fence with flood gates, as suggested. A list of authorities bearing more or less directly upon the subject, is herewith enclosed, but none of such authorities is exactly a preced - ent in the present case. Very truly yours, C. A.

            <seg id="p504">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT "Under date of December 16, 1928, Mr. A. J. Horton, Train - master of the Wymore Division, issued the following bulletin: 'In accordance with the Superintendent's notice, No. 2921 of December 15th, Nos. 135 and 136 will be operated as mixed runs between Nebraska City and Lincoln, effective' December 19th, 1928. On that day crew assignments will be reduced to one conductor and one brakeman on each turn. Conductors will arrange to take charge of the U. S. Mail.' "Since the effective date of the above quoted bulletin, these trains have, with a few exceptions, been operated with one brake - man, with not the slightest change in equipment or work per - formed. The trains have always been considered as local freights and as a matter of fact do exactly what any local freight train does, i. e., pick up and set out cars en route, do station switch - ing, load and unload L. C. L. freight and handle passengers and U. S. Mail. "We have made a check of work performed and I am attach - ing copy of this check for January 7th to January 21st inclusive. My information is that each train carries a caboose." Due to an extraordinary amount of work in connection with the I. C. C. Docket 17,000 cases; involving class rates, live stock rates and grain rates, it has been impossible to give it attention until now. This department inspected one of the cars in which passengers are carried on the trains referred to in your letter. It is a combination car, in one compartment of which express, baggage and mail are transported, and in the other of which passengers are carried. The seats are placed crosswise of the car, as in an ordinary passenger coach. . This department also wrote to Mr. W. F. Giles, Division Superin - tendent, C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., Wymore, Nebraska, asking what passen - ger equipment was employed on trains 135 and 136, operating between Lincoln and Nebraska City. Mr. Giles responded as- follows : "The only passenger equipment on these trains is combina - tion waycars which will seat about sixteen passengers." I note that in your letter you say that your information is that each train carries a caboose. The writer observed one of these trains at Syracuse not long since, and it did not carry a caboose. If your question had been asked prior to the decision in State ex rel. Spillman v. C. St. P. M. &amp; 0. Ry. Co., 115 Nebr. 306, we should have answered that the train should carry two brakemen. In fact, that is the answer which we gave when the question was asked, prior to the institution of the case above cited.

"The argument of the appellant is that the legislature surely did not intend that a railroad might attach a passenger car to a string of 100 boxes and flats, and iby that simple expedient avoid the necessity of carrying a second brakeman; that its in - tention was clearly to divide all trains' into two classes, freight trains and passenger trains, with trains made up of both freight and passenger cars rated as m the freight train class. Appel - lant therefore calls attention to section 5337, which concludes with the words 'provided, main line local freight trains running one hundred miles or more and carrying passengers . . . - shall be provided with ... three j brakemen,' and declares that if, as is proper, this be construed m pari materia with section 5331 of the statutes, which reads m its concluding lines, 'provided, mixed freight and passenger! trains shall not be con - sidered passenger trains,' the conclnsion is unescapable that the mixed tTain falls into the category of the freight train and must --.:,■■. • ■ .■ " • ' ) ■ • </seg>
            <seg id="p506">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT : be governed accordingly. And the law is clear that the freight trainjAst carry two brakemen. '*This is persuasive, yet not sound, in our opinion. The last quoted words, 'provided, mixed freight and passenger trains shall not be considered passenger trains,' though from an act considered and passed at the same session as the full crew act, is from an act relating to gasoline motor cars, and is probably of special and limited application in connection with the parti - cular conditions therein described. It is not sufficient to support appellant's contention. • "In the second place, even if the words under consider - ation were of general application, they can mean no more than they say. To say that mixed train's are not passenger trains is not to say that they are freight trains. Such a conclusion could only follow if there were a hard and fast provision in the law that all trains are either passenger trains or freight trains. No such provision exists. . "So, a custom has grown up of calling a train made up of both freight and passenger cars and carrying both passengers, and freight a 'mixed train.' 'Mixed train' has come to have de - finition accordingly. Legislators and everybody else recognize the term and its meaning. Because of its function, the way it naturally operates, the legislature has not seen fit to, prescribe the size and character, of its crew. Until it does the road cannot be required to furnish its mixed trains with another brakeman. "While mandamus will lie to compel a railroad company to. comply with the law as to the size of its train crew, it cannot be invoked to compel the road to provide a larger crew than the law plainly prescribes. "We are confirmed in our conclusion by the fact that the penalty section of the act provides no punishment in connec - tion with mixed trains. The penalty section is usually particular and specific, and the omission to mention mixed trains in such section argues that the legislature did not mean to include such trains in the regulation of the act. " It follows that the judgment of the district court is af - firmed." , ;. '.'.-: The only question for determination now, is whether or not the car in which passengers are carried is or is not a "passenger car", so as to convert the train from a freight train into a mixed train. An extensive examination of the authorities has been made. We cite a number of them below. In Arizona Eastern R. Co. v. State, (Ariz.), 242 Pac. Rep. 870, the court considered the difference between a freight train and a mixed train. In that instance, a combination baggage, mail, express </seg>
            <seg id="p507">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION and passenger car was carried. The stake of Arizona, upon which the case depended, reads as follows: All local freight trains, doing any switching, or un - loading any freight of whatever nature, shall be equipped with, and shall carry, a crew consisting of six persons, to-wit: One conductor, one engineer, one fireman, two brakemen, and one flagman. "2177. All trains other than those described in the preced - ing portions of this act, when operated outside of the yard limits, shall be equipped with, and shall carry, a crew consisting of not less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one flagman, and one brakeman." ! The case was tried upon a stipulation of facts, which is, in Dart as follows: "On the line of the Arizona Eastern Railroad Company be - tween Phoenix. and Hassayampa, train No. .30 runs Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday of each w|eek. It is composed of a locomotive, tender, and from one to 15 freight cars, one or two being loaded, and the balance empties to bring back loads from Hassayampa and intermediate points. This train when it goes down is No. 30 and when it comes back it is No. 29, and returns with from one to fifteen loads. Trains No. 30 and No. 29, being the same train, carry a combination baggage, mail, express, and passenger car. This car carries United States mail, express, passengers, and the baggage of the I passengers. Neither train No. 30 nor train No. 29 carries any caboose." In its discussion, the court said: "The legislature unfortunately did not define any of the classes of trains mentioned in the statute, and we have been unable to find any case defining these terms under an act similar to ours. In such circumstances we should assume the Legislature has adopted the popular significance of the words, on the theory that they are too well known to require definition. Now in or - dinary parlance a 'passenger train' I is one which carries pas - sengers, "their baggage, mail and express only, while a 'freight train* is one which carries freight alone, having a caboose at - tached for the use of the crew. A J local freight train' is one which stops at any siding along the line where there is freight to load and unload, be the quantity what it may, as differen - tiated from one which takes and leaves freight only at certain definite stops and generally called a {'through train'. Passenger trains are similarly subdivided. "If all trains were devoted eithsr exclusively to passenger or to freight service, our task would be simple, but it is frequent - ly true, and particularly in the sparsely settled Western country, '.■-...' ■' . </seg>
            <seg id="p508">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT that a branch or stub line may not have enough either of freight or passenger business to justify a separate. train of each charac - ter, and it is therefore a common and well-known practice for trains to be run combining the duties of both freight and passen - ger service. These are known in railroad language as 'mixed trains.' They partake of the nature of passenger trains, in that they have regular accommodations for passengers, baggage, express, and generally mail, arrive, make stops, depart on regular scheduled time at named stations, whether or not business awaits there, and are advertised to the world on the time cards of the railroad as doing these things. On the other hand ■ they are like local freight trains in that if any freight offers they carry it on the regular conditions imposed by freight trains, and do local switching of such freight cars as may be required by the service. (Cases cited) • "If our legislature had provided rules for only two classes of trains, freight and passenger, it might well be said that all trains must in some manner be placed in one category or the other; the choice being dictated by which class the particular train in question most nearly resembled. But in paragraph 2177 the lawmaking body recognized that there were other trains in railroad service than those which could be classified as either freight or passenger, and provided a rule governing trains which were not properly placed under either of the two main heads; and one class at least of trains, neither freight nor passenger, is the mixed train. "Does the train in question come within this last-named classification? An examination of the stipulation on record and quoted above' shows that it possessed every characteristic of the 'mixed train' above described. It carried passengers, bag - gage, express, and mail, but did not have a caboose. . It had seven regular stations between the termini of the line at which stops ■weTe made for the purpose of conducting passenger and mail business, whether there was any freight to be received or put off or not. All these stations were carried upon the regular time card of the railroad, and the train was designated on the time card and scheduled as a 'mixed train.' In addition thereto, the train carried from one to fifteen freight cars, and stopped for the purpose of receiving or delivering local freight whenever any was waiting at any of the stations along the line. "It seems to us that, if such a thing exists as a 'mixed train,' the one in question comes clearly within the description, In Holland v. St. Louis &amp; S. F 4 R. Co. (Mo.), 79 S. W. Rep. 508, the court used this language: "This is an action by plaintiff to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been received December 24, 1902, while </seg>

Under the foregoing authorities, it appears that the combination car is to be deemed a passenger car in considering the nature of the train. The only case which tends toward a contrary conclusion is Penn - sylvania R. R, Co. v. Public Service Commission, 67 Pa. Superior Court Reports, 569. The superior court is iiot the highest comfuX the Pennsylvania judicial organization. In that case, which also in - volved a Ml crew law, a combination haggkge and passenger car was held to be a baggage car. The case is not very clear and it seems to have been the thought of the judge %vho Wrote the opinion, that it could have been considered both a passenger and a baggage car. :-:;.] Ifl addition to the foregoing, we cite a number of cases which ■ bear indirectly upon this subject.

Sorensen, Attorney General, By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. ■■- . ■ • '■■ ~ I Lincoln, October 8th, 1929 Hugh Drake, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: Commissioner Randall has asked the following question: "Does chapter 15, section 4, Laws of Nebraska of 1927, reading in part as follows: *No motor transportation company shall operate in any manner as such, in the state of I Nebraska until there has </seg>
            <seg id="p510">TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT been filed with the Nebraska State Railway Commission a liability insurance policy or bond, which shall be approved By the Commission and be in form prescribed by the. Com - mission, in such sum and with such other terms and pro - visions as the Commission may deem necessary, adequately to protect the interest of the public, having due regard for the number of persons and amount of property affected.' authorize the filing of either an insurance policy or a bond by a motor transportation company?" The answer is that it does authorize the filing of either. While, from a rhetorical standpoint, the provision is not "what might be desired the meaning is clear. A disregard of the rules of grammar or rhetoric does not affect a statute if the meaning of the Legislature can be gathered from the language. The fact that some states require insurance policies while others require bonds to be furnished by common carriers by motor bus, must be taken into consideration. In the case of Packard v. Banton, 264 U. S. 140, decided in 1924, the court had before it a statute of the state of New York, requiring every person engaged in the business of carrying passengers, for hire, in any motor vehicle, except street cars and motor vehicles subject to the Public Service Commission law, upon any public street in a city of the first class, to file, with the State Tax Commission, either a personal bond with sureties, ■ a corporate surety bond, or a policy of insurance in a solvent and responsible company. Numerous cases may be found in which the courts have considered statutes permitting either an insurance policy or a bond to be filed. Many cases recognizing the difference between surety bonds and insurance policies are collected and cited in Blashfield Cyclopedia of Automobile Law, Volume 1, chapter 153, et seq. At the several conferences held by the E tate Railway Commission with the owners of motor vehicles used in common carrier service, there has always been a clear understanding that both kinds of obliga - tions were written ;. in fact, representatives of several companies have appeared and explained the differences between the two and quoted the respective charge for each. The 1929 Act, relating to taxi cabs, being chapter 147 and Laws of Nebraska, 1929, while subsequent to the bus law, shows that the difference between bonds and insurance policies covering the liability of owners of motor vehicles used in common carrier service is clearly understood and recognized in this state. The latter act provides that the owner of a taxi cab shall provide, "either a liability insurance </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION policy or a surety bond ■with an approved surety company as surety or negotiable and salable securities at jthe option of such person." It must be concluded that the difference between the two kinds of obligations is generally known and that it was in the minds of the leg - islators in passing the act. It is the opinion of this department that motor transportation companies may, at their option, furnish' either a bond or insurance policy. ■ Yours very truly. C. A. Sorensen, Attorney General, By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
