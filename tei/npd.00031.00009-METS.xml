            <seg id="p010">STATE OF NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION LINCOLN January 7, 1915 His Excellency, John H. Morehead, Governor of the State of Nebraska. Sir: In submitting to you the report of the Department of Public Instruction for the biennium ending January 7, 1915, and recommendations for the future, it is with the hope that the schools of the State of Nebraska may be improved thereby. During my second term of office as State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the rural schools of the state, under the wise supervision of the ninety-three county superintendents, have been doing most excellent work. The standard of the teaching force has been raised. The school buildings have been improved, the school equipment has been better selected, and the school grounds have been made more presentable. It is a pleasure to note the increased interest in the rural school problem. P'he town and city schools have been meeting their obligations e matter of high school education, giving the boys and girls nt training for the development of mind, body, and spirit. • the free high school law boys and girls from the rural schools been given a larger insight into life. The normal schools have been training teachers for the town and city schools, and a very few teachers for the rural schools. Like - wise, the university and the private and denominational schools have been training teachers for the city schools and a few for the rural schools. I 'he "rural school" teachers are being largely prepared by the d training high schools scattered all over the state. During ear 1913-1914 there were 176 normal training high schools with rollment of 3850 pupils doing the normal training work. From 176 normal training high schools there were graduated about young people, who will go out to instruct the rural school en. I No Educational Outlay of Money has done so much to raise standard of our rural schools as the money spent by the state he normal training high schools. For the past two years $125,000 appropriated by the state at large for this one purpose of train - rural school teachers. Two years of normal training under &gt;etent teachers have been given 3,850 pupils at a minimum per pupil of about $18 a school year of nine months. I heartily endorse normal training in high schools, and would suggest a more liberal allowance for these schools. ■The state normal schools should make a specialty of training lers for the normal training high schools, for the grades as well as for </seg>
            <seg id="p011">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 2 the instructors of the normal training classes. This would raise still higher the standard of our normal training high schools, which in turn would raise the standard of our rural schools. K would also suggest a Rural School Department in the State al Schools, for the purpose of training a few teachers for the schools. The boys and girls in our rural school districts should ren well prepared teachers and modern, well-equipped school- Irhe Commission for the Revision of the School Laws recommends &gt;tional county unit law, which I heartily endorse. But on my initiative I urge the adoption of a county unit school law for axation and supervision of the rural and village schools. The people of the state have optional laws for the consolidation of rural schools, rural high schools, county high schools, free high school tuition, and other beneficent measures, but the farming com - munities are not willing to pay the bills to insure efficient schools. One county of the state spends eight and two-thirds mills on the average for the rural schools, and twenty-three and two-thirds mills for the town schools. The rural communities expect city efficiency but are not willing to pay for the same. Another county spends on an average eleven and two-thirds mills for rural schools and thirty - five mills for the town schools. These are representative counties. When we get a larger unit of supervision and taxation, we shall secure a more efficient rural school system. Eo a mandatory county unit law, wisely administered, will give ief from our unsettled rural school conditions. This restlessness igitation in regard to rural school problems is propitious of things.- I am looking forward to the wise judgment of the legislature and the counsel of my successor to find the best &gt;n to this rural school problem, so these schools may reach the it plane of usefulness. The junior normal schools should be discontinued. They have served their purpose. In 1903, when they were established, they had a large attendance. But since that time we have established three state normal schools and one western agricultural school. Each of these institutions maintains a most excellent summer school at the expense of the state. A summer session is likewise maintained at the Uni - versity of Nebraska, at the state normal school at Peru, and at many of the private and denominational schools. For detailed information concerning attendance and cost of maintaining the junior normal schools during the past biennium, I refer you to the statistical tables found elsewhere in this report. The whole field of needed school legislation has been worked out carefully by the Commission for the Revision of the School Laws, appointed by Your Excellency. As a member of this Commission, it gives me great satisfaction to commend to you the results of our findings as set forth in the abridged report appended hereto. Es - pecially do I endorse the County Unit measure, additional informa- </seg>
            <seg id="p012">RECOMMENDED LEGISLATION 3 tion concerning which is found in the chapter devoted to the subject. From the study which I have made of the county unit system in other states, I believe it the best plan ever proposed for the solution of the rural school problem. Respectfully submitted, Jambs E. Delzell, State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

            <seg id="p025">16 ADDRESSES, LETTERS AND REPORTS WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO (Written at the request of the editor of the Nebraska State Journal, and published Ntvember SO, 1913) PThe onward rush of present day civilization and the rapid stride II classes of people to meet these demands have brought to the :ators of the world a problem so complex and intricate that it &gt;st appalls the most optimistic men and women who have given best of their lives to an attempted solution. I luring my thirty years of residence in Nebraska, my time has spent largely in the schoolroom, as student, teacher, or super - of schools. In that time, my preconceived ideas of schoolroom &gt;ds and subject matter have been modified as I have been ht face to face with the reality of the effect of these methods ubject matter on the lives of our boys and girls. The State Journal's question, "What I am Trying To Do" to remedy these conditions or solve this problem is a momentous one. In my own way I will attempt to answer the question briefly. My predecessors, Superintendents Jackson, Fowler, McBrien, Bishop, and Crabtree, each in turn strengthened the work and progressive recommendations of the one before. These state superintendents had associated with them men and women who were in sympathy with progressive uplift in educational affairs. So I have kept con - stantly in mind the one ideal of a true educational spirit, that a unity of purpose should exist in the great state system of schools for "all the children of all the people." With that thought in mind I have endeavored to assist in the unifying of the entire public school system. Eur system is a peculiar one. The law contemplates a one - 1, including the kindergarten, grades, high school, normal , and university — each a constituent part of the other — each in building up a highly educated, refined, cultured citizenship. I have found a tower of strength in the well balanced school and women of all ranks, from the rural school teacher on up jh to the head of our great university — all of them endeavoring list me in every possible way to solve the problem of giving ch child an equal opportunity to secure a training that will it the most efficient citizen possible. The village, town, and city schools are generally well super - vised. There is a reasonably well trained teaching force. Buildings are fairly well equipped. The many new school buildings are modern in respect to seating, heating, lighting, and ventilating. The course of study is generally good, but needs modification to comply with the modern idea that when a child has completed a high school </seg>
            <seg id="p026">17 course, it will at the same time have acquired some ability to cope with life and its problems. (Likewise, our normals and university have been waking up to :rn ideas and trying to fit men and women for present day life to inspire them with a desire to become a part of the "busy ' of workers rather than drones in this great commonwealth, private and denominational schools have arisen to the situation, fallen in line, and are working harmoniously with the state •Is. The parochial schools are rapidly seeing the value of a matized course of study, similar to the one used in our best c schools, and are raising their standards. The Free High School Law has been a means of increasing ma - terially the number of young people who annually complete a four year course above the eighth grade. The State Aid for Weak Dis - tricts given by the legislature for the assistance of the sparsely settled regions has added much to their resources for school purposes. The Increase of the Minimum Length of Term to four months, eight months, and nine months, will increase the efficiency of our schools. The Normal Training in our High Schools is raising the standard of our rural teaching force, as well making more effective the work done in the high schools. One of the latest tasks of the State Department of Education has been to put into active operation the "Shumway Agriculture Law." There are eighteen high schools operating under its pro - visions, some of them fully equipped, some of them getting a good start. Along with each agriculture high school are to be associated two rural schools, which will be equipped so as to give some ele - mentary instruction in agriculture, manual training, and home eco - nomics. The law contemplates a normal training class in each agriculture high school, which shall be trained especially for teaching in the rural schools. The associated rural schools will be the special observation schools for the normal trainers, and the benefits derived will react, not only to the associated rural school, but to the normal trainer and other rural schools with which he shall later become All of this constructive school legislation has exerted a great tendency toward the uplift of the pupils in the rural schools phys - ically, mentally, morally, and socially. The present special endeavor of the State Department of Educa - tion is to assist in finding a solution for bridging the gap between the rural schools and the high schools, so that boys and girls may remain at home and still secure ninth and tenth grade work in the rural schools. We sought to accomplish this through the last legisla - ture by means of a bill proposed by Representative Scott of Hamil - ton county, but the measure was not understood well enough to secure the co-operation of a sufficient number of legislators to secure its passage. Then Representative Reynolds of Red Willow county attempted to prepare a bill along the plan of county unit of taxation, </seg>
            <seg id="p027">18 but so intricate was the plan that it was thought best to take more time. So Representative Reynolds secured the adoption of a resolu - tion asking the Governor to appoint a committee, consisting of the State Superintendent and one member from each congressional district, to codify the school laws. The following were appointed to act with the state superintendent: Supt. N. M. Graham, Supt. Charles Arnot, Supt. Edith A. Lathrop, Supt. E. M. Cline, Supt. P. M. Whitehead, and Mr. William Ritchie. It is the desire of this committee that patrons, members of school boards, teachers, business and professional men of all classes, shall feel free to co - operate with them by making any suggestions that will aid them in working out a code which shall be harmonious and more adaptable to the needs of our great school system. It is my desire that in the more thickly settled portions of the state a tenth grade rural school shall be established in each township, so that the boys and girls of the rural communities may have an opportunity to be under home environments at least two years beyond the eighth grade; that they may be taught to think clearly and accurately; that they may be taught the pleasure and profit of tilling the soil and caring for domestic animals, of work with the hands, and care of the home; in short, that each boy and girl may be taught to love the home environment and be prepared to perform the duties of life in an intelligent, honest, happy way, and, when gifted by special talents, be equipped to step into the larger field as a worthy citizen — a builder of a better, grander commonwealth. James E. Delzell. CONCERNING NEBRASKA RURAL SCHOOLHOUSES (Written by James E. Delzeli. for The Christian Science Monitor, October 1913 To give each Nebraska child an opportunity to secure an efficient education has been one of the uppermost problems in the minds of the fathers and mothers since the time the earliest settlers located within the borders of this great state. The homes of the pioneers were humble ones. They were built out of hewn logs or were made from the prairie sod. The latter type was known as the "sod shanty on the claim." Though humble in appearance, they were comfortable, and made glad the hearts of many a family. </seg>

Too much time is spent in "book work" — "note book work" — in our schools to allow the children opportunity to do much serious thinking. The eyes of the average children are injured by too constant application to the printed page. This is caused by the constant demand of parents for the old time technical training for the boys and girls. This is a serious mistake. The teacher should be per - mitted to be a leader and guide for the child, not an "Egyptian taskmaster" that demands bricks without straw. Erhere is no royal road to an education. The teacher must i inspiration. The child must open his eyes to spiritual truths, teacher must see that the "burning bush" is planted so that hild cannot fail to see it as he opens his eyes. The mission of eacher is to arouse the slumbering child and encourage him t no longer of the "Lotus flower" and settle into a sleeper by ayside, but to awake and be a busy worker in the world. DEDICATORY ADDRESS (Given »t the dedication of the schoolhouae in District No. 107, Lancaster County, October, 1913; by James E. Delzell. The patrons of school district No. 107, Lancaster county, are to be congratulated on the erection of the best rural school building in the county. Your building is modern in general arrangement. The appearance from the road resembles an up-to-date dwelling. It is beautiful from an architectural standpoint. The lighting is of the latest design, being the uni-lateral system, so arranged that the light is direct and does not cast shadows on the work of the pupil. The heating is by means of a modern furnace in the basement, so planned that the assembly room is easily heated and ventilated. The seating represents the newest models. The sets and desks are adjustable to the size of the pupil, thus permitting each child to be comfortable. New Modem School House, District No. 107, Lancaster County </seg>
            <seg id="p032">ADDRESSES, LETTERS AND REPORTS 23 It has been said that a Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a James Garfield on the other constitutes a college. That may be so, but a modern school building like this one is the people's college, and from its room the next generation is looking for its men and gi to guide the destinies of the state. The state officers, county i, and leading professional men of today had their start in the school. The agricultural pursuits have a tendency to make rs and doers. The boy who is obliged to chase a pig and 1 it to submit to being kept in an enclosure, is able to take rt in the great field of life and to help chase the pachyderms one in his way. Boys and girls, your parents have gladly made the sacrifice that you might have this pleasait place in which to learn the "ele - mentals" of a school course. They are proud of you and are de - lighted to be present and to give you encouragement. In dedicating this building today, it is not as a monument to the dead but a memorial to the living, to you boys and girls of the present genera - tion, as well as the generation to come. This building should stand here for forty years without a single defacement, made intentionally. This building is yours. Keep it neat and clean; keep it free from marks and scratches. If you do this, it will be a reward in itself. Bt matters not, boys and girls, what occupation you intend to r, but it does matter how you work at the task that falls to lot. You must do your part in life's work and do it well. S William Hawley Smith tells this story on himself which is worth attention. He says that the effect of that fall's work which rise to this story, had more to do with his success in life than &gt;llege career. The subject of the story is "Willie Keeps the ine Going." Ene morning in the fall that Smith was sixteen years old his said to him, "Willie, take the eight horses, the four men, and d threshing machine, and make a tour in this county and the ing county. But, Willie, keep the machine going." This was a serious task for a boy of sixteen, with an outfit of men, part of whom were apt to be intoxicated some of the time. He said one morning that two of the men had been on a spree the night before. A hard day's work was before them. He had double duty to perform after dark as the last of a stack of grain was being threshed. Along with a sheaf of grain thrown up to be threashed was a piece of old carpet. He fed the bundle into the cylinder and "ker-chug," the machine stopped. Investigating, he found the "concave" broken into two pieces. After supper he sent a man twenty miles away to order a new "concave" by telegram from St. Louis. The least possible time in which this piece for the machine could be secured was two days. The words, "Willie, keep the the machine going" kept ringing in his ears, and a thought came to his mind. By means of a heavy oak plank sawed to the right length and hewed to the right width, and bolted to the broken con- </seg>

At four he arose as , and at sunrise the machine was going and continued to go for two days. A thousand bushels of grain were threshed. Willie had obeyed his stern father's order and the machine was kept going. Boys and girls, learn this lesson: Whatever you undertake to do that is right, keep the machine going. You cannot afford to begin a task and not complete it. Your lessons assigned at school must be completed. Each lesson learned will be a stepping stone for the Superintendent Gardner asked me to explain the requirements of an associated rural school as contemplated by the Shumway Act. An associated rural school is one selected by a county superintendent and the superintendent of a designated agricultural high school, or some state school giving an approved course in agriculture, home economics, and manual training. EThis school, on account of its excellent building and grounds, nterested patrons, its wide-awake boys and girls, its well trained able teacher, has been selected by County Superintendent W. H. dner and Principal Harry E. Bradford of the University School Agriculture, as one of the two associated rural schools in Lan - er county. The course of study and complete plan of work for agriculture, home economics, and manual training has not yet been fully agreed upon. Thus far a simple course in needle work will be one of the requirements of the home economics course, and another will be a simple course in cooking, practical enough to provide a warm lunch - eon at the noon hour. The manual training course will be arranged largely, for this year, with reference to the ability of the teacher to improvise work suitable for the pupils. The agricultural work will be simple in its nature. I am advising that each girl be assigned at home a small garden patch, and that she may be given proper instructions so that she may make a small garden that will be profitable as well as beautiful. This can be a summer's task for the girl. Each boy should be given a tract of ground, an acre or lew, ■Itivate. Let him put in corn, potatoes, or other crop in which interested. Then a contest in the fall, to determine which pupil tiow the best results, would encourage a friendly rivalry. EFFICIENCY IN NEBRASKA'S RURAL SCHOOLS (Written by Mr. H. B. Odeli from material furnished him by Supt. James E. Delaell, {or publica- tion in the Omaha Sunday Bee, November, 1913) Eighty-five thousand five hundred and five children of the farm in daily attendance in Nebraska rural schools last year in one-room schools. While the rural school has by no means ached the educational ideals over the entire state, the schools oraska rank high in their efficiency and economy of administra- </seg>
            <seg id="p034">25 tion. The cost per pupil for all schools in the state, including high schools, was but $38.73 in 1910. Data have not yet been completed showing the proportion of country pupils who attend and graduate from the high schools, but the percentage has been rapidly increasing since the passage of the free high school tuition law and there is a most encouraging increase in the number of eighth grade graduations from the rural schools. Krhe encouraging thing about the rural school is the practical of education; industrial training is already being incorporated me form in many of these schools and the annual exhibits at ducational department at the State Fair show that these children e farm are learning to use their hands as well as their brains. I 'he office of the state superintendent has recently tabulated concerning the colleges of the state, showing that there were 1 students enrolled in these institutions in 1911-12, with 1,175 ates from all courses. Probably not less than two-fifths, and ps one-half, of these students come from the farm homes of the and are carrying back to the countryside the inspiration and e of higher education. A GROUP OF EDUCATIONAL FACT KPhe total school population of the state is 376,477 1911 i 190,667 belong in the country; 133,337 of these are enrolled e rural schools and 85,505 were in daily attendance last year. ; are now in the state fifty-six three-year accredited schools and r our-year accredited schools. The secondary accredited schools in 1911-12 a total enrollment of 21,435 students, with 3,689 lates. From this group of graduates comes the tide of young e which swells at the doors of our universities and colleges, I Nebraska an enviable rank among other states for the number r college graduates. The decadence of the rural school, which is complained of so much in other states, has not yet seriously affected Nebraska. There is room for improvement, to be sure, all along the line, but the fact that the people appreciate the need of improvement spells achieve - ment and is assurance that the improvement will come, as it is com - ing notably in many districts. An instance of this progress is the Northport school, in Morrill county, out in the real pioneer country, which took first prize for rural school exhibit at the Nebraska fair in 1911. RURAL SCHOOL SURVEY One of the advance steps is the rural school survey, tentative plans for which are already outlined and in the hands of a committee of revision representing all educational interests of the state. This survey, which it is hoped to make a permanent part of the depart - mental work of the state superintendent's office until it shall have </seg>

This commission has been active in promoting educa - tional research, being directly connected with this office and the university, and has secured the enthusiastic support of county superin - tendents and teachers in every part of the state. VOCATIONAL WORK FOR BOYS AND GIRLS E'he vocational work for boys and girls has been correlated with Itate University and the general direction placed under contro e department of agricultural extension, of which Prof. C. W ey is the head. An entirely new and original plan has been ed which combines the best features of all the popular boys clubs, girls' sewing and cooking clubs, etc., and promises to give life and interest to the work among the children of the country This plan in brief proposes to organize a Nebraska boys' and girls' club in every country school district in the state. This club will choose a leader, who will naturally be the teacher during the term of school, and in vacation period some other person chosen for especial fitness and interest. The leader will act solely in a super - visory capacity, the club choosing its own officers. Programs for contests in corn growing, stock judging, cooking, sewing, canning fruits, etc., will be distributed from headquarters at Lincoln. The recreational side is not to be overlooked, and suggested games, sports, etc., will also be given regular publicity. !The local clubs are further federated into a county boys' and t club, which is under the leadership of the county superintend - each club being entitled to two delegates to the county organiza - , which, in turn, is entitled to two delegates to represent the ' clubs and two to represent the boys' clubs at the annual state ting, which is to be held at the state farm at Lincoln for a week day, the first meeting being held in May, 1913. Bt this state meeting a regular short course in agriculture and judging will be given under direction of the faculty of the ltural college and competitive judging will be done for prizes ermine who are the best boy judges of live stock in Nebraska. :ial course will also be given for the girls by the department of tic economy, with prizes for excellence.

The entire plan is unique and original and gives promise of new inspira - tion to the children and everyone with whom they come in contact. A MODEL TEACHERS' INSTITUTE It remains for Nebraska county superintendents to originate something entirely new in a teachers' institute. Superintendent L. R. Willis of Adams county has carried to successful conclusion a county institute for his teachers, lasting for an entire week, at which every phase of practical agriculture was presented by experts gathered from the Nebraska station and adjoining states. The valuable instruction imparted to these teachers enables them to understand how to ap - proach the problem of practical teaching of elementary agriculture, animal husbandry and home economics in the rural school. Elt is not difficult to foresee the time when all over Nebraska ar work will be an annual feature of the county institute and w mark will be established in the teaching of agriculture and i economics to the boys and girls of the farm.

HOW TO EFFECT THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE RURAL SCHOOLS (Address delivered before Seward County Teachers' Association, 1911 By James E. Delzell. The great question of today is: How can we merge all the small and seemingly useless businesses into a great and wonderful monopoly or corporation and yet not be hauled over the coals for graft or plain steal? And, this has not been confined to the com - mercial work alone. The churches of Canada have set us the pace of forming a great combine and are to be congratulated for the great good they will do when working together. So the question is, are we as teachers getting the small microbe of wanting to manipulate things so that we may get our share of good things, or are we wak - ing up to the fact that we are behind the times and should make a new start in the right direction and be among the great and the mighty of the land? There is strength in union, so said some old prophet, so we will proceed to the question at issue and give a few wandering thoughts about the needs of the schools of the out lying There has been a strong effort made by the state department of education for many years to make our schools so effective that there would be no possible excuse for any child in the state to say: </seg>
            <seg id="p038">29 "I have had no opportunity to become a well-rounded citizen. I lived so many miles from school that all I learned was to shoot geese, and they are now so few that I might as well be nobody as to attempt to live with the many who had a chance." Now, there are more geese hunters than you might imagine. So many that do not realize the real value of the schools as they now are; so many that look back to the good days of the "Leek and garlic of Egypt." The old days had some good things that it might be well to incorporate in our school course today. But many things ought to be eradicated from our present system and new and practical plans substituted. We would then think we were almost in the Mil - lenium of the schools of our times. But, alas, we were not willing to even help hold up the arms of our former Superintendents McBrien, Bishop, and Crabtree, the leaders of our present day educational system. There has never been such an effort put forth in all the history of the United States as has been put forth by the educational department of Nebraska. I am ready to say that we are in the dawn of the glorious day when the teacher with a missionary life will see many of the good things that are hardly thought of by the teacher who is teaching just to draw the salary. One of the problems confronting us is how we are going to manage to give each boy and girl of Nebraska a square deal. We hear "square deal" so often that we wonder whether or not there ever was such a thing when we were boys and girls in school, when we were "whipped" for this and "ferruled" for that and had our ears pulled for something else. But some are still clinging to the old idea that we must not change. The great need of a change in the management of the country school funds of this state is evident to all who have observed the useless expenditures of public money. Many of our schools have three and four pupils, and these are taught by a cheap teacher who seemingly has nothing else to do but to put in the time and draw a salary. It is not practical to pay a sufficient salary to secure a first class teacher for our small schools. Now is our system of con - trol of our country schools wrong? Is our law just what it ought to be? Will an opportunity to accept a change be looked into so as to consolidate our schools? It has not taken a very strong hold on the people of Nebraska. My idea is not an original one but was given to me by my father when I was less than twelve years of age. when his name was proposed for trustee of Jefferson township. Carroll county, Indiana. He said if he was selected for the trustee he would consolidate the schools of the township, lessening the Kr and increasing the efficiency of the schools; that he would :e a central school for the advanced grades. His idea was not d with much favor, and he did not even receive the nomina- But, there is a central school in that township today. Also hools have lessened by four and they pay good wages and the best of teachers. Now, I have pondered over that thought </seg>
            <seg id="p039">30 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT many times and have decided that my father had the right idea. My plan would be to organize our schools into the county or the township system and then arrange the number of the schools accord - ing to the amount of money, and the number of pupils in the divi - sion. The pupils living a distance from school could be transported at a small cost. The teachers could be apportioned so that each one would not have more than thirty pupils or more than three grades to the teacher. But, can we convince the people that we are not trying to make some form of a graft for the teacher? Well, we must keep talking consolidation and the rural high school until all believe as we do in regard to the matter. Let the farmer see that he will receive more help for his child by sending the child to a graded school and he will be sure to advocate the change. Nothing talks as the dollar, unless it is two dollars. There must be some one who is willing to sacrifice time and energy to get this great work done. The children are being poorly taught and there seems to be no way to overcome the trouble. In some schools we find so many children and so many grades that we do not get good work and we want a change of teachers. We expect to get a good teacher to care for them the next time, and then we are again mistaken. Then some old father in Israel will rise up in his wrath and say: "I used to 'learn' 60 on 'em to do just what was right and they k no wed lots when the term was closed." But those days are over and we are trying to teach the child instead of herding them in groups. I', suggest that we agitate this question until the farmers see they will save money in the long run; that they will add more e earning value of their children, and that they will take away ipportunity for so much vice in the schools. The commingling ipils on the way home from school is positively an evil that will oted out in the days when we get the ideal school. E These are a few of the thoughts that have come to me and I ture that we are ready in Nebraska to take a stand and help good work of consolidation along, merging, or any other title you may wish to apply. Only let us keep together in the matter let each one do what little he can find to do and there will be oubt but what we can improve the efficiency of our schools. Khave suggested county or township organization. I have also ted the "gossiping" method of advertising the uniting of the The transporting of pupils is no longer a theory but a demon - strated fact. The realization of the larger usefulness of the plan of transporting pupils for several miles is the reason you are being pun - ished at this time by this paper. I would suggest that each teacher and each one who is not a teacher really give the subject a few serious thoughts and talk to your friends and also to your enemies, if you have any, and get them interested in the matter until they are ready to put forth an effort in the right direction, as we see the case. </seg>
            <seg id="p040">ADDRESSES, LETTER AND REPORTS 31 Now, I do not for a moment wish you to think that consolida - tion will hold all your boys and girls in the country. You do not desire that. If you have a bright boy or girl who has talent and ability to fill some place of prominence in the world, you will not want them to be kept from filling the place in the world for which the all wise Creator endowed them. But what shall we do for our young people to fill them with a desire and an aspiration to follow the vocation of the father and mother? One of the greatest induce - ments is to have father and mother thoroughly contented with the lot they are filling; striving to make the mo &gt;le out of life in whatever place fortune may call them. Five per cent of humanity fill the professional calling. Ninety - five per cent belong to the industrial vocational life. Then, if that statement is true would it not be well to change our course of study in our schools from the non-vocational idea to the vocational idea? If one-fourth of the child's time was spent in preparation to live, and three-fourths to prepare a mind that can think clearly and concisely we would have a much more evenly balanced course and reach more of the great masses of people who would help enliven the world. Unity of purpose is necessary to accomplish much good. The quotation I gave in regard to those three towns seems to be what is needed to make more places stand out prominently in the and nation. You have an opportunity open to you to make a name for your town and community. Are you willing to make the needed effort? The Pied Piper of Hamlin town, to heap revenge on the people of that city who failed to keep a pledge with the piper, called all the children out of the town to more pleasant surroundings.

Ethe request of President R. W. McGinnis of the Nebraska ten's Association, a letter was sent out from the State De - nt to all town schools where the Milk Cow Train would stop </seg>
            <seg id="p041">32 Ere a demonstration, that the boys and girls of those schools have an opportunity to secure, at first hand, information experts in the dairy business. Having had several days' exper - on the Seed Corn Train, and knowing the advantages of the I was glad to send out these letters, knowing that the pupils receive much information. The idea of a "Special Train Exhibition" of any kind, I pre - sume, arose from the specialty made by the world renowned "show king," P. T. Barnum, who presented to America the wonders in the animal kingdom and the ability of men and women as trained gymnasts. This idea transferred to an advertising scheme to assist merchants and real estate men to present their "wares" to the world and to advertise their localities was so successful that the University saw an opportunity to do some extension dissemination of knowledge among the farmers with the "Seed Corn Train." This was such an efficient undertaking that the Dairy Train was sent out with one of the best dairy cows in the world and with up-to-date equip - ment for the dairy farm. As will be told by extracts from letters from superintendents and pupils, a deep impression was made upon the minds of those who had an opportunity to visit the exhibition. The lectures were very valuable to the students who are studying agriculture, and aided the farmers to understand better the value of the dairy cow, the beef cow, and the cow to be used for both pur - poses. Objective teaching has been the means of securing knowledge by all classes of people throughout the ages, and there is no better way of establishing the truth than by demonstrating it with the actual object at hand. I am giving here a few extracts from letters received from some of the schools where the Milk Cow Train stopped. Prin. G. S. Hoppel, Verdigre: "The dairy train was a benefit because it impressed us with the idea that a balanced ration is essential in the successful feeding of livestock, and further explained to us the best balanced ration obtainable here. It also showed the benefits to be derived from selec- tion and scientific breeding." Prin. C. A. Yeoman, El wood: "I know personally three farmers who are following some of the suggestions given them at the dairy train. They say it pays. That is what they all look at, 'Does it pay?' " Edna M. Furrow, ninth grade, Elwood: "The farmers received great benefit from this train, for they were told what and of a cow they should buy for dairy purposes, and what kind for beef, also what kind of feed to feed a cow if they wanted to get a great amount of milk. A good many farm - ers have decided to make silos so as not to waste any more food than necessary." Inez Snyder, eleventh grade, Elwood: "The stock train was beneficial in many ways. First, it showed the </seg>
            <seg id="p042">33 2 value of the different kinds of cows, the ones that were best for milk and butter profits, the ones best for beef, and those best for both. Second, it showed the best and most sanitary ways of making butter and taking care of cream. Third, we learned the best kind of milk pails to use, that is, the ones that are considered the most sanitary, and also one of the best separators to use." Gurda Nelson, tenth grade, Elwood: "There were to be seen approved types of dairy utensils, also dairy literature, and charts from which one might learn much of the dairy industry. Other things of benefit were the explanation of the Babcock tester, pointing out the value of keeping accur - ate records of the amounts by the aid of a spring balance and milk sheet, also methods of keeping the milk sanitary, which is very important." Supt. F. E. Weyer, Atkinson: "I am sure that the lec - tures, demonstrations, etc., did much good. One particular way in which it has helped is in leading both pupils and parents to read more along these lines, and to understand more clearly what they read." Prin. H. H. Ziemer, Farnam: "I should judge that from 250 to 300 people were reached by the lectures, and I do not doubt but what there were more. It seems to me that the things brought out by the demonstrators and others connected with the work are of vital importance to our farmers hereabouts. Our community is interested in work of this kind, as you will know when I tell you they have had three short courses the past three years, in spite of the crop shortage in this vicinity." tEMMETT Kitchen, Farnam schools: "In the exhibit car re samples of the various kinds of feed, as alfalfa, silage, ed hay and straw, and different kinds of grasses. I hope see the dairy train again." t Frank Preston, Farnam: "The lecturer said that you uld keep milk in a cold place, or take a wet sack and put r the can, also that you should milk the cow out for there &gt; more cream in the last than in the first of the milk." tRov Stilley, Farnam: "We were told how the people Nebraska were in need of dairy cattle. The eastern part the state is better supplied with dairy cattle than the item. The cows of foreign countries are fed on much her priced feed than the cattle of this country, but the pie of those countries make a profit on their cows." Lela Thrasher, Farnam: "The dairy cow is not a pretty cow, for the reason that she puts the food that she </seg>
            <seg id="p043">34 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT eats into milk and not into flesh, as does the beef cow. The beef cow is very pretty. The farmer need not buy pure bred cattle in order to get a good dairy cow, if he takes a little pains in selecting from a mixed stock." Don Beisner, Farnam: "We went through the car until we came to the dairying instruments: the churn, cream pans, Babcock tester, best kinds of milk pails, and a small windmill, showing the way to run water around milk to keep it sweet and make it raise thick cream." Lydia Hueftle, eighth grade, Eustis: "The lecturers on the dairy train told us that the Holstein cow gave twenty - five cans of milk in a month, and that for every dollar's worth of feed they fed her they received three dollars and eight cents; that the ordinary cow gave five cans of milk a month, and for every dollar's worth of feed they gave her they received one dollar and twenty-five cents." Edith Thrasher, eighth grade, Eustis: "They told us the way to tell a good cow is by the long chest, wide body, and large veins near the surface. An ordinary cow gives five cans of milk a month, and a Holstein cow gives about twenty-five cans of milk a month." E. Robert Frady, student Oakdale high school: "It has helped the agriculture class in its study of animals and their feeding. It has helped them to distinguish between a good milch cow and a poor one; a good steer for beef and a poor one. It has aided in the study of rations; what are good feeds and what are bad. The class now knows the use of a silo and the best to have. There are several stock raisers and farmers in this district who have seemed to get the same results from the lectures, as evidenced by their dairy and beef herds. The several silos in this community were put into more use this year than ever before. Cattle do not stand in mud to their knees about the water tank, and are given dry beds in warm sheds at night. Hogs have also been treated to warmer and drier sheds." Supt. C. O. Brown, Ravenna: "Our pupils were per - mitted to visit the train and hear the lectures. There can be no doubt that new and broader ideas were received by them. Any means thai convinces the rural population that the schools are doing real practical work will add to the support those same people will give to the educational system. We shall be glad to co-operate upon any similar occasion." f Mildred Cass, ninth grade, Ravenna: "These lectures owed the people what improvements were possible in milk and cream production if the proper kind of cows were used. It was shown that the average milk cow in Nebraska yields </seg>
            <seg id="p044">ADDRESSES, LET"n D REPORTS 35 jut 120 pounds of butter fat annually. The best cow on this train produces 870 pounds. It was thus shown that this cow was worth more than seven times as much to its owner as the average Nebraska milch cow, and the farmers were advised to adopt the Holstein, or other milk breeds o cattle, instead of the beef breeds now commonly kept on Nebraska farms." Ifhe interest aroused by the work of this train caused Supt - a Neff, of Phelps county to take up with the Beatrice Creamery &gt;any a plan whereby the Babcock milk tester might be used few of the schools of her county. The company replied in this "We are willing to do something along these lines, and contribute something to the placing or installing in schools of a tester for the purpose of educating the boys and girls of our schools in the use of the Babcock tester. • • • • I am writing this superintendent that we will contribute five test - ers. Perhaps she can get along with that number for Phelps county, but what they should have is one for each school, and a regular course of instruction. Much enthusiasm has been aroused in all communities where the Dairy Special Train stopped and instructors gave a series of lectures. This will add much to the material welfare of the state, because a higher standard of dairy cows will be secured for financial reasons. Likewise, a more profitable strain of beef cattle will be produced, for when farmers have a knowledge of better ways to advance their resources, they proceed at once to put that knowledge to practical use. The school people of Nebraska appreciate very much what the University School of Agriculture has done through extension work for the farmer boys and girls, and we hope the Nebraska Dairy - men's Association will send out another train this fall, covering points not reached last year, and wherever a demand is made, re - peating the demonstration in places heretofore visited. THE RELATION THAT ATHLETICS BEAR TO SCHOOL WORK Written »t the request of the editor of the World Herald, Omaha, and published N'ovember 1913) By James E. Delzell In early days time was given so that each child could develop cally and still have some time for moral and mental develop - , while present day educational ideas largely demand a "mental" th independent of moral and physical. An awakened public is demanding a return to a rational system of education that will us a higher type of citizenship. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">36 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Robert Louis Stevenson, in the following pedagogic stanza, gives a clear, concise outline of true life growth: 'Happy hearts and happy faces Happy play in grassy places, This is how in ancient ages Children grew to kings and sages.' The thought of many happy days spent along babbling brooks running through meadowland on into woodland has cheered the heart of many a weary lad and added to his ability to meet his duties cheerfully. On account of this freedom of early life in real out-of-doors games and sports, men are generally in thorough sym - pathy with clean athletics for our boys and girls. Bive natural result* come to the student that takes an active t interest in manly sports. First, he secures exercise of the major portion of his muscles, a necessary thing for the tearing down of wornout tissue, and giving a natural action to the organs of the body for the disposal of dead SECOND, physical growth is produced by this tearing down process which calls for a food supply for upkeep and growth. Third, mental alertness is developed — an added asset for good school work. For the pupil that has sufficient time to spend in approved athletics or systematic physical training, is, as a rule, a quick thinker. In all athletic drills there must be active attention, which will increase interest and enhance the chance of producing a keen mind. Kourth, discipline has been secured, which gives poise of and control of muscles brought into use during activity. There much value in an education that does not give thorough dis - ; of body and mind. Fifth, and the most important result of good athletics in our schools is self control. To become a helpful ctizen a pupil must have an opportunity in some way to secure exercise, which in some degree brings physical development, mental alertness, discipline, and ■elf control. Briefly, then, the relation that athletics bear to school work is to bring a properly arranged system of pleasant, helpful games into harmony with the regular academic school work, so as to round out our boys and girls into well developed citizens, physically, mentally, </seg>

Delzeli B'he first subject on the program was "The Old and the N on. James E. Delzeli, State Superintendent of Public Instruc - or Nebraska. Mr. Delzeli is a forceful speaker and his remarks well received. He said in part: The commercial course has come to stay. It has grown to such gigantic proportions that it muit be cared for the same as the normal school. Thirty years ago nearly all the normal schools of the United States were privately controlled and many of them stood out more prominently than the state schools. These have been surpassed Brmal schools by the state normals, and have developed into ercial schools and schools of private college rank. So the business schools will in time become extinct. Do not be fright- ened in the least, however, as the public is not awake to its op- portunity — only just one corner of the eye is opened. * * * ' * Omaha is to be congratulated on the establishment of a course of study adapted to the needs of more than seventy per cent of its school children, a course of study that really causes pupils to think and think clearly. Pupils in a true commercial course cannot long dilly-dally as so many do in our collegiate preparatory school co and why? In the collegiate preparatory course many boys and rirls are sent to school — they do not go — are sent, but in the practical, everyday, commercial course the boy and girl goes to school with a definite purpose in mind, and that is to learn how to transact business in a business-like way, so as to be one of the many needed in carrying on a business. The commercial course is, in fa "bread earning" course, and this is what many of us are obliged to do — earn our bread by the sweat of our brow. These schools have done more for the great mass of common people to place them in a position to live more economically, to have a certain respect for themselves as a mass than any one other vo - cational school. The commercial school has permeated every walk of life from the milkmaid, who trips by, to the king on his throne. The commercial school has in the past prepared our bookkeepers, penmen, stenographers, bankers, and, in fact, prepared partially at least a host of our business men and women to be accurate, neat.

            <seg id="p047">38 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS (A Prophecy) By James E. Delzell (Paper read before Superintendents and Principals Meeting, Lincoln. Nebraska, October, 1905 The State of Nebraska has been taking long strides during the last five years in the educational field. No other state in the Union has even attempted to keep pace. We have the largest and most interesting superintendents meeting, the greatest State Association of any state in the United States. We have the best set of men and women in the world striving to raise the standard of the civilization of the world. The con - tinued efforts in this direction have placed Nebraska at the head of the list of the states in having the least number of illiterates. Kebraska is known to have the least number of illiterates in ion to its population of any state in the Union. Our schools are dotted all over our prairies, on hill and in valley. In these are teachers of all grades, ability and preparation. This has led up to the desire of evening up the kind of instruction given to the pupils who are preparing to be teachers, by raising the min - imum standard of qualification. ■he patrons of the schools are continually asking our county itendents for the best available teachers. This has raised iges of the teachers in many of our schools, which in turn has aged our teachers to be better prepared, better qualified. A few of the causes that have started the educational forces to such energetic action, given at this time, will not be out of place. Chancellor Canfield on his entrance to the state "set a pace" to the educators of the state which indeed has been a "God-send" to our people. Erom a mere handful of students, when Chancellor Canfield the University has increased to a great city of students. We roud of our University, and justly proud. B»ot only the chancellor's genial ways, but his policy of creating terest in the university brought about the great growth of the university in the West. What was that policy to which we just referred? It was the "Accrediting to the university of the graduates of our high schools" that made a good record. ' Irhe pupils of the high schools were anxious to do such good that now over 150 schools have been placed on the accredited These schools have become feeders of the colleges of the state of the University. The normal schools of the state have ly increased in attendance since that time. PThe great increase in the attendance from the accredited schools the higher seats of learning necessitated the selection of some </seg>
            <seg id="p048">ADDRESSES, LETTERS AND REPORTS 39 one to inspect the schools of the "Accredited List" and those that were striving to be placed on that list. Professor James W. Crabtree was selected to fill the position. He visited all over the state. The schools of the state were brought in closer touch. The one thing that we all hoped for was partly inaugurated, the unifying of the schools of the state. Much was done. Prof. Crabtree being called to the head of the State Normal at Peru, Prof. T. M. Hodgman was selected to fill that place, which he has done, well. Thus we see what great good has come to our state and to the great Uni - versity by giving our boys and girls a better chance to receive a higher education and to raise the standard of "citizenship." We might proceed at length and tell of the many excellent things accomplished by our dearly beloved Chancellor Andrews and his most deserving co-laborers, but we must cease and call attention to the spirit of helpfulness instituted by Supt. W. K. Fowler and his co-worker Prof. J. L. McBrien. The amount of energy put forth in the past four years to encourage the teachers to rise to a higher plane in their profession has but begun to show forth the great good in store for the teachers of the state, and for the up - lifting of humanity. Our better institutes, our more progressive summer schools, at the university, state normals, junior normals, and private normals conducted by such able men as Prof. W. H. Clemmons, and Prof. J. M. Pile, and many other excellent men, has encouraged our legislators to arrange for a more strict certification of our teachers. This law implies more than the ordinary teacher thought at first, even more than the author of the law appreciated. It necessitates a preparation which the schools of the state as now equipped could not give until after the law had been in force many years. Supt. McBrien saw this and prepared a way out of the dilemma. One section of the law provides for normal training in the high schools of the state. Normal training in the high schools of Nebraska is a decidedly new feature in the school system of the state. But not such a new feature as you would think for; much is being done along that line in a quiet way at present. When this law is in full force our teachers in the high school will be a better trained force. Each high school teacher will be trained to some extent to give instruction along the line of teaching at least in the line of his or her special subjects. K)f the 900Q teachers in the state, you will find but a few that the requirements of the law. Many this summer, knowing this law was soon to go into effect, began to prepare for 1907. are our progressive teachers. They are the ones that are lg and are sure to succeed. PWith all respect to Pres. A. O. Thomas and Pres. J. W. Crab - in their work, where the very air is charged with the idea of ucting schools for "making" teachers, I will say that the "plants' 1 not vast enough to begin to furnish an adequate number of </seg>
            <seg id="p049">40 trained teachers for the grades of our high school districts, let alone to furnish teachers for all the rural schools. Khen what is the next best thing to do? Normal training in gh schools is the place to look for a trained teacher for the y schools, as our teacher-training schools are too small for ork. E'he idea of teaching would be continually before the high I pupil and would continually grow in the mind and the result e that teachers with the idea of teaching will be furnished. This will continue to grow and the pupil will look forward to a ■ training and will go on to our normal and university and le strong men and women in the profession of teaching. Let our high schools be in reality, as well as in name, a stepping stone to the normals, university and colleges of the state. EThen you would hold many in our schools that leave in the enth, eighth or ninth grades. The time is drawing nigh when h boy and girl will be only too glad to have the opportunity finish a high school course which will in part equip him for his ■tow I am not willing to materially change the course in the school at Lexington. But am willing to so change that the il work may be done more systematically than at the present. We will require full credit at the state university one-half year's work in the following subjects: Grammar, arithmetic, geo - graphy, reading, history and pedagogy. These will be carried one - half semester each, except history and pedagogy, which will be given at least one semester. This work should be done by a strong teacher, one who has had much experience and as much normal training as possible. Some observation work will be required in the grades of the schools. Help will be given the students as to the program and several little things that will be met with in the work of the first year's teaching. Keep the mind of the pupil on the work so that some definite idea will be developed. K'here is reason to believe if the high schools of twelve grades me preparatory work in teaching the pupil-teacher some school jement and the how to teac'a, there would be a demand for 1 teachers in the grades. Phe teachers in the grades being visited by the training class naturally be a little more careful in their work, for they know these student-teachers were critics even more severe the average superintendent. The county superintendent would have a chance to impress on these students some of his ideas of the work he desired to be done in the country schools. This plan would naturally encourage a few more boys to enter the work of teaching. If it did, would it not well pay the trial of normal training in the high schools? The boy needs to come in contact with a man teacher at least in a few </seg>
            <seg id="p050">ADDRESSES, LETTERS AND REPORTS 41 Our schools have done some of this normal work and it has been good for the schools of Dawson county. A better teaching force has been developed. From one-tenth to one-eighth of the graduates from the Lexington high school each year enter the schools of the county as teachers. How much it behooves us to help them, for they furnish the non-resident pupils for us in the high school So the more that is done to help these to get in mind the right idea of teaching, the better for the country schools, the city schools, the normals and university. I believe, that a few years of teaching in the high schools of Inal training" will double the attendance in Kearney and State Normals. Each move made by the State Superintendent ie past five years has been to increase the attendance at the ils. Thus a desire for more thorough work will be installed the schools of the state. Our high schools being fed by the outlying country districts will become feeders for the higher schools of learning of the state. Nor - mals and colleges will be a help to the university, the final school of instruction before entering that school of life, where we must stand or fall. The idea of a unit of the educational work would thus be form - ed in the state and we would not be worrying whether the university was excelling, or the primary school. Each part would feel that if any one part was being injured all was injured. We must work for a oneness of purpose. My entire strength has been to break down that "Middle Wall of Partition" between the masses and the classes. We cannot call ourselves civilized in the true sense if we bicker and back bite and become a dead weight instead of a help to the entire system of the state. The East pitted against the West, North Platte against South Platte, University against Normals and Private schools, one town school against another town school, one set of men against another, all tend to break up that unity that we in our better moments wish and desire, but in our freaky notions are ready to let all go to ruin to have our own little way. Let us drop all prejudices and hatred and lend a helping hand. If we cannot rule let us help the other fellow </seg>
            <seg id="p051">42 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS (A Fulfillment. (Response for Nebraska, Thursday, November 23, 1914, at the conference on Teacher Training for Rural Schools, LaSalle Hotel, Chicago, Illinois. By James E. Delzell The normal training in the high schools of Nebraska has been the means of raising the standard of the academic and professional training of the rural school teachers of Nebraska. In 1905 State Superintendent McBrien secured the enactment of a law that re - quired a teacher to have normal training in a summer school approved by the State Department of Education, or in a state normal school or high school of the state. He then laid the foundation for normal training in our high schools, which was established in 1907. I he first year there were 69 of these schools established. In :hool year 1913-14 there were 176 high schools approved by igh School Normal Training inspector, G. A. Gregory, for the ig of rural teachers. The enrollment was 3850, and we grad - 1,750 this year, thus giving us an added rural teaching force of trained young people especially fitted for teaching in the rural s of the state. ■he Nebraska educators and patrons of the rural schools are iastic over the efficiency of the work being done by these high 9 having normal training departments. The thirteen private and denominational schools, the four state normal schools and the State University certificated 456 with first grade certificates in 1912 and 562 in 1914. In 1912, 230 were cer - tificated with second grade certificates and 250 in 1914. Practically all of these schools at the present time are able to equip about 700 teachers with first and second grade certificates, furnishing the state 8 but 1 1-10 teacher for each of the town schools of the state, practically no trained teachers for rural schools. So to supply ■nore than 3,000 vacancies in our schools, we must have other the present state normal schools, university, and private and minational schools to meet the demand. Nebraska is well satisfied with the efficiency of the McBrien normal training system in our high schools. The course of study in these schools appeals to the young man or woman who desires to teach, and the spirit of doing things that have a definite end in view appeals to young folks. The boys and girls who enter the normal training course have a special impetus to do excellent work. I know of no one thing that has done so much to raise the standard of our high schools all over the state as the extablishment of the normal training work in these schools. With the raising of the standard of the high schools, it was necessary that all high school teachers have at least two years of academic and professional train - ing beyond the twelve year accredited high school. So in 1905 a law was passed to take effect in 1907; said law reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p052">ADDRESSES, LETTERS AND REPORTS 43 "No person shall be eligible to teach in the high school depart - ment of any high school district, or in the high school department of any city school district in the state who is not a graduate from a regular four year course of a college or university, or a graduate from the advanced course of a college, university or normal school in this state authorized by law to grant teachers' certificates, or who does not hold a professional state certificate obtained from the state superintendent on examination before him or a committee appointed by him as provided by law." Bhe State Department has made the following requirements ichers in the grades of these normal training high schools: S Beginning with school year 1914, all teachers in the grades have had normal training in high school and at least two years iching in addition thereto, or must be graduates from the itary course of a state normal and have had two years' teaching, graduate from the full course of a state normal or of a normal that gives practice teaching in the grades equivalent to that of e normal." Bhus we have started towards the goal of a better trained rural ng force. I he next move to meet the needs of the school children of i is to adopt a county unit of taxation and supervision of our schools. When this is done, with our present system of train - jral school teachers, these rural schools will be serving the • in an efficient manner. James E. Oelzki.i </seg>

If you have observed Arbor Day for so many years that you have plenty of trees on your school grounds, spend a part of the day in beautifying the grounds by means of shrubs, vines, and flowers — perennials and annuals. Ethe pupils are not familiar with the origin of Arbor Day and ation to the history of Nebraska, ask some pupil to prepare a sketch setting forth the main facts. The life of J. Sterling n will furnish material for an interesting paper. The eighteenth of May, a day commemorating the opening of the Hague Peace Conference in 1899, has been designated as Peace Day. Permit me to urge you to set aside an hour or two in your schools on that day to emphasize the great benefits that would accrue to the nations of the earth by the adoption of the policy of adjusting disagreements among nations without resort to war. The Peace Day bulletin, containing appropriate material for the observance of the 18th of May, compiled by Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews and published by the Federal Bureau of Education, may be obtained for about five cents apiece directly from the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D. C, or by addressing Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews, Secretary American School Peace League, 405 Marl - borough St., Boston, Mass.

The thought that men fought, bled, and died for their country, securely made a part of the nerve - fiber of a child, will arouse that love so thoroughly that nothing can eradicate the impress made in early life. Governor Morehead, Lieutenant Governor McKelvie, Secretary Wait, Auditor Howard, Treasurer George, Land Commissioner Beck - man, Attorney General Martin, and Superintendent Delzell have signed a request to mayors of cities, and chairmen of county boards to personally supervise a general collection to be taken in each community for the purpose of giving the survivors of the battle of Gettysburg an opportunity to meet again on that battlefield, to raise Old Glory over the great monument of Peace to be dedicated on the Fourth of July, 1913. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">48 The legislature of Nebraska appropriated only $4,000 to defray the expenses of the few who were supposed to be physically able to go. But it is now found that more than 250 survivors of that great battle will be on hand to go. I appeal to the school children of the state to lay aside all useless pleasures for one week and to send the money saved to dear old Comrade A. M. Trimble, Assistant Adjutant General, Lincoln, Nebraska, who will account for every cent received by him. Teachers, will you not join in this crusade for the purpose of demonstrating the loyalty of America's boys and girls? Arrange a special program for the occasion. Sing "America", and the "Star Spangled Banner." Then describe the great battle of Gettysburg. Tell how the Blues and the Grays mingled their blood on that memorable Fourth of July, and now after the lapse of fifty years the few that are left will meet to rejoice that America is one nation, Sparable and stands for "God, Home, and Native Land." Here reading of the Gettysburg speech will be an appropriate recog - &gt;n of Lincoln's great masterpiece of oratory in honor of the on's dead. After taking the collection and singing "Columbia, Gem of the Ocean", have the pupils raise the flag and salute it. i salute to the flag will inspire the young with a feeling of awe, middle aged with a feeling of dignity, and the veterans and their wives with a feeling of the deepest regard for the past, a feeling of Etism for the present, and a feeling of the highest hope that ca will still be safe in the hearts of her youthful citizenship the guiding hand and watchful eye of the Almighty.

            <seg id="p060">50 ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THIRTY-FIVE MILL LEVY June 3, 1913. Hon. James E. Delzell, Bntendent of Public Instruction n, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This office acknowledges receipt of your verbal request for an opinion as to the limit upon taxes to be voted in the coming annual meetings of the school districts of this state in June. You state that the recent legislature passed an act amending section 11540, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, by increasing the maximum of levy from twenty-five mills to thirty-five mills, but that this amend - ment did not carry with the emergency clause and does not become effective until July 17. You ask whether the voters may legally vote for the raising of an amount of money necessary for the main - tenance of the schools which shall equal thirty-five mills on the Under section 11540, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, the trustees prepare an estimate showing the amount of money required for the maintenance of schools during the coming school year, and the legal voters at the annual school meeting determine the amount of money required. The amount voted is certified by the district school board to the county clerk, and the county board makes the levy on the assessed value of the school district. In mak - ing this levy, the county board, under the present law, is limited to twenty-five mills on the dollar, and under the new law, which becomes effective July 17, the county board will be limited to thirty - five mills on the dollar. There is no limit upon the amount which the legal voters at the annual meeting may decide is necessary for school maintenance, other than the length of term decided upon under section 11545, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911. The limitation which section 11540 contains is one upon the county board in making the levy. The county board can not meet to make this levy until after the state board of equalization has met and equalized valuations. This meeting of the state board takes place on the third Monday of July, at which time the new section 11540 will be effective with its limitation of thirty-five mills. I take it that the voters at the annual meeting of a district may, if they see fit, vote for the raising of an amount of money which shall equal thirty-five mills, and that the county board, when in session in August, may levy an amount equal to thirty-five mills, because at that time the limit under the law will be thirty-five mills. You state that section 11545, dealing with the length of term, was amended by the recent legislature. If the districts desire to </seg>
            <seg id="p061">51 reciive state funds, it will, of course, be necessary for them to govtrn their action in fixing the length of term in conformity there - with.

REVIVAL OF SPELLING AND ORGANIZED PLAY November 13, 1913 Dear County Superintendents: There seems to be a necessity for revival along the line of true spelling in our schools. I do not necessarily urge the old-fashioned spelling school or prizes, but I would urge the use of some good secondary academic high school or grade school dictionary for the pupils of the school. I wish you would look after this matter at once. If you can take the time to report to me on this subject, I would appreciate it very much. I believe you can do some most excellent work along that line. Also, I wish that you would urge that there is a teacher on the playground during the play hours for the purpose of having organised play, as well as for increasing the opportunity of building up the morals of your pupils. One of the greatest lessons that a pupil will learn from a teacher is the lesson learned on the playground of fair play to all.

Better roads make life more pleasant I who have an opportunity to use them. Those who do not ie roads for traveling purposes have the benefit of a reduction cost of transportation. So a boost for good roads is a boost better civilization in Nebraska. Kwas invited to speak before the Nebraska State Automobile ttion at Grand Island, November 19, 1913, on the subject Roads as Taught in Our Public Schools." In that address I attention to Ravenel's "Road Primer for Children," one of the -five books recommended by the State Teachers' Reading Board in 1913 as suitable for rural school libraries and pupils' [ circle work. Hon. S. A. Searle of Omaha, president of the Omaha-Lincoln- Denver Transcontinental Route Association, offered a resolution that my recommendations on the good road problem be endorsed and that Ravenel's Road Primer for Children be approved as a textbook for the schools of Nebraska. The resolution was unanimously adopted. Ii conformity with this resolution the State Department of tion urges the school board of each district in the state to a copy of this most excellent road primer, to be placed in :hool library for the use of the pupils, the teacher, and the unity. There are fifteen chapters in the book. Fifteen general s for the entire school would give the pupils some valuable on how to make good roads, and an inspiration to boost in and out of season for better roads. Note the following chapter headings: I. What is a road, and what are its effects? II. Roads, their origin and extension. III. Location. IV. The map. V. The profile. VI. Grades. VII. Drainage. VIII. Cross-section IX. Bidding on and contracting for the work. X. Staking the work. XI. Construction. XII. Road maintenance XIII. Wide and narrow tires — high and low wheel XIV. Earth and wooden roads.

EWith the right kind of roads we could eliminate at least one - enth of our small school districts, which would net a total saving $374,637.42 on taxation, on the basis of a three months' school, the basis of a nine months' school there would be a decrease of es aggregating $1,123,902.26. The consolidation of the smaller ool districts would also tend to decrease the taxes. PThe hue and cry of many politicians is to reduce the expense ie state government, and to do this by decreasing the number junketing" trips. The entire cost of "junketing" trips of mem - bers of the State Department of Education in the past three years has not made an average cost to the state yearly of $210. And, I am sure, the better plans and methods brought back to the state have added to the uplift of the schools many fold in return. FThe great saving to the state should not come in niggardly petty savings to the detriment of the standing of the state in nation, but savings should come by giving more efficient service.

Lovejoy, al secretary of the National Child Labor Committee, stating Sunday, January 25, is Child Labor Day in the churches, the following Monday is suggested for its observance by the Is throughout the country. Nebraska probably stands among the states that have the least amount of child labor employment that is objectionable. How - ever, as a state or union grows older there always seems to be a tendency for children to be employed for a longer period of time and harder labor than they are able to stand or to develop physically as rapidly as they should. We do not believe that a due amount of proper work is injurious to a child. We do believe that a child should be employed a portion of its time in some labor that will be of advantage to it when it grows up. The labor a child does should not conflict with its regular school duties but should be of such a nature as to harmonize with its elementary education. !So, in making a request that you observe Child Labor Day in schools on January 26, it is for the purpose of properly placing ire the children in the school and the patrons of your community ideal child labor proposition.

February 3, 1914 My attention has been called to a new scheme of the Teachers' Bureau Department of Scarritt-Morrisville College of Morrisville. Missouri. We have many honorable teachers' bureaus in the United States that are doing a legitimate business, and we are pleased to have them keep school boards and superintendents informed in regard to eligible teachers for positions; but, to the best of my knowledge, a direct buying of positions through superintendents is not carried on by any of the reputable teachers' agencies with which I am acquainted. We give herewith the letter and form of contract received by a county superintendent and forwarded to this office. Publicity should be given to this so that no one will be inveigled into a trap unwittingly. I trust county superintendents will write the Scarritt-Morrisville College authorities expressing their disapproval of such a scheme to locate teachers in Nebraska. "Scarritt-Morrisville College Morrisville, Mo January 29, 1914 "My dear Sir U"I will give you $100 for ten minutes a week during the t four months. "I am offering you this position first in preference to any one else in your county, because you are more inter ested in getting good teachers to man your schools than any one else. You are the commander-in-chief, your teacher are the sub-officers in the educational army of your county You may be ever so expert and if your staff officers ar nefficient, your educational work will lag. "Now we are in the business of supplying efficient teachers, and we want you to keep us informed of the vacancies that occur in your county. We are not a com - mercial teachers' agency, but a department of a standard endowed college, hence, we have the full confidence of school authorities. The fact that you are our representative will not </seg>

You let us know where a vacancy is likely to occur and we will see to : t that a good teacher applies for the position. "Now for this information we will give you $100. But ou will recognize at once that we cannot sign an uncondi- tional contract. The best offer I have ever known from an agency is $5 for information that led to the placing of a teacher and, this is all we can afford to give. But to make you a special inducement I will pay you the $100 if we only locate ten teachers in your county, which surely we can do. "Remember your relation with us will be treated as strictly confidential. If you want more information about Scarritt-Morrisville College, look us up in any college direct - ory.

PEACE DAY March 30, 1914 My dear Superintendent or Principal Last year the eighteenth of May was observed as Peace Day in the schools of every state in the Union and in several of the European countries. Considerable prominence was given that day in the Special Day Programs issued by this department last fall. County and city superintendents were furnished these programs in sufficient numbers to supply all their teachers. The Bureau of Education at Wash - ington published in 1913 a bulletin, compiled by Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews, secretary of the American School Peace League, contain - ing suggestions for the appropriate observance of the day. If you desire a copy, address the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D. C, enclosing ten cents for a single copy, or $5.00 for 100 copies.

ARBOR AND BIRD DAY March 31, 1914 My dear Superintendent or Principal: As the results of the efforts of the Hon. .1. Sterling Morton, Arbor Day was celebrated in Nebraska as early as 1872. In 18*5 the state legislature set aside April 22, Morton's birthii.. rbor Day. On that day let us plant a tree, or two, or three. If you have observed Arbor Day for so many years that you have plerr trees on your grounds, spend a part of the day in beautifying the grounds by means of shrubs, vines, and flowers perennials and annuals. Make the day a general clean-up day for the school house and school grounds. Invite in the patrons of your school for an afternoon or an evening program. This is a good day to encourage the boys to start in to make their home and surroundings the rn and nicest in the neighborhood. If the pupils are not familiar with the origin of Arbor Day and its relation to the history of Nebraska, ask some pupil to prepare a short sketch setting forth the main facts. The life of J. Sterling Morton will furnish material for an interesting paper. You will find on page 99 of the Special Day Programs, furnished all teachers by this department last fall, an Arbor and Bird Day suggestive pro - gram. I wish to call attention also to the Good Roads m.i on page 101. Encourage the boys to become interested in good roads. The better roads we have, the better schools we have, for it is so much more convenient for pupils to attend school. If you do not have in your library a book on good roads, I suggest that procure a copy of Ravenel's Road Primer, published by the A. C. McClurg Company, Chicago.

You can secure a bulletin on "Good Roads Arbor Day" published by the United States Bureau of Education, by writing to your congressman. Arbor Day, spent as a special day for the beautifying of the school grounds and the homes, for learning about the birds, and for the encouragement of the good roads movement, will be one of the most valuable days of the year. Do not fail to put forth your best efforts for a pleasant and profitable day. Yours very truly, James E. Delzell State Superintendent. EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT AT THE STATE FAIR July 9, 1914 My dear Superintendent: Now that the school year is over you will know definitely what you can do in the way of an educational exhibit at the state fair, September 7-8-9-10-11. I am sending again an advance premium list and hope that if you have not already planned your exhibit and arranged for your space you will do so at once. We are to be in the new building this year, a picture of which you will find in the enclosed "Nebraska". The building is 300 feet on the north, 300 on the west, 366 on the south, and 90 on the east. There is a 36 foot balcony around the entire building. The legislature appro - priated $100,000, for its construction, and it will contain the agri - cultural and horticultural exhibits on the ground floor, and the better babies and educational exhibits in the balcony. It will be the most popular building on the grounds, and there could be no better place to "boost" for your schools, and to give your boys and girls the encouragement of having their work displayed before a big audience. If you have not already made your reservation, please do bo on the attached blank. If you have done so, please repeat the request at this time. All reservations should be in without fail by August 1. If there is a town in your county that would like to make an individual exhibit please see that we are notified. We shall appreciate all the publicity that you can give this matter.

While this hymn has never been cially designated as a national hymn, it is practically considered as h and used in the army and navy. It has been suggested by U. S. Commissioner of Education P. P.

All should stand while the music is being rendered, — a world wide custom when a national air is played or sung. I feel sure that the papers in your town will be glad to print the words, and possibly the music, of the hymn some day before the fourteenth, so that all teachers and children may have copies of it. It might also be interesting to have some one prepare a brief history of the writing of the hymn, for use in the papers or on the day of the celebration. Yours very sincerely. James E.

            <seg id="p085">REPORTS AND PAPERS GROWTH OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION By Jennie B. Adams, Secretary In connection with the study of the statistical table given else - where in this report showing the growth of the public schools of the state, it is interesting to note the growth of the State Department of Education. New laws have been enacted by each succeeding legislature and new duties imposed upon the state superintendent. Beginning with the admission of the state into the Union in 1867, and continuing unMl 1891, the state superintendent, with the aid of one assistant on part time, was able to take care of all of the work of the department. The assistant's principal work have been in connection with sending out school district supplies, all of which were until 1905 furnished by the State Department out of an appropriation made for that purpo- B3ne of the chief duties of the state superintendent during all nistrations has been to "decide disputed points of school law all such decisions shall be held to have the force of law until sed by the courts." All correspondence since 1872 has been rved in letter books on file in the state superintendent's office, etters were written in long hand until 18X5, and the first en letter is dated January 29, 1886, and signed by W. \V \\ E1891 State Superintendent Goudy was granted a deputy, and 3 a stenographer was added to the office force. The superin - t, deputy, assistant, and stenographer, took care of all the ional and clerical work of the department from 1893 to Ei 1903, during the administration of W. K. Fowler, the junior 1 law was enacted, placing upon the state superintendent the ;ement and supervision of summer terms of eight to ten each in from three to eight towns in various sections of the He was responsible for the organization and management of hools, the selection of the faculties, courses of study, and the g and keeping of permanent records of all grades earned by ore than 1000 students enrolled each year in the junior norn In 1905, under the administration of J. L. McBrien, the present y certification law was enacted, placing upon the state superin - nt the inauguration of a system far-reaching in its scope, r the law all examination questions are prepared, printed, and buted by the state superintendent to the county superintendents fficient quantities to supply all candidates for examination at our regular and one special examination dates and such other il dates as may be arranged. All answer papers in the nineteen </seg>
            <seg id="p086">74 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT county certificate subjects and the nine additional subjects for the general life certificates are returned to the state superintendent's office, there to be sorted into subjects, sent to the readers for grading, returned to the office to be sorted according to the applicant's number, grades recorded in the state superintendent's office on per - manent record cards for each applicant, and copies of all grades mailed to the county superintendents, to be by them reported to the candidates. This enormous task requried the services of four additional assistants on full time. So satisfactory have been the results that Nebraska's law, rules and regulations have been adopted with few modifications by a number of other states. In 1907 a free high school tuition law was enacted that was able to meet the test of the courts. The three previous laws had been declared unconstitutional. Under the present law all non - accredited high schools desiring to qualify for collecting tuition from non-resident pupils at the expense of the districts of their residence must make detailed reports to the state superintendent, covering number and qualifications of the teaching force, course of study, equipment, etc. On the basis of these reports, the recommendation of the county superintendent, and the state superintendent's personal knowledge of conditions, the state superintendent approves high school districts to collect tuition for one, two, three, or four years of work, according to the showing made. This approval involves a large amount of clerical work, as well as constructive work in the way of suggestions for the building up of courses of study, material equipment, and all that goes to develop children mentally, phys - ically, and morally. The same legislature provided for state aid for the weak districts of the state to enable them to hold at least five months of school. (Amendment later provided for seven months). The state superin - tendent, or some one from his office, visits typical state aid schools in various parts of the state and counsels with the county superin - tendent as how best to improve their conditions. Detailed state - ments of financial conditions are submitted by the county superin - tendents for every district asking for state aid, and this information serves as a basis for the apportionment of the funds appropriated each biennium by the legislature for the assistance of these financ - ially weak and sparsely settled districts. In 1907 the work of the state board of examiners appointed by the state superintendent was extended from a mere supervision of the examinations for the general life certificates, to an inspection of all institutions granting state certificates on the basis of certificates granted by the University of Nebraska and the State Normal Schools, and to the approval of the applications of all candidates for cer - tificates. By the consent and request of the Board of Regents of the university and the Board of Education of the state normal schools, those institutions were also inspected by the board of ex - aminers and the applications of their candidates for certificates </seg>
            <seg id="p087">GROWTH OF DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Eupon. By means of such inspection and approval, institu - state certificates of all kinds are based upon uniform require - and the state superintendent is the final court of appeal. It was during the same administration, 1905-1909, that the law went into effect providing for normal training in high schools. In the inauguration of this plan, courses of study were outlined, and rules and regulations framed for carrying on the work. Sixty-eight high schools put in the normal training course, and 1212 students signed the declaration to the effect that they intended to t An inspector for normal training was appointed, who visits all schools doing the work, suggesting, criticizing, and approving the work being done. He devotes all his time to field work, and an assistant in the office takes charge of the clerical work. The value of normal train - ing in preparing teachers for the rural schools has been so demonstrated that at the present time (October, 1914 ' over 180 high schools have qualified for the work and nearly 4,000 students are taking their first steps in professional training. I From 1907 until the present time the office force has numbered bout twelve, sometimes one more, sometimes one less, depending pon the amount of field and office work attempted. The administration of E. C. Bishop was distinguished by the special attention given to agricultural education and industrial train - ing. Boys' and girls' clubs were organized in nearly all counties of the state and records of individual work were kept by the department. Bulletins dealing with the raising of corn and potatoes (for the boys) and with cooking and sewing (for the girls) were sent out from time to time by the state department. The Nebraska Corn Book by E. C. Bishop has found a place in practically all agricultural libraries. The work grew to such proportions that during the joint administration of Superintendents Crabtree and Delzell it was turned over to the Extension Department of the School of Agriculture of the University of Nebraska. In 1911, under the administration of J. W. Crabtree, the city certification law was passed, making it necessary for teachers in city districts to conform to uniform examination and certification requirements. These examinations are conducted at the same time and in the same manner as the examinations for county and general state certificates, and in addition the certificates are issued by the state superintendent. The law providing for state aid to high schools giving approved courses in agriculture, manual training, and home economics, under qualified instructors, was passed in 1913 during the administration of James E. Delzell. Twenty high schools have been designated under the provisions of that act and are doing excellent work. An inspector passes upon the quality of the work done and suggests ways and means for its improvement. L During the same administration special attention has been given rural school problem, and one person has devoted his or her </seg>
            <seg id="p088">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT time to that phase of the work. In connection with this problem considerable thought has been given to the county unit as the unit for school supervision, as set forth elsewhere in this report. Pro - vision has also been made for work upon the proposed revision of the school code, a much needed piece of legislation. I'he legislature of 1913 also amended the County High School making the establishment of a county high school mandatory unties that do not have within their borders a twelfth grade school accredited to the State University. Under this amend - seven county high schools have been established, making with limball County high school, a total of eight county high schools eration in 1914.

The Shumway bill was supposed to carry with it an appropriation of $75,000, but this was reduced to $15,000, which will assist in starting the agricultural high schools in accordance with the new law. Of the 109 school bills presented at the last legislature only thirteen Senate Files and forty-eight House Rolls were public school measures, the remaining twelve Senate Files and thirty-six House Rolls having reference to university or normal schools, school lands and funds, metropolitan schools, and special school interests. Of the twenty recommendations made by the state superin - tendent, bills were introduced covering all but four. S. F. 147 was a school library measure, which failed of passage. The Shum - way Bill, S. F. 27, the agricultural high school bill, covered Items 2 and 20, concerning a rural school inspector and subsidies for agriculture, domestic science, and manual training. S. F. 150, providing for approval of schoolhouse plans, was in line with Item No. 3, but it was lost through a misunderstanding. H. R. 582, relative to county superintendents' office help and office supplies, was defeated. H. R. 68 and H. R. 263 raising school district levy to thirty-five mills as recommended by Item No. 6, were passed. The recommendations concerning state aid for weak districts, schools in sparsely settled districts, and districts more than four miles square, were covered by S. F. 124, the state aid law. The city institute plans cover the recommendation concerning attendance of teachers at institutes and associations. The compulsory education bill, H. R. 661, failed of passage, as did H. R. 244, providing for the teaching of music. The county high school law, H. R. 517, pro - vides for nine months' free high school attendance for all pupils in a county high school, in counties that do not already have within their borders a twelve grade high school accredited to the state university. H. R. 329, enacted into law, permits districts to vote sufficient bonds, and the Potts bill looks toward the more equitable distribution of corporation taxes.

Bessey, University of Nebraska I.t the invitation of J. H. Miller a meeting was held in the In hotel on December 15, 1898, at which there were present :ellor MacLean, Professors Sherman and Bessey, Superintendent r, Principal Waterhouse and Mr. Crabtres. The matter had thought out pretty carefully by Mr. Miller and on this account is made chairman of the meeting. It was decided to have no 1 constitution, but the following rules were adopted, and in respects they are the same as those we have now: B Published in the Nebraska State Journal, November 9, 1913, with illowing introduction: Lincoln, Nebraska, Nov. 5 To the Editor of The State Journal: It does not seem possible that the eighty or more members of the School - masters club should need a public defender in this state, but it may be of interest to citizens to know something of the work and history of the club. Three years ago Dean Charles E. Bessey was asked by the club to prepare a brief history of the work up to tha time. This historical sketch was read at the next meeting and I present it herewith to the public. At my reques Dean Bessey adds a paragraph on the general conduct o this organization since he wrote the history. H. K. Wolfe, President Nebraska Schoolmasters Club. </seg>

The Nebraska Schoolmasters club is a social and profes - sional union. ■ Names of candidates for membership may be submitted to ecutive committee, who may bring the names before the club meeting. KNew members may be elected at any meeting. One blank shall be construed to postpone the election. No discussion wed as to non-fitness of candidates. 4. The officers shall be president and secretary, and these shall constitute the executive committee. The officers shall be elected at the last meeting of the school year and shall serve until the election of their successors. 5. The details of each succeeding meeting shall be determined by a majority vote at the preceding meeting. B. The expenses of the club shall be borne equally by all mem - )f the club and any member who fails to pay his part of such se before the next meeting thereby forfeits his membership. it members who give twenty-four hours' notice to the secretary be assessed but one-third the usual fee. 7. Subject to the approval of the executive committee any member may at his own expense of two-thirds the usual fee bring with him guests to the meeting. 8. The club by a two-third's vote may invite guests to any future meeting, in emergency cases the executive may extend an invitation to any prominent educator or public man who may be temporarily in the city. Executives may in their discretion call a meeting of the club to entertain distinguished gues' Chancellor MacLean was insistent in his determination that the club should be very informal and in order to emphasize it sat during a considerable portion of the meeting with his feet on the table around which the members gathered. No more emphatic action could have been taken by such a man as Chancellor MacLean. It was arranged to have a special meeting for the election of additional members and this occurred on the 27th of December. Superintendents Reed, Dinsmore, Pearse and Jackson, Professors Beattie, Ward, Hill and Luckey and President Perry were elected to membership. About this time it was decided that Mr. Miller should continue to be president of the club and Mr. Crabtree secretary. Barly in January of 1899 the first regular meeting was held at the membership was limited to twenty-five. In this meeting ractice of having a dinner in connection with the paper and sions was inaugurated. I ["he second meeting occurred early in March and the practice i had been inaugurated at the beginning of dropping all titles emphasized. Everybody was plain Mister. There were no ellors, presidents, professors, superintendents, etc. At the last ng of the year Mr. Miller was elected president for the year dng and Superintendents Stephens and Bodwell, Professors </seg>
            <seg id="p104">90 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT Powers and Pattison and President Kerr were added to the mem - bership. kWith the first meeting in the fall some changes had taken place le membership, Chancellor McLean having accepted the presi - y of the University of Iowa. During this year of 1899-1900 meetings were held regularly and some additions were made to the membership. It was determined that at the last meeting of the year early in May the wives of the members should be invited. At this last meeting it was recom - mended that Chancellor-elect Andrews should be elected to mem - bership which was done by acclamation. During the year 1900-1901 Superintendent Pearse was the president, and about this time the former practice of dropping all titles began to weaken and we find members addressed as "president" or "chancellor" or "professor." Here, too, the custom of having one meeting of the year in Omaha was inaugurated. Ei these earlier years the number of meetings each year was not the number usually running from five to six or seven, but there gradual growth of the feeling that the meetings should be I to a smaller number. At the last meeting of the year President Kerr of Bellevue college was made president of the club for the ensuing year. En the years that follow minor changes were made in the rules ier to avoid friction which had arisen on account of the ease which any candidate might be blackballed and the membership was gradually raised from twenty-five to a much larger number. te time a little more than ten years ago, balloting by mail was luced, but after a trial of a year or so it was abandoned. IPhere was one period during which it was very difficult for one to be elected to membership, the common experience being every name presented was met with enough negative votes to t election. This threatened to bring about much bad feeling, gradually this died out with the growing feeling of good fellow - which arose in the club. In looking over the minutes one is struck by the feeling that the club has not at any time given way to any money making pro - jects. Year by year at the annual examination of the treasurer's accounts it has been found that the club treasury contained but very few dollars, scarcely more than enough to cover postage before the next dues were collected. This lack of money in the treasury doubtless has had much to do in all these years with keeping the principal objects of the club constantly in mind. We have never been tempted to indulge in any luxuries at the expense of the treasury, since the treasury could not meet any considerable demand upon it. ■t is pleasant to record that the club departed from its usual J program at its Omaha meeting in March, 1904, when it be - known that Superintendent Pearse was to leave Omaha to ac - the superintendency of the schools of Milwaukee.

Thus about six of the papers deal with the formal divisions of educational work — the grades, the high school and the college, and in these papers the problems connected with these divisions were discussed. About the same number of papers gave attention to the pupils, including the studies proper for the pupils, the question of the development of the child, his play, his health and his morals. A few papers were devoted to the me - chanical and the business side of educational work and a few also to general topics which included cultural and historical matters. To the historian of these earlier years there comes the sugges - tion that perhaps the club has given too little attention to questions of actual teaching and presentation. But one paper, that upon English Teaching, took up this matter in all the years of the club's existence. It is notable also that but two papers dealt directly with college problems and but two to grade school problems. These observations may suggest the lines along which papers might well be prepared in the club in the near future. </seg>

Hunter IPaper given at the Nebraska Schoolmasters Club, May 1, 1914.] The change now going on in the educational thinking of this country may easily, I think, be termed a revolution. It has com - pletely changed the goal of our public school system. It has brought numerous activities never before dreamed of as educational into our school organization. It has already largely changed the method of working in many of our larger city schools. It has rallied almost all classes of people to the active support of the schools as the agent through which the community is to work out its ideals and guar - antee to itself perpetuity and prosperity. It is fast changing the school from kindergarten through university in aim, organization, operation and results from the aristocracy of "scholarship" to the democracy of manhood and efficiency. A thorough discussion of this movement would show the intro - duction of many new activities and could be contained only in many volumes. It would include a discussion of Manual Training, Do - mestic Science, Domestic Art, Industrial Training of Boys and Girls, Trade Schools, Technical High Schools, Prevocational Schools, Con - tinuation Schools, Evening Schools, Social and Recreational Centers, Playgrounds, Physical Training, Moral and Civic Training, School Gardens, Medical Inspection, Open Air Schools, Schools for De - fectives, Junior or Intermediate Schools, the "Six and Six Plan," and many others. I shall attempt to discuss only two of these activities — the two which in my opinion most vitally concern Ne - braska Schools, because they can be used in most town schools of our state. I mean Public Recreation and Vocational Guidance. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">NEW EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT •9 The playground and the social center are distinctly recent as factors in our educational scheme, but they come as the result of sound thinking and a recognition of social conditions that have be - come universal in our large towns and cities. One of the most char - acteristic developments of our modern social life, one which marks the transition of our American civilization from infancy, at least to early youth is the sensational way in which the very natural and universal desire for recreation is gratified. Everywhere there is the tendency to obtain the normal amount of pleasure and amusement necessary to physical development and mental activity in the most vivid and highly sensational forms. Hence, the motion picture show, the cheap theatre, the penny arcade, the medical museum, and the modern dance craze. These are not amusements of groups who are social outcasts, but the means taken by the masses to gratify their natural longing for recreation. Which of our Nebraska towns does not have at least one motion picture house? Which one is not teach- 6 its young people the Tango, and the Maxixe in some public e hall? And which of us of this audience is satisfied with the ch social of our childhood days as the chief source of our own ation? A few months ago, a Nebraska gentleman driving over-land in his motor car passed through a village of some 500 people in which he had been some twenty years before. It was evening as he passed through the town as it was when he had been there on the previous visit. The town had grown little in that length of time. But in appearance and the tendencies of its people, there seemed to be great difference. This evening the single street was ablaze with light. The store fronts were brilliantly lighted, electric street lights gave almost an urban illumination and two or three motion picture houses, their cheap automatic pianos clanging noisily, seemed to be doing a flourishing business. A dance hall in a room above a store, seemed to have a large attendance. Apparently the whole popula - tion of the village had taken to the streets and the down town amusement places. The scene twenty years before was vastly different. Then the only street illuminations were two or three kerosene lamps set on posts at the street corners. There were no attractive store fronts and no places of amusement in operation. The population was largely at home as attested by the gleams of light from many firesides. This is a picture of almost any Nebraska village of the present time on any week-day evening. The char - acteristic feature is the way in which the people, especially the young, satisfy their desire for recreation. But the rural community and small village scarcely offers so tragic a situation with reference to young people and their amusement as does the large town and city. A questionaire sent out to our own school children here in Lincoln, discloses the fact that approxi - mately 88% of them attend motion picture shows and that over 7,000 of them attend every week. </seg>
            <seg id="p114">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT A recent recreational survey of Detroit, made by the Play - ground and* Recreation Association of America gives the total at - tendance at motion picture shows of that city, as two and one-half times the population each week. The same association in its survey of Kansas City, gives the following startling figures: Kind of Theatre Attendance Moving picture houses 449,064 Vaudeville theatres 31,000 Melodrama theatres 21,000 Burlesque theatres 22,000 Drama ("legitimate") theatres 31,000 Penny arcades 47,600 Medical museums 5,824 POPULATION OF KANSAS CITY — 248,000 I Exhibitions: Totals Moving picture 81 Vaudeville 3 Melodrama 2 Burlesque 2 ■ Drama ("legitimate") 3 Penny arcades 6 Medical museums 2 99 Dance Halls: ■ General public 10 Club 18 Fraternal order 20 Dancing academies 5 53 Games: Pool and billiards 194 L Bowling alleys 6 Shooting galleries 13 213 The weekly attendance at the exhibits alone is shown by the dlowing table: Average Weekly </seg>
            <seg id="p115">NEW EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT The weekly dance hall attendance was as follows Ioon. The amusement lust of Kansas City wit I = is, according to these figures, satisfied only by the attend 2,000 people weekly at places of commercialized amusement, esults shown by this survey are, in their general trend and con - ns, in no wise different from those in any large urban com - y. The same rampant desire, and the same exploitation of it immercial gain is apparent everywhere. Khe effect upon the ideals and the character of our future ship can be only too evident to those who are close and &lt; itchers. The results can be foretold in accordance with three r fairly definite conclusions and principles: A. Commercialized amusement is appealing largely to those whose characters and ideals are in the formative stage. Kl. Impressions which are fixed in a pleasurable environment n a recreational way, much more easily become habits of action those which come through less pleasurable environment and by ater degree of coercion. KVery frequently the worst impressions and ideals are strong - d most persistent because most vivid and sensational. K. The positively bad element enters very largely into both vironment and the means of entertainment. The Kansas City Survey shows 70', of the 450,000 average weekly attendance at the picture shows are under twenty-five and are under fifteen years of age. Here, then, in these show houses, dance halls, and pool rooms are to be found the ideal the making, of our future citizenship. Here these young people take their lessons in character, form their standards, and mold their thinking. For this is recreation; it is in accordance with natural im - pulses; the environment and the sensation are stimulative and i ant; these impressions, therefore, according to all the decrees of the psychologist, will be permanent and lasting and will shape themselves into habits of action. Listen to this from a thirteen year old girl of the seventh grade in answer to one of the questions of the Lincoln questionaire on motion pictures: " Moving pictures show you what life is after marriage and teach you what to expect." And this from a fifth grade boy of ten: "I like war, burglary, and murder pictures best." Another boy in the same grade says: "In moving picture shows you see men robbing houses and you learn how to rob Average W.

Many of the Lincoln children speak of films showing people dying, drinking beer, fooling the policeman, robbing houses, snatching pocket books, fighting, stabbing with knives, gamb - ing, beating prisoners, and robbing safes. The Kansas City Survey says that motion picture films on exhibition in that city portray murder, suicide, extreme brutality, crime exalted, and immorally suggestive situations. Some shows present such subjects as: Elsie Siegal Murder Mystery," "James Boys in Missouri," "Henry Clay Beattie Murder," featuring pictures of Beulah Binford. The dance halls and penny arcades are even more harmful. A recent Lincoln investigator told me personally that there could be found no worse travesty on recreation, and no worse influence in the young life of the city than Lincoln's public dance halls. Khe Kansas City Survey shows the Nickelodeon and penny s of that city to be a very harmful moral influence. In one of ■nusement parks, long rows of penny arcades are displayed, are topped by lurid signs and questionable pictures outside ire patronage. Some of these subjects are as follows: Sign— TRAGEDY OF THE BALL ROOM E Picture — A man holding the lifeless body &lt; f a woman in his Contents of the Machine — Man takes a woman to a ball. be ball he gives his attention to another woman.

            <seg id="p117">NEW EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT The type of thinking stimulated by recreation of this sort could not be lofty and pure, nor lead to sound character and right habits of action. To my mind, the future of our communities, whether urban or rural; municipal, state or national, depends upon nothing so much as upon the efficiency and the pure motives and high standards of their citizenship. We cannot insure our permanent prosperity merely by increasing our bank clearings, bringing factories to our towns and erecting sky-scrapers. Our real capital is in our civic efficiency, the standard of living and thinking of our masses. "Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey; where wealth accumu - lates and men decay." After all do resources or people make a community prosperous and a good place to live? Is the future of a city to be guaranteed by the amount of its bank clearings, the height of its sky scrapers, or the number of its industries, so much as by the standard of its citizenship? How much would the stock of the most prosperous banking house or business corporation in Nebraska be worth on the dollar if such institution were located in Mexico City or Constanti - nople or Teheran? Yet the resources of Mexico, Turkey and Persia are boundless. The difference is in the standard of living, in the kind of people who constitute the population and in their civilization and advancement. The community then or people which thinks only of its material resources as the basis of its civilization is not states - men-like and far sighted. Ket how can we gather grapes of thorns or figs of this' allow our commercial amusement houses to inspire our ideals i do it with this sort of dross and waste of the gutter, how can ild a truly great and permanent civilization? There is one other phase of this situation which should be touched upon at least slightly. Many children and young people do not avail themselves of the types of commercialized recreation of which I have just been speaking. They either become loafers or immediate criminals. The Kansas City report again presents this question in its statement of the observation of 1,528 children seen on a certain day on an area nine blocks long by six blocks wide. Of these 1,528 children, 71 c ', were in streets and alleys and 50', were doing nothing, merely loafing. Here is one of the sources of Juvenile Delinquency. Nobody's idle hands appeal to Satan so strongly as those of the child. In our own town I have knowledge of a most tragic case, months ago, an automobile driven at terrific speed dashed into an ornamental fountain in one of our streets. The machine contained two men, two women and the driver. The driver was killed and two of the others badly injured. Although fictitious names were given in court, I have knowledge that these two young men were youths from our German Russian settlement, less than twenty years of age. The women were questionable characters. These young men were giving themselves over to viciousness, were developing themselves </seg>
            <seg id="p118">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT into criminals, were taking their lessons in citizenship from Lincoln's scum element, because Lincoln all these years has failed to provide wholesome and legitimate recreation for the young of this community of 6,000 foreign-born citizens of the German-Russian settlement. These young people have tremendous possibilities and could be developed into a splendid asset to the town instead of becoming a liability by swamping their young lives in criminality. So the problem of "no recreation" is as vital as that of com - mercialized recreation. Both together and the fact that S5 f ' c of all crimes are committed between the hours of six and eleven p. m. force us to the conclusion that the leisure time problem is worthy of the best thought, effort and leadership which our communities have to offer. That a constructive program should be worked out for the con - trol of the amusement instinct can no longer be doubted. The very nature of the tendency is educational. The school system must recog - nize the principle and take definite measures to meet the emergency. So powerful a force must not be left to men who use it only for their own profit. Much has already been done in some of our most progressive centers of population. Gary has worked out a system which makes its schools the most attractive recreational agencies in the community. Milwaukee has established social center organiza - tions in its foreign districts and regions of crowded population which make the school a radiating center for righteous civic influence in the progress of the city. New York and Chicago, through wonderful playground and social center systems, are accomplishing the same thing. Last year in a Michigan city the size of Lincoln, the Board of Education leased a motion picture house for one week and put on display during that time only films of an educational nature. The attendance in one week in this motion picture house reached 10,000, most of it school children. In our own state, the movement is Bng significant proportions. For several years Fremont, and field have maintained and equipped playgrounds in connection he public schools. Numerous other towns are being added con - y. Instances of country schools accomplishing the same thing ilso come to my notice. Rnasmuch as I am more familiar with Lincoln than other towns ebraska, I may be able to use better what we are attempting to illustrate the direction it seems to me this movement should Six playgrounds have been in operation during the past il year. They have been supervised by members of the regular teaching corps who have devoted part of their time to regular class Sn work and part to the playground. The supervisor has been recess (of which all buildings have two fifteen-minute periods) in the evening from dismissal of school until 5:30 and at one of playgrounds on Saturday. The total attendance and cost of rating the same is shown by the following table; </seg>
            <seg id="p119">NEW EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT Playground Attendance and Cost, 1913-14 of the school year by funds raised by an exhibition given jointly by the Mothers' Clubs and the schools in June, 1913. In March, 1914, a general festival and school exhibition was given at the City Auditorium. The attendance during the four days totaled 18,000, with gross receipts of $5,492.52. The net re - ceipts, $4,574.49, have been prorated to the various schools as a permanent playground fund. Apparatus costing $2,435.19 is being installed at present. The remainder of this fund will be expended as soon as the contemplated additions are made to the playground space at several of the schools. In the near future motion picture machines will be in operation in connection with the high school auditorium and the auditorium of the new Bancroft School. No school house should be built in Lincoln in the future which has not an auditorium in which the people of the community can gather for recreational and instruc - tional purposes, nor without a gymnasium and abundant playground room and equipment, which can be made to contribute in a con - structive way to the control of the amusement of our young people to the up-building of a sound and wholesome ideal in citizenship. Khe other phase of this new educational movement, vocational ice, viewed from one angle, is as old as civilization but as an liate problem for the public schools, it is distinctly new. The ability to think abstractly in a virile and definite way may be an important aim in education. But the ability and tendency to think about one's work in life and the ambition for a sucot career at some honorable and profitable profession or occupation is much more important. For often young people drift into their life work without having any intelligent knowledge of what the various occupations and professions have to offer them and without having done any serious thinking about this all-important subject. It is a part of the business of the school system to see that this knowledge is at least to some extent brought to the child during the formative stage of his character and in the beginning of his independent think - ing. It is not necessary at all that the child decide what he wants to be very early in life although in many cases that would be best.

Most of all, he should have the habit of thinking seriously on the subject, for so important a thing should not be left to chance and circum - stance to decide. As Director Jesse B. Davis of Grand Rapids, Michigan, puts it: "Vocational guidance aims to direct the thought and growth of the pupil along the line of preparation for life's work. The plan is intended to give the pupil an opportunity to study the elements of character that give success in life, and by a careful self analysis to compare his own abilities and opportunities with success - ful men and women of the past. By broadening his vision of the world's work, and applying his own aptitudes and tastes to the field of endeavor that he may best be able to serve, it is attempted to stir the student's ambition and to give a purpose to all his future efforts. Having chosen even a tentative goal his progress has direc - tion. In the later study of moral and social ethics he has a view - point that makes the result both practical and effective. As vocational guidance is interpreted thus far in the Lincoln schools, I take it to mean for the pupils an increased (1) knowledge of their vocational possibilities and opportunities through (a) care - fully selected reading and statistics concerning the vocations, and those employed in them, (b) first hand observation, (c) advice from leading men who give talks and lectures to them. (2) Ambition through (a) carefully selected biographical reading, (b) the example of successful men of their own acquaintance, (c) the inspiration and help of the teacher, (d) their own expression of it in school activities, e their own visible accomplishments in typical industrial occupations provided by the schools, (e. g. cabinet making, printing, etc.) (3) Train - ing through (a) self analysis, (b) consciousness of power, (c) practice in activities requiring skill, (d) an enlarged vision. (4) Probability of right selection of a vocation. (5) Assistance in proper placement in a suitable vocation. The significance of this movement should be well understood by the teacher. It should be a part of her professional and peda - gogical thought. She should be so saturated with it as a part of her ambition that her very contact with the child's mind will give oppor - tunity for the accomplishment of the results it seeks. Her personal influence will be very great in the attainment of results or the lack of them. The means the teacher uses will be as varied as she is a resourceful and progressive worker. They will consist largely of these types of activity however: (1) Use of the reading list. (2) Work of the Junior Civic and Industrial League. (3) Adaptation of ordinary school subject matter. Irhe success of vocational guidance as a school activity depends large degree upon the enthusiasm of the teacher in undertaking ■r knowledge of the conditions bringing it into the schools, its &gt;ses, and the means to be employed. A new element in pro - nal preparation is immediately injected into the work of the </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEW EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT teacher, namely a study of the materials to be used in vocational guidance. For this, the teacher should have the same credit and professional promotion as for the same type of work along other lines.

Ordinary school room material can be made a very effective means in accomplishing the purpose in vocational guidance, long since the principal of one of our schools visited in another city, happening in upon an English class in the sixth grade of a pre - vocational school. The work was in oral composition. A twelve year old boy told the following story as his composition, upon the theme, "The First Money I Ever Earned." It illustrated how effec - tively childish thinking can be directed if the school purpose is right and the teachers skillful. The First Money I Ever Earned About seven years ago my father was an engineer on the C. R. I. &amp; P. R. R. One night in a fierce snow storm, he ran his train into another train and killed a man. They said that he was not guilty because it was not his fault. He felt so bad and it worried him so that he gave up his job. He bought a ten acre tract of land, and we raised vegetables. In about two years my father died. Mother says he died of a broken heart. After this my mother, my little sister and I worked very hard to riase the vegetables and my biggest brother peddled them. One evening mother called us all to her and told us we would have to give up the place, and do some - thing else as we could not go to school ana keep up the place. She said we had best sell and go down town. We bought a home and mother takes in washing and we children help her all we can. gLast fall at fair time, as I was passing the fair grounds, I thought »e if I asked the manager for a job he would give me one. So 1. He told me to come the next morning. I worked all week made ten dollars. That was the first money I ever earned. ught these clothes and my books, and gave the little I had left other. I want to grow up to be an honest man. I want to earn enough to make me comfortable but not enough to make me unhappy. I would like to be an engineer, but every time I mention it mother cries so, I do not know for sure what I will do. </seg>
            <seg id="p122">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT The daily paragraph also can be used very effectively as a means of vocational guidance. Discussion of various topics related to local civics and to the various vocations studied should lead to the use of the written paragraph as a means to the formulation and definite expression of- the pupil's own ideas, ambitions, or ideals upon the subject discussed. This does not in the least detract from the value of the paragraph as a training in English composition. It really adds much to its effectiveness, in that it provides a very vital type of motivation. The following examples represent some begin - nings that were made last year in the use of the daily paragraph. They are seventh and eighth grade work.

Therefore, I am trying to prepare for that now. is what everybody should aim for — that one may know how to ; his business.

I would like to specialize in law at a large University, then get in with an older lawyer who has had a great deal of experience and can tell me several things I do not know. Then I would like to be a good politician and have something to do with the government. Then I would like to be a good orator and go on tours of the world speaking. I would like to become a governor or a senator or something like My Vocation I have in mind two vocations that I would like to follow when I am older. When I graduate from the high school I would like to be prepared to be a teacher of penmanship for a couple of years in order to make money enough to go through the University. Then I would like to take a course in the University afterward to enable me to write books after I am through. I have always wanted to write books and I am planning to do it if I can but I may not be able to carry out the things I have planned. My Probable Vocation I have taken this problem into much consideration, but to me it is quite a puzzle to decide. I might possibly be a furniture dealer, a printer, or a salesman. The reason for my first choice is because my father is at present engaged in that line of business. First of all, I shall be, I hope, an honest, good business man. </seg>
            <seg id="p123">My Vocation I would like very much to be a civil engineer. I choose this because it is a profitable bsuiness. I would try to do my work well so that no accidents would be caused by my work. I would also be honest about my work and not cheat my employer. What I Want to be When I Become a Woman ESfhen I become a woman I want to be a housewife. I have two reasons. First, I love a home and enjoy caring for one. d, I enjoy children and also like to care for them.

Love is better than :hes. The "long" composition also should be made an instrument in vocational guidance. Various phases of the vocational subjects studied by the class as a whole or specially assigned topics of study by certain individuals should be made the basis for at least one composition each semester for clpsses in the seventh and eighth grades. Members of grade eighth A should prepare their last "Ions" composition upon "Choosing a Vocation." In other subjects, Geo - graphy, Arithmetic and History this vital motivation should be Ei in much the same way as in composition. Any topic in subjects, the purpose of which is not specifically that of drill nrial knowledge, should always be connected up with life. In many of Lincoln's commercial and manufacturing establish - ments exist numerous opportunities for young men who are properly equipped, honest, industrious, and ambitious. The business men who manage these establishments are always seeking those who can make their services valuable. It should be one of the purposes of our schools to help such young men — who find it necessary to begin some useful industrial pursuit early in life— or before entering a University career — to locate themselves in places where there is opportunity for further education and advancement. There should be also included in this purpose the desire to serve the community by giving to its business interests efficient and well trained workers. All of these young men should of course continue their attendance at school, working after school hours and on Saturdays. Some who cannot, should attend evening schools. All of them should be pos - sessed of certain elements of character and fundamental essentials in training which make their success and advancement sure and which make them valuable to their employer. Kccordingly, within the membership of each club in the Junior and Industrial League there will be a list of members who have a definite efficiency test and who have given complete evi. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">dence of reliability of character. From this list members will be recommended from time to time for such positions as the business and professional men of the town have to offer. This shall be known as the efficiency list. Any boy who shows himself eligible to member - ship will be given a certificate stating that he has given evidence that he possesses the qualifications and equipment which make for good citizenship and success in business or professional life. The qualifications for eligibility to this list shall be: tAn age of fourteen years. Good character. As shown by: a. Truthfulness. b. Obedience. c. Industry. d. Good habits. Note: No boy shall be eligible who smokes (or drinks). If a boy has been a smoker he shall show by a year's abstinence from this habit that he has permanently given it up. f Knowledge of Lincoln and Nebraska As shown by: His ability to pass with a standing of 90% a test given upon Lincoln and Nebraska. Ability to write a good business letter of one ordinary page in legible hand without error in spelling. 5. Ability to express himself — In courteous yet concise and business like terms to his employer or business associates. 6. Ability to perform — The four fundamental operations and simple fractions in arithmetic, with speed and accuracy. The business men of Lincoln who are interested are asked by means of the following letter to co-operate in this attempt to serve both the young men of the city and their employers: Mr.J S.. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. S As an employer of young men you are undoubtedly interested in securing those who can make themselves of most value to you and your business or profession. It is likewise of vital interest not only to such young men themselves but to the city as a whole that they be able to give the best possible service to their employers and pre - pare themselves for continued efficiency and promotion. Ei'here are in our schools many young men who must begin work early age.

S. Whitten. Fred M. Hunter. What I have given concerning recreation and vocational guidance as vocational factors seems to me to be typical of the trend of the new movement in our state. I believe the suggestions that are con - tained herein are practical. In our own town they are only in the experimental stage, however, and a definite conclusion concerning them can be made only after the activities have been carried on for some time and careful observations made as to their results. They seem to me, however, not only in Lincoln, but in each town in the state where such activities have been begun, been founded upon right principles and to have come as a result of very apparent needs. Careful thought on the part of school people and intelligent direction of public sentiment and an awakening of the various com - munities to the significance of these things is necessary if our school systems during this transition period are to serve most efficiently. To this end each school man and each school woman should feel the greatness of the responsibility and should be dedicated with an in - increasing devotion to the service of our young people and the race. REPORT OF CONDITIONS IN WEAK SCHOOL DISTRICTS By Anna V. Day, Assistant State Superintendent It is part of the policy of the state superintendent to keep as closely in touch with the schools which receive state aid as it is pos - sible. To this end as many of them as could be reached were visited by Assistant State Superintendent Anna V. Day during the falls of 1912 and 1913. She makes the following report of her trips: December 9, 1912. Dundy County. Benkleman give; visitors a most hearty recep - tion, sometimes at least. In not many towns would the station </seg>
            <seg id="p126">agent leave his work at two o'clock in the morning to escort a stranger to the hotel and call the landlord, as this one did. The courtesy was fully appreciated. About nine o'clock the morning following this experience, Miss Lorna White, the superintendent, called for me with her car and driver and we started on our day's trip. Lunch was tucked down in the bottom of the car, so there was no uncertainty as to where we should eat at noon. The driver would drive with one hand and eat with the other while the passengers would hold to their hats with one hand and eat with the other. The first part of the trip was a fifteen mile drive north to district 14, taught by Miss Sours. Ten E 1 1 were present in the little schoolhouse, three boys and seven The house was nice and clean and the pupils were doing what could with the Ward reading. Nearly all of them ride or drive 100I, from one to three m'les. Five miles more brought us to District 70. This is a state aid district and is taught by Miss Esther Jerrsberp. The schoolhouse is new and since the district is so poor they are gttting along with just as little as possible in the way of supplies. The pupils own their own books. For many years preceding the school in this district has been held in a vacant dwelling house which stands about half a mile from the site of the present building. The present build - ing is the merest makeshift for a school house. Parents in eastern districts would think they were greatly abused if they had to send their children to such a poorly prepared school. Another long run brought us to No. 23 where Mrs. Metcalf teaches, for the second year. The schoolhouse was in poor repair, there were no shades and there were several window panes out, but in spite of that the room was exceedingly hot and close. The nine pupils who were present were doing the best they could under these unfavorable circumstances. One felt tempted to break a panel or two out of the door, and several more panes from the window, to supply a little much needed ventilation. Miss Lola Artist in District 21 was +he last teacher visited. Four pupils were in attendance here. The house was in poor repair, and as there was no coal house the supply of coal was piled on the floor in the back of the room, — effective, but not especially attrac - ts e. This is Miss Artist's first term of school, but she feels that it is part of her duty to do all she can for her district outside of the four walls of her school room. A Christmas tree was in the process of preparation, and to us who are accustomed to a fine evergreen tree, it was a pathetic sight. Evergreens are an unknown thing on those western plains. In fac;, any kind of a tree is rare. They had found something that would answer however, and were wrapping the branches with pink tissue paper to make it look more festive. That was the only tree planned for the neighborhood, I believe, and it will doubtless carry with it as much joy as the finest fir tree used this season. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">Dundy County is feeling particularly well this fall, since they have had this year the best crops they have ever had. One of the very profitable crops is brjom corn and it is an interesting sight to see the stalks prepared for market. Elitchcock County. Leaving Superintendent Anderson's office his good old reliable horse, in a threatening snow storm, we five miles to a little school taught by Arthur Walters, a young man who has taken normal training at the Trenton high school, and whose father owns nearly all the land in the vicinity of the school house. He drives out from Trenton daily and gives the five littl? people under his care the best attention possible. The school lacks decidedly in equipment but since each child gets the teacher's full attention during all of every recitation period, they make very satisfactory progress. The next call was at Beverly where Miss Phelps is teaching her first year. She says that it will also be her last as she has ambitions toward becoming a reader on the lyceum platform. She informed the superintendent that she would like to assassinate him with a hat pin for bringing company, but as one of her chief faults is said to be talking too much the remark was not taken seriously. The school building is good and there are sixteen pupils in attendance. If the teacher talked less and the pupils more the results would be more desirable. IPhe next echool was one of the largest in the county, taught lies Galleger. The pupils were out at recess when we drove id were evidently not much in the habit of receiving company, school house was new, but Supt. Anderson said that was all as able to get. The beet field Russians who live in the district see no reason for making it modern. Another four mile drive over roads that sorely tried the strength of old Mack, and the nerves of his passengers, because it was so drifted full of tumble weeds and slippery, and we reached the largest rural school in the county, district No. 6. To get from the road into the school grounds your horse must jump the irrigating ditch. This is rather an unusual performance but not so bad if the horse knows how and you know what to expect. Our horse jumped in a finished manner and we drove up to the house in good condition. The younger pupils had been dismissed. We had met part of them in the road and asked them if school was out. One self possessed boy replied "Not fer de big kids," so we found the "big kids" in pos - session. This is Miss Miller's first term and it argued well for her success that she is able to keep that big school of forty-seven pupils in the little school room, let alone keeping them quiet and busy. The floor was badly littered with paper but that was explained when one youngster threw some waste paper which he wished to dispose of </seg>
            <seg id="p128">at it. The intention was good but the aim was poor, hence the littered floor. Miss Miller and her school made an excellent impres- I fancy Mack was no more sorry than his passengers when he finally turned into the nice smooth level road for the last pull into Culbertson. It had been a hard day and he had well-earned the rest in the warm stable. Chase County Supt. Leocia Fletcher has- been Mrs. Seward now for about a year, and now when Mr. Seward is at liberty she visits in a touring car and her husband does the driving. Beats taking care of her own horse and driving, all hollow. The first school visited was taught by Miss Salyer. Twenty-seven pupils were in attendance, and it was a school which would compare favorably with one in any section of the country. Miss Salyer heard a class in Ward reading for us. The school grounds were in good condition and the basket - ball goals argued well for the way in which they spent their inter - missions. The next school was taught by Miss Verna Cooney. Miss Cooney has had few advantages herself, but when she decided to teach she went at her examinations systematically and finished them in better shape than many a high school graduate. She is teaching her home school and has three pupils. To prove that they are accomplishing something, the little girl who started to school in September can now recognize 253 words. More than most children learn in the whole first year. Miss Cooney is very ready at working out devices for teaching the children and the school room is full of evidences of her ingenuity. To teach numbers there is a little •tore wh^re numerous articles can be sold at prices given on the black-board, and paid for in card-board money, which duplicates our silver coins. The children love to play store and are learning how to make change in a way which they will never forget. From this school we went to Imperial where we spent the night. Mrs. Seward has a nice office in the new court house and is very proud of it, as most county superintendents would be. Early the next morning we were again on the way. The first visit wu made to Miss Ruth Mead. The most interesting thing about this school is the little girl, the daughter of the director, who has attended three years and three months, without being either absent or tardy. Miss Mead has eleven pupils and a fairly good school house. Her recita - tions were very good. Erhaps the most interesting school which we visited in this was that taught by Mr. Jay Ouderkirk in District 71. This ate aid district and these districts are in a class all by them - among the schools of the state. The school house is the con- </seg>

The building has no foundation, and the walls are of two thicknesses of unmatched boards. There are cracks all over the walls where the rain and snow blow in, and between the roof and the walls there is an inch or so of space most of the way around. The teacher told us that on the previous Monday he had spent most of his time drying the books. He had gone home and forgotten to cover them with the oil-cloth which is kept for the purpose and there came up a storm which soaked them all. Sufficient building paper has been purchased to line the room and they expect to take time soon to put it up. Mr. Ouderkirk is a normal trainer from Franklin and a very skillful teacher. His parents are living on a homestead near the school or he would probably not be there. This district needs state aid because it is in a sand-hill region and all the land is homesteaded. The next school, Pioneer, is a decided contrast. A well-to-do district with a good house and good equipment. Miss Adams from Kansas is in charge. The most noticeable thing about this school was the one tree in the school yard. A tree out here means that some one has done a lot of patient careful work, and it is cherished as a most valuable possession as it should be. There was time for a short call at Enders before the daily train came down from Imperial. Mr. Bailey from Stratton is teaching this school and teaching it exceedingly well. He never stops talking, a serious fault in most teachers, but with him it seems to have the effect that rooting from the side lines has on the players in a game. The more he "coached" the harder they worked. He has eighteen pupils, fifteen of them boys and three of them girls. The building is new and well-equipped. There are single seats, water-jar, and a dictionary. The best thing about it though was the way every - body worked all the time. At the store we purchased crackers, cheese, peanuts and apples and sat in the auto at the station to eat them until the train came. County superintendents do not live on the fat of the land, at all times, when on visiting trips. I climbed on when the train finally did come with an egg sandwich in one hand, my suit case, a sack of lunch, my muff, hand-bag and camera in the other, and started for Palisade. All week I had heard rumors of the fine new hotel where the rooms were steam heated, and clean, and the meals good, but alas, Superintendent Furrow was on hand with a car from Hayes Center, and announced that he had planned to visit the schools between Palisade and the Center and stay at the Center. That fine hotel at Palisade will remain an unknown country for some time, I fear. One of the things that one must admire in the western counties is the way the auto drivers manage cars.

Hayes County SOf eleven state aid districts in Hayes county we saw seven, and conviction that they need aid was deepened if it were possible to &gt;en it. In order to reach these schools we drove over roads re no one had passed for days, through snow drifts, and mud and ble-weeds which filled the road full between the fences, and most he time that first afternoon we went at a breakneck speed. I g on to the brace for dear life after the first few miles. The first school was in District 77 taught by Miss Alice Stetger, not much more than a child herself. Eleven pupils were in attend - ance. The old sod house which had been used for some time had finally been abandoned. The new house is another soddie, located on the side of a very steep hill. The old house is now in use for a coal house. They have here a five months' school, and pay the teacher forty dollars. In District 44 we found Miss Edith Beckwith. This district has asked for state aid this year for the first time. The lack of money is due to the crop failure of the past season. An effort is being made to join this district to the Hayes Center district. FMiss Minnie Fornoffs was working in the next school. She eleven pupils and very kindly called classes which we wished hear. The pupils did remarkably good work. In fact, all the state aid districts in this county seemed to have an unusually bright class of pupils. This schoolhouse was a frame building, old and in poor repair. Only the most necessary furniture was in evidence and that showed the marks of long and hard usage. The text books were old and out-of-date publications, in many instances. There were four eighth grade pupils in this school preparing for the final examinations in the spring. District 72, was perhaps the most interesting one visited. A tornado blew away their schoolhouse about five years ago, and they have not been able to replace it, so the only thing they could do was to accept the use of a sod house on the farm of one of the patrons. This patron had recently built a new frame house for the family, so the old sod was no longer needed. It is of one room about ten feet square, and has a window in the east and another small one in the west. The door on the north furnishes all the other light there is. In order to reach this building you go through the barn yard, and down behind all the farm buildings is the schoolhouse. Better than nothing, by far, but a pretty poor kind of a schoolhouse after all. The teacher, Hazel Albright, is just a young girl, not much older than some of her pupils, one of whom is doing ninth </seg>
            <seg id="p131">grade work. The district has selected a new site for a school house and hopes to build soon. There are eight sections in the district. Ray Bixler is teaching in District 49. He has seven pupils. One of them is a little girl about nine years old, who rides three miles down the canyon on horseback every morning. Riding down a Hayes county canyon is not like riding over Lancaster county prairies, by a long ways, and Lancaster county children think they are dreadfully abused if they have to go three miles to school. Mr. Bixler has one pupil preparing for the examinations for a certificate, and one who is doing ninth grade work. We listened to an excel - lent recitation in general history from this pupil. Ehe last district which we visited was reached just at the noon Miss Fornoff, a sister of the teacher in the district visited in the day, was the teacher. This is another old frame build - ith no equipment but the absolute necessities. Here again the , some of them, come long distances on horseback. Efter seeing so many of these poor schools, one can come to nclusion except that any thing and everything that the state o to help these bright youngsters get some education is effort f expended. Dawes County October 20, 1913 On Sunday, October 20, 1913, I left Lincoln, for Fremont and Chadron, via the Northwestern, for the purpose of spending a day with Miss Munkres of Dawes county in her poorest schools. The train was hours late in reaching Chadron, but Miss Munkres never misses a point which she might by any possibility be expected to make, and was at the train to meet me. Breakfast was ready at her home and the horse was ready in the stable, but with all the fore - sight that had been exercised it was eleven o'clock before we were ready to start to the country. Our first visit was to be fifteen miles northwest of Chadron to the poorest schoolhouse in the county. School was not in session, but the schoolhouse is half the battle, and this one certanly was an old timer. It was built of logs and all the furniture, what there was of it, was home made. Straight backed seats and plank desks, no black board nor curtains. A new house is to be built ic this district as soon as the voters can agree on a site. Meanwhile the children are housed in this house which would not be considered fit for stock by most of the men in the district. K r e turned back toward Chadron at this place, and visited t 95 where we found Miss Baker aid her eleven pupils. En this school we went to District 17, where we found Miss a graduate of the Chadron Normal. This district lies so Chadron that many of the people prefer to give their children fit of the advantages to be had in the town schools. This down the attendance at the home schools to six. It was a ke interesting school, just the same. The pupils were not </seg>

One of the children was little Mildred Harris, six years old. She comes six miles on horseback every day all by herself, and opens a barbed wire gate on the way. I wondered how she ever got onto her horse alone, for the stirrup hung just in front of her face as she stood on the ground beside it, but she gave a funny little wiggle and before we knew it she was in her saddle, riding off down the road, switch - ing her horse first on one side and then on the other with the lariat rope she carried. To see her self-reliance and independence, made one feel that any sympathy for her on account of her long ride, was entirely missplaced. It was supper time when we got back to Chadron and Miss Munkres hospitality extended even to this and to escorting her guest to the train, which, according to custom, was Sheridan County Superintendent Kelley of Sheridan county was detained and unable to reach Rushville before noon and as it was raining we made no effort to visit in the country.

There has been built recently an addition to the building which is thoroughly up-to-date, light, airy and very pleasant. Rushville had iust been iroins? throujrh the experience of receiving </seg>

Wednesday was one of the first really cold days of the fall, and the wind was bitter at seven-thirty that morning when the car chich she had ordered came and we went for Miss Jordan, the county treasurer, who was going with us. Autoftnobiling In the western counties is full of excitement, variety and uncertainty. Owing to the unusually dry summer, the roads were extremely sandy in many places and the car stuck once or twice in a way that seemed to promise a long stay. We were good pushers, however, and in the course of time came safely through. Our first visit was about thirty miles north - west of Valentine, at district No. 11. We had some difficulty in locat - ing this school, but it was well worth while when we did get there. School was being held in one room of a homesteader cabin. The homesteader was a young man who was away from home all day. CHERRY COUNTY SCHOOL BEING TAUGHT IN ONE ROOM OF A HOMESTEADERS </seg>
            <seg id="p134">bo he did not interfere with the school, nor the school with him The room was equipped with desks and the absolute necessities of a school room, but none of the luxuries; that could hardly be expected of a state aid school. Fifteen pupils were in attendance and were taught by Mr. H. E. Paine, formerly teacher and editor at Wood Lake. Mr. Paine had taken a homestead near by or he would probably not have been available for the school. We listened with much pleasure to the reading of these pupils. They were being taught, and rightly, that reading is the foundation of all education. Leaving this district at recess we turned back and stopped at District 28. Here we found a good fri'me building, properly lighted and well arranged. Fifteen pupils were in attendance. The grounds are fenced with one strand of barb wire and are practically free to all the stock in the neighborhood. When our car drove up, about a CHERRY COUNTY RURAL SCHOOL, DISTRICT No. 148.

We had a fine dinner at the hospitable home of Mrs. after which we drove back to visit Mr. Elliott in District 4. Hpre we found eleven pupils. This district is very small and poor and would be helpless without the state aid. It is joined by district 28 which is also a small poor district. It seems as though the thing for these two districts to do is to consolidate and make one good sized and independent district. Perhaps they will do so in the near future. We were not sorry when the long ride hack to Valentine was over and we were once more in Mias Thackrey's cozy office. The </seg>
            <seg id="p135">DISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID Valentine teachers came to her home to spend the evening with us and add the finishing touch to a pleasant visit. While the visit was pleasant the leaving was not so enjoyable. Every train out of Valentine was loaded with people who had been there to register for land. The specials which were run in addition to the regular trains were crowded with men of all classes, who filled the town and the station and the streets. One train which left half an hour before the regular evening train east carried four or five coaches, all of them crowded, and but three women on the whole train. I decided to take the regular train to Ainsworth, to visit Brown county schools. Brown County Miss Burritt's nice fat old horse was a soothing means of loco - motion after the big powerful car in Valentine, even though it did not cover so much ground. Our first visit was to district 55, just north of Ainsworth. Here we found Mr. Mather and sixteen pupils. One thing that struck me as very unusual was the telephone in the school - house. Miss Burritt tells me that many of the schools in her county are equipped in this way. The parents find it a great convenience to be able to reach their children at any time of day. It is particu - larly convenient in case of storm. From here we went across to District 20 where we found Miss Lehman with fifteen pupils. This finished the morning's work, and we went back to Ainsworth for dinner. In the afternoon we went to the school that Miss Burritt says is the worst in the county. The pupils are hard to control and the parents do not give the teacher the support she needs. We found a beginning teacher here and she was said to be holding the school unusually well. Miss Burritt has some interesting experiences in the southern sand hill part of the county where the roads are hard to follow and the houses are far apart. On one of her first trips down there she found herself with night coming on and only two houses any where near. She stopped at the first and asked if she could be accom - modated there for the night. They told her they would be glad to take her in. There were eleven people there already to sleep in one room but they would make room for her, too. She asked who lived at the other house and said that before deciding she would go there and see what the prospects were. There she found just two people to stay in one room so she decided to throw her lot in with them. The week beginning October 27 was spent in Sioux, Box Butte, Octobei 27, 1913 </seg>
            <seg id="p136">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Sioux County I left Lincoln Sunday night, October 26 and was in Crawford Monday morning bright and early. Miss Fenske from Harrison had come down the night before and we were ready to start on our trip in Sioux county in good season. In a little Ford car we went west from Crawford, through the grounds of Fort Robinson to Glen. At Glen we turned south' and shortly found ourselves in a little canyon where we couldn't turn around if we wanted to. The school which we were trying to find was in District 61 which Miss Fenske had never visited. I asked her if she was ever lost and she replied "Lost, I'm lost from the time that I leave town." As we went down that canyon for miles and miles we didn't feel any too sure that we were on the right track. It was a beautiful little canyon with a stream of clear water running along beside the road, and sides dotted with evergreen trees, but it didn't seem to be getting us any where, and it got narrower and narrower until the stream ran down the middle of the road. At one place we passed a log building stand - ing up on the side of the canyon, half done and we wondered if that was the new school house which the district was supposed to be building. At another, there was a little saw-mill and we hoped that we could learn there whether we were on the right road or not. A saw-mill in Nebraska is an unusual thing and I was as much inter - ested in that as in the canyon. There was no one at home, so there was nothing to do but go back to the car and go on again. The farther we went the harder the going was for the car. There were many steep little hills in the road and the little Ford car had a harder and harder time climbing them until finally on a particularly steep little hill it stuck, apparently never to go again. We backed up and tried it again, over and over, without success. Finally Miss Fenske and I got out and climbed the side of the canyon to ?ee if we could get any hint of where we were, while the driver coaxed his car. He had better success than we for he did get up the hill and we didn't get any clue to our where-abouts, beyond seeing a little house way over to the south west. The only way to find out where you are out there is to have some one tell you, so we made for that house. After being stuck on a "high center" and shoveled off, we finally reached there and found that we had missed District 61, entirely, but were close to District 33. We found school being taught in an old dwelling. The room was perhaps twelve by ten feet. The four double desks and the stove filled the room pretty full. Three pupils were in attendance, and visitors being a rather rare occurrence they were exceedingly embarrassed. One small boy went to the board to do some arithmetic. He was so self conscious that he could hardly ask the necessary directions from the teacher, but made his wants known by motions. The other boys read very nicely for us, and we enjoyed the visit greatly. The schoolhouse was standing up on top of the hill where the wind had a clear sweep </seg>
            <seg id="p137">DISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID at it, and it was so cold that they had decided to move it, hence the school in the dwelling. There are sixteen sections in the district, but it needs help from the state to support school. From here we went three miles west to District 25 where we found a good sod school house and a big school. Eighteen pupils were in attendance, many of them big boys and girls. There was practically no equip - ment, but there was an organ. These children brought all the ■ which they wished to drink during the day. when they came from home in the morning. It is hard for us in the eastern part of the state to realize just what this means. If the day is warm or the child unusually thirsty, and the water gives out before night, he must either borrow or go thirsty. In most schools the teachers have found it better not to allow the children to borrow. It was noon when we left this school and we discussed the question of getting dinner, finally deciding that time was more of an object than eating so we started back to look for the school which we had missed in the morning. The first thing was to get directions, so we stopped at the first house we came to, where it happened that they were threshing, and asked how we should get to that school which was being held in some one's house. The directions which were given us sounded awfully complicated and involved, but we started out to get as far as we could following them, trusting to luck that we would come to another house where we might be sent on before we got too far out of the way. As nearly as I can repeat them they were as follows: Go back the way you came through the gate, turn to the left and go down a lane between two fences, until you pass two houses on the left then turn to your right and go over the top of that high green hill that you see over there then go down the hill and you will see the house on the side of the hill ahead of you. Perhaps these direc - tions sound simple enough now, but they didn't work ou' . More than that the men had a heated discussion as to whether we could get down the hill if we succeeded in getting up. The road, they said, was very steep and rocky and there was some doubt in their minds as to whether the brakes would hold the car going down. This was not very soothing to two women who were none too com - fortable about the driving any way, but there was nothing to do but go on, so we went. We followed the directions as well as we could, but we didn't find all the landmarks, and had to trust to luck to quite a measure. Finally we came to the hill that answered the description of the one that would be dangerous to go down. It was steep and rocky and there was a sharp curve in the steepest pitch, but we got down safely, thanking fortune at every step that we didn't have to go up it. Half way down we came to a gate which had to be opened, and nearby stood a house. Through the open door we could see three men just sitting down to dinner. Our driver went to the door to ask if we were on the right road while we sat in the car and hoped for an invitation to dinner. No invita - tion was forthcoming, and we found we were on the wrong road and </seg>
            <seg id="p138">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT must needs go back up that dreadful hill. One of the men went with us from here to be sure we made no further wrong turns and we started back. As we came to the steep place we all got out and pushed and went up without trouble. The ride from here was cer - tainly a wild one. The road wound around among trees, down the steepest kind of hills, and was full of sand and rocks. Our driver seemed to be getting hungry and drove even faster than he had earlier in the day, which was needless, while Miss Fenske and I set our teeth and hung on for dear life. We seemed likely to hit a high center, a stump or a rock in the road any minute. We did hit one rock a bump which nearly sent us over the wind shield, and which it afterward developed, bent the steering rod until it was almost im - possible to keep the machine in the road. We didn't know it was bent until we were back on level ground so that didn't hurt us. After five or six miles of this sort of going, we came out in a kind of valley on the opposite side of which was the house which we were hunting. In a few minutes we were over there, but the prospects for a school looked very paor. The house was an unpainted two - room building standing in the middle of a fenced lot. Every foot of this lot was covered with old tin cans, sticks, fire wood and rub - bish of all kinds. The school we found being held in the teacher's sleeping room. The school equipment consisted of two twelve foot boards laid over two little carpenter's horses, making a table possibly two feet by four. The pupils sat around this table and did what studying they felt was absolutely not to be avoided. The books which they were not using were on the dresser with the lamp and other toilet articles. The wraps were thrown down on the bed, together with the extra cover, and the family cat. The dog was taking his nap under the bed. Of the sixteen pupils in this district who should have been in school, three were present, and who could wonder. The half finished log house which we had passed in the morning, was the new school house. It had been begun and a disagreement about something had arisen among the patrons so it was left half finished and the children were most of them not going to school at all. This was a district which was asking aid of the state, but was doing nothing for the children itself. An unusually unfortunate state of affairs. We hope before another year they will decide that it is more important to give the children an education than to have everything about the school house just exactly the way every one wants it. Leaving here about three o'clock we told the driver we wanted to visit one more school but when we found out where we were again we were back at Glen. Evidently his appetite had overcome hia inclination to visit more schools, and it was well that it was so, for we had not been back in Crawford half an hour before the rain poured down. If it had caught us down among those canyons we would probably have been there yet. We were fully ready to do </seg>

Box Butte County I left Crawford for Alliance on the evening train, reaching there about half past twelve. The rain had changed to sleet by this time and it was bitterly cold. It continued cold the next morning, so County Superintendent Delia M. Reed and I decided that we would not try to make a trip to the country. It happened that the director of district which was asking for state aid was in town and I was very glad indeed to meet him and learn something of the struggles of that district to maintain a school. The patrons donate prac - tically all the work about the grounds and building, even to putting up the house themselves, but they can't possibly pay off the debt that has been hanging over their heads so long. It certainly seems that people who do so much for themselves are entitled to support from the state. It is a decided contrast to the conditions in the district last visited. E spent the morning in the Alliance schools clearing up the city :ate situation there. Since the ward building burned last winter maining rooms are crowded to the utmost. None but an ex - nally strong corps of teachers could keep things running so hly. They will appreciate having the fine new building when eady, though. Morrill County In the afternoon I went to Bridgeport. This seems to be the greatest town in the state for holding conventions and associations. As the hotel accommodations there are limited at best, it would be impossible to get a place to stay when a convention is in session if the people did not open their houses. This time it was the irriga - tion congress and every room in the hotel was taken. It never has been necessary for me to sleep on the sidewalk yet, though I should have preferred it on some occasions, and this time it was County Superintendent Thompson who came to the rescue. She has a little cottage down in the south part of town where she and her brother keep house. It keeps her very busy, but she is a very energetic lady and is equal to the emergency. Incidentally be it said that she is a number one cook. Her brother is a lucky man to have such a house keeper. Morrill is such a big county and the schools are so far apart and the roads so poor that one school was all we could visit and get back to town for the train at three thirty. We left town with a livery team about eight o'clock and it was noon before we reached the building in District 28, which Miss Thompson said was the poorest district in the county. We found an old sod school - house rather the worse for wear and eleven pupils. The teacher was an eighth grader from a neighboring district who was teaching on a </seg>

No time was wasted here, when classes were over there was a drill in mental arithmetic for the whole school. At noon one of the boys ex - hibited a model of a flying machine which he had made out of odds and ends which he had picked up here and there. We were delighted with the wide awake air of the whole school. As we drove home Miss Thompson said "the more I know of schools and school children the more convinced I am that the progress the children make doesn't depend in the least upon what you give them to work with. The children out there in these poor districts seem to get just as much out of it as the children in the best equipped town schools." Having taught in some of the best town schools she knows what she is talk - ing about. This District No. 28 has had some unusual experiences. rDY" IN DISTRICT No. 28, MORRILL COUNTY. NOTE THE PROPS AND BRACES There is one high tempered man in the district who did not wish his children to go to school in the old building. School began while he was away last fall and he was very angry about it when he got back. It was not long after this that some one went up to the house with a team one dark night, hitched on to one end with a chain and yank - ed the whole end out. It pretty nearly ruined the house and accounts for the braces and props in evidence around it now. It didn't put an end to the school though, for they put the scattered sod back in place and fixed it up until it was entirely safe. School is going on there just as though nothing had happened. Miss Thompson has some great experiences riding around on her pony as she visits the schools. It is nothing unusual for her to </seg>
            <seg id="p141">DISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID she shall spend the night gets pretty serious, but there has always been a place, so far. She tells of riding all one afternoon without meeting any one or finding a school. Night was coming on and she was getting anxious when she met two children going home from school. She asked them if there was a house near by where she might stay and they invited her home with them. It developed that their mother was dead and the father was doing the best he could to do his own work and bring them up, and they made her welcome. By dint of strenuous urging of the black team we got back to port for the afternoon train and I went on down to Oshkosh. Garden County Oshkosh is the county seat of Garden county and a new super - intendent, Miss Nellie Olson, had just been appointed by the com - missioners. California is very prcud of her native sons. Garden county has some native daughters of whom it may well be proud. Miss Olson is one of them. She was born and brought up on a ranch south of Oshkosh, and knows conditions in that county thor - oughly. She has both teams and a car at her command so will have no difficulty in getting around to make her visits. I spent the morn - ing until recess time in Miss Olson's office and in the Oshkosh schools. Oshkosh needs a new schoolhouse badly and is now discussing build - ing projects. Four teachers are employed now, two in the school house and two in the building which has been secured as an addition. The school is in good shape and deserves better quarters. At ten thirty Miss Olson and I started with a fine team of bays for a school fifteen miles north of town, which receives state aid. The sheriff said we could make that fifteen miles, sand hills and all in an hour and a half. It seemed like asking a good deal of any team, to me, but we made it. At District 23 we found an exceedingly poor schoolhouse. Repairs were needed in every place where r&lt; pairs could be made, from the broken door step to the broken window panes. The furniture was good but the room was very dirty. The teacher was very much embarrassed and we heard no recitations. Fourteen pupils were present. The worst thing that the Garden county schools have to face is debt. Most of the districts are carry - ing anywhere from one to seven hundred dollars. We asked how this was incurred in the first place and were told that school officers often said "Oh, we won't be here long, we'll buy what we want. The next fellow can pay for it." The people who are living there now are trying earnestly to run their school economically and well, but they are carrying a heavy load. With the aid of the money which the state can allow them we hope to see a substantial decrease in the indebtedness this year. At District 51 we found Miss Swindle with nine pupils doing good work.

Methods of dis - cipline were such that chey left the pupils' in a resentful mood. It was interesting to see those youngsters climb onto their horses and start for home as fast as the horses could run, when school was dismissed. From the district it was an easy drive back to Oshkosh, down the beautiful valley of the Platte. The sun was just setting as we reached the top of the hill leading down into the valley, and the view was beautiful with the purple hills in the distance, the river at their foot and the valley with its brown fields on either side. ■yike Miss Thompson, Miss Olson is keeping house for a brother, s most hospitable to visiting strangers.

Garden county was the last d on this trip. November, 1913. My next trip was to Wheeler, Garfield, Blaine, Thomas, Loup and Hooker counties. Wheeler County The ride to Erickson is tiresome and uneventful in the extreme but it finally comes to an end about six o'clock. I had hoped Miss Bowler would send a team for me as she had said she would try to do, but owing to a misunderstanding as to the time of my coming, she didn't, so as early Tuesday morning as the livery man would get around, (people take life easy in the sand h:lls, time being no object) which was about eight o'clock, we started for Bartlett. The team was a pair of good little brown ponies, but with the best will in the world we couldn't make very good time through the deep sand. The driver was a young fellow much interested in my work and in the teachers, especially the young women, and was quite delighted over the idea of visiting schools. He knew where a good many of them were, so we stopped at one which was on our way. This was a tiny little school house, say ten by twelve feet, with two windows on each side. It wes fairly well furnished and the ten children present were fairly digging into their lessons. The teacher wu a young girl brought up in the neighborhood. She was perfectly composed and called special classes as though it were an every day occurrence to have visitors drop in like that. This school house was equipped with a bell, with the rope hanging outside. A good chance for everyone to ring the bell before going in. It was a pleasant school, and made a good impression of the county. Eight sand hill </seg>

            <seg id="p144">jDISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID miles from Here found us in Bartlett, at the office of the County Superintendent, Miss Bowler. She is a cripple, and has lived in the sand hills for many years. She loves them in their many different phases. Visiting is very hard for her, because it is so hard for her to get in and out of a buggy and many places a car cannot go on account of the sand. The dry weather last summer has made the roads worse than usual. The schools are so far apart and the roads so poor that two schools a day are all she can visit. It takes her about twenty-five days to get around. She takes a driver and goes out for a week at a time. Since she has lived in the county so long she has friends everywhere and has no trouble finding suitable places to stay nights. Bartlett and Erickson, the two towns in the county, are deadly rivals — when one makes an improvement the other immediately 'goes it one better" in the same line. Two years ago Bartlett milt a nice two-room, one story, stone school house. The next fear Erickson built a three-room, one story house which any town might be proud of. At present Bartlett is a move ahead in the game, with a two story, four room county high school. There is a very mall enrollment in this school this year, but they are doing good work and hope for more pupils next year. No doubt, more will go when it is understood that everyone pays to support the school whether the children attend or not. Bartlett is a small town and a good share of the pupils come a long ways. In the primary room there is a family of three small boys, probably six, eight and ten years old, who drive six miles every morning and night. Owing to the difficulty of getting transportation — the one car in town refused to take us on account of sand, and the two-seated rig needed to carry three of us would make us too slow — it was finally decided that Miss Bowler should give me directions and my interested driver was delighted to help hunt for schools. Four miles straight west of Bartlett we found the Clear Creek school. The same little four-windowed kind of a building which we had seen in the morning. There was no coal house, the supply ot coal being dumped on the ground beside the building. This is a district which beside being badly in debt lacks funds enough to sup - port its own school, and asks help of the state. The furniture re - flected the financial straits. There were three double seats and one single one of regulation make, also a table for the teacher, one double desk and seat and the recitation bench were home made. The text books used were excellent. I judged from conditions in every school visited, that the county superintendent was making a special effort along the line of proper books. My sympathy was very much aroused for the biggest boy in school. He was wearing no shoes, but heavy woolen socks, much the worse for wear at heel and toe. It's decidedly cool weather to be walking a mile to school 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p145">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT in such foot gear. My sympathy was rather rudely checked though when the teacher told me that there had been an accident to the boy's foot wear while they were jumping at recess, and that he was no victim of poverty. There were five boys and three girls in this school and they were doing excellent work in spite of the fact that they have had not more than seven months school for several years and this year has money enough for only three. The school house Kas moved last summer to the disgust of some in the district. They ,y the school house was "stolen." TYPICAL WHEELER COUNTY SCHOOLHOUSE Four Corners . School six miles farther on is the same four - windowed little house which seems to be universal in Wheeler county. Instead of plaster, the walls are boarded and painted a bright blue. Six pupils were present, five girls and one boy. A lesson on the famous painters was in progress and they seemed much interested in the works of Joshua Reynolds. The teacher here was a young lady from Blair. This school is self supporting. Wheeler county is fast reaching the point where it will require no aid from the state. Two years ago some twenty districts were in need. This year only five. Much of this improvement is due to the increased value of the land, much to the judicious advice of the county superintendent. Two years more will probably see then entirely independent. "Where there's a will, there's a way." Garfield County I left Greeley on the evening train for Burwell. That is always busy town so far as the hotel is concerned, at least. Prospect for </seg>
            <seg id="p146">DISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID a room was very poor but I was finally assigned one that would hold a single bed a washstand and a chair and me, if I didn't move around. It was clean and quiet and that covers a multitude of rhort comings. At nine o'clock next morning Superintendent Jenkins came with his team of bay ponies and we crossed the Loup river south of town and started for the poor schools which were near enough to be visited. At the first place where we stopped the schoolhouse, an old time soddie had been dismantled. The roof was off and the furniture piled out side. Desks and seats were hand made and spoke unmistakably of the poverty of the district. Lumber for a new house was at hand and I have no doubt they are in their new frame building ere this. This was the district where the people said they had to suggest to the teacher that it was time for her to take a bath. They said her favorite method of sewing in sleeves was with safety-pins. From here we went to the Conrad school in District 32. Here we found a sod house in good condition, good home made furniture, recitation bench and teacher's table. There was an organ in the room and the seven pupils present were working well. It was the kind of a school which it is a pleasure to visit. Of the eight pupils enrolled five had been perfect in attendance so far. All water comes from the nearest house, a quarter of a mile away, brought by one of the pupils. It was to this house, Mr. Conrad's, that we went for dinner. We were not expected but we had a lovely fried chicken dinner. Mrs. Conrad tells some of the experiences which they had when they settled there on their homestead years ago, which makes us realize that homesteading is not all a path of roses. They drove onto their claim in their canvas wagon and lived in it for weeks while the sod house and barn were being built. All the cooking had to be done in a tent and when the wind blew, as it did most of the time, the sand came in in clouds and filled everything; dishes, cook - ing utensils and food. It was cold and there was no way of keeping the wind out. Finally their house was ready and the well down, and they moved in. Then came the surveyor to verify their lines and they found, oh tragedy, that the improvements were all on the other man's land. Then it was all to be done over again. I wonder if we would be willing to pioneer as our ancestors did. Ii'rom this school we went to District 31. Here we found a nice i building with barn and well. Single seats had been bought money from box socials, one social bringing them sixty dollars, erine Nelson was the teacher and was doing nice work. The was nice and neat and there were six pupils present. This 1 was a most encouraging example of what the people in a ct can do for their school, if they try, even if the district is ■One of the exciting things about driving in the sand hills is you never know when you are going to find the road that you always been in the habit of following from place to place. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT fenced in. That means that you either have to drive around the fenced in place, perhaps several miles, or take down the fence. Superintendent Jenkins found such a fenced in place after leaving District 31. He decided to drive around rather than take down the fence, and eventually we came out on the main high road leading to Burwell. I was entertained for supper at the home of Mrs. Grunkel - meyer, Mr. Jenkins daughter. Her three small boys make things lively for her but she enjoys it all as any one must who goes there. The only drawback to this visit was that it was ended by a phone call from Mrs. McKimmey, superintendent of Loup County, saying that she was ready to start for Taylor, and was waiting for me. Of course I hurried back to the hotel, paid my bill, and we were soon on our way to Taylor in a big touring car. It was a lovely moon - light night and I thoroughly enjoyed the ten mile ride. Loup County It was halfpast ten when we drove up to Mrs. McKimmey's home, where I was entertained for the time that I spent in Taylor. Mrs. McKim - mey had supper already so of course we ate again. Next morning after a vain hunt for a car that would take us out to the poor schools in the sand hills, Mrs. McKimmey and I started with a team for District 23. The auto men would not take their cars out into the sandy roads. We had not driven three miles before we met a fine big car being towed in, and were thankful for our team. Dis - trict 23 is five miles from Taylor and is a state aid school. Here was one of the poorest school houses I have seen. It is an old, old soddie, with the sod all falling out of the corner. There were six broken window panes in four windows, filled with card board and papers. Inside we found the plaster all falling off the walls and the floor made of rough boards. The furniture was good. There were eleven pupils present, seven of them having had a perfect attendance record for the year. We heard a perfect recitation in reading from the primary class and all pupils were working hard. This school house stands in a field surrounded by a barb wire fence, and the school house itself is surrounded by another barb wire fence. There is a gate in the second fence but it is boarded up to keep the cattle out. It takes a person gifted with some acrobatic tendencies to reach the house at all. The teacher, Miss Martha Kriegel, lives in Taylor and walks out every morning. Of course she starts before daylight. This district needs a new schoolhouse urgently and will have one as soon as possible. Bonds have already been voted, but some dis - cord in the district is delaying action Two members of the board who have no children, object to the expense. Ky the time we were ready to leave this school it was noon. s in Loup county are a long ways apart and the sandy make fast driving impossible, so we decided we could visit &gt;ne more school any way, and would stop for dinner. The </seg>
            <seg id="p148">DISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID home of the moderator was on our way and we stopped there and begged a bite. A nice lunch was prepared for us and what was far more important, our horses were fed, and we went on our way re - freshed. Miss Lottie Rose was the next teacher visited and a nicer school it would be hard to find. It was a sod school house and there were but eight pupils in attendance, but they were all working as busily and happily as you will find children anywhere. The little folks recited for us some of the poerty they had been learning. This was the more remarkable as some of the children were so shy they would not talk to the teacher when they started to school. Miss Rose comes four miles on horse back to school. When sh» is ready to start home she dons her corduroy riding skirt and her big steel spur and starts out on her saddle horse. The teachers up here have great times, some of them. Mrs. Gerrard, who teaches farther north, drives seven miles morning and night, fords two creeks and a river and picks up most of her pupils on the way. Contrast that with the teacher in town who grumbles about riding a couple of miles on the street car. We went home from this school in a driving snow storm and were cold and hungry when we reached Taylor. Blaine County The next day was Saturday and was to be devoted by me to a drive from Taylor to Brewster, about sixty miles. There is a mail route from Taylor to Almeria and from Almeria to Brewster so the trip was to be made with the carriers. The first leg was made in a car. Now a car is all right if it works well, but this one didn't. It was a one seated car with a little single seat stuck on behind and it was loaded with mail sacks and packages. One tire was leaking and after repeated fillings the driver took it off and we rode into Almeria on the rim. A surer way to get there but not a more com - fortable one. The storm of the night before had passed on and it was a perfect fall day. At Almeria we stopped for dinner and from there on the conveyance was a single buggy and team. There were three of us to make the next twenty-five miles and it certainly looked as if there would have to be some strenuous measures to get the three people and the sacks of mail into that buggy but we did it and lived to tell the tale. The other passenger went only ten miles of the way. From there on it was entirely comfortable. At Ferguson we changed horses and started on the last ten miles. It was certainly a long ten miles. The road winds along near the Loup river most of the way, and it is a beautiful country. It seems almost impossible that there is any district near there which cannot support its own schools, but Blaine and Loup counties receive more aid than any other counties of their size in the state. About half past seven we drove up to the hotel in Brewster. I had been assured it was a good hotel but was not at all prepared for the cozy </seg>

The warm fire and hot i was waiting, were most welcome after the all day's clean and warm little room was also greatly appreciated. I wanted to get to Dunning to spend Sunday with some friends, but modes of transportation seemed few. It finally developed that I could get passage with a young man who was going over early in the morning, he said. You don't want to take too seriously a sand hiller's interpretation of early. I was up and ready to go at eight. At twenty minutes of eleven we started. The car was one which the young man, who was called Happy by his friends, had resurrected from the scrap heap. He said he knew it would run, but he didn't know how far. It was in the bargain when we started that I should be ready to walk in, whether it was five miles or fifteen, if worst came to worse. We finally reached Dunning without serious delay. After spending a pleasant day there, the question of getting back assumed serious proportion. It was finally settled by engaging a livery team to be ready to start at half past six next morning. It was ready a little before eight. But that too is a small matter. Two miles out of town we passed "Happy's" car deserted in the middle of the road. Along about noon we met him plugging along toward Brewster. We had been there, come half way back and visited one school. He said he had had a good bit of trouble, but he was still happy. The first school visited in Blaine county was the Lucy school about half way between Brewster and Dunning. The schoolhouse is built of cement blocks and is a nice little building. Miss Martin, the teacher, is a home girl living two or three miles beyond the school house. She drives the distance to school as do most of the children. There were twelve children present, eight girls and four boys. All were working hard. The reading classes which we heard recite were very good. The furniture was also in fair condition. There wag but one outhouse in this district and it stood across the road from the schoolhouse. We had a serious time finding the schoolhouse or rather the house where school is being held in the next district. I never get over the dazed feeling that comes to me whenever a county superin - tendent leaves the road and strikes across the country in a bee line for the school house he is trying to locate, hills and fences, fields and draws are mere incidents, the fences are taken down and most any - thing else is driven through or over. In this case the old road had been fenced and after following the fence for a mile or two Superin - tendent Shamblin decided to waste no more time so he took down the wires with the pliers which every one carries in that part of the country and we drove through. He put up the fence behind us and we found ourselves almost at once in the road we had been looking for. Shortly we came to the house where school was being held. It was in one room of an old sod homestead house. The school </seg>
            <seg id="p150">DISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID furniture had all been moved over and the fourteen pupils were as comfortable as they would have been in the schoolhouse and did not have to go nearly so far to get there. It was the third month of school and none of the pupils had missed more than half a day. The teacher, Miss Nellie Houder, and her brother drive two miles and a half. We heard excellent work in the primary classes, poorer work in grammar grades but the teacher was so embarrassed, that we felt that we were not seeing the school under the best conditions. It was here that Superintendent Shamblin earned an extra star in his crown I am sure. He refused a fried chicken dinner at the house where he had taken the horses to feed, because he had left me at the schoolhouse and he wouldn't eat when his visitor couldn't. It isn't half so bad to go without dinner when no one else has had any, but it is bad to have every one else well fed except yourself. I From here we went to a school taught by Mrs. M. L.

Bfe reached Dunning again in was certainly appreciated, clock breakfast. season for a most excellent supper as it was the first meal since a Thomas County I took the evening train for Thedford and spent Tuesday with Miss Oakes in the Thedford schools and in the country. There has been a wonderful improvement in the Thedford schools in the last two years. The school board has made a special effort to get good teachers and carry on a good school and the results certainly justify the effort. The enrollment has increased and the interest of both pupils and patrons is thoroughly awake. Miss Oakes does not like to go into the country without a driver who knows the way well. She loses her directions easily and getting lost in the sandhills is no joke. Visiting under such circumstances is something of a problem. A carriage is so heavy that it can hardly be used on the sandy roads, and riding three on the seat of a single buggy is decidedly uncomfortable. We finally decided to go to a little school in the country but still belonging to the Thedford district and got lost only once getting down there. The way those roads wind around need a special sense to keep the directions. We found a nice little schoolhouse built last fall, single seats properly arranged, the big ones in one row and the little ones in another.

Keya Paha County December 1, 1913. The next trip was the first week in December to the counties along the line of the Northwestern. I left Lincoln Sunday noon and reached Ainsworth at midnight that night. They said the stage left for Springview at seven the next morning, which did not give a very long night to sleep. Its safe to count on stages being late as a rule and this was no exception. It was nearly half past eight when we were finally on our way to Keya Paha county. In pleasant weather its a beautiful drive across there but in my experience pleasant weather there is a rare thing. On this occasion it was rain - ing and foggy and the damp air was exceedingly piercing. I was very cold when we finally reached Springview about two o'clock. It was good to see Miss "Bee" O'Donnell's smiling face waiting for me, and better yet to go to her boarding place where Mrs. Dietrick had kept a nice dinner hot for me. After doing full justice to this, and having a visit with county superintendent Boshart, I went to visit the Springview school. Mr. Kirsch, a Keya Paha county boy, is principal and is doing the best work possible under the circum - stances. The room is small and he has too many grades, but his quiet efficient manner makes it possible for him to accomplish the maximum amount. The intermediate room is crowded too. Spring - view labors under the disadvantage of most inland towns, the maxi - mum tax levy makes it impossible to support school as it should be supported. It seems to me that the normal training allowance has done much for this school both in equipment and in teaching force. It rained all night Monday and was still raining Tuesday morning. It was Out of the question for Superintendent Boshart to take his new car out in such weather and over such roads and equally out of the question to get any where with a team, so we talked the matter of state aid over in his office and let the visiting go until next time. The prospect for the twenty-eight mile drive back to Ainsworth was not very promising, but we thought that we in the stage stood a better chance of getting there than the people in the two cars which started about the same time. One of the cars we passed stuck on the Niobrara hill, but it was pulled out of the mud and passed us a few miles farther on distancing us completely into the big city. It was nearly nine when we drove up to the Osborne </seg>
            <seg id="p152">DISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID hotel, and supper was over long ago. The obliging darkey boy had been expecting me, however, and soon had a nice hot supper ready. That was the night the electric lights were off in Ainsworth, the report was that the power dam on the river had gone out — any way the city was in darkness and the girl who called us in the morning added to her usual statement of the time "Here's a lamp." The big dining room with its two little lamps presented a ghastly appearance. Rock County It was still raining when I reached Bassett about eight o'clock next morning, and County Superintendent Dugger thought it would not be advisable to try to get to any of the state aid schools from there so we spent the morning enjoying the truly good schools in Bassett. It gave me quite a shock to find two members of the town school board visiting at the same time. They don't wait up there until there is some trouble before finding out how the schools are being conducted, but plan to spend a day there every month. Everything was running as smoothly as possible, teachers, pupils, every one seemed to be enjoying the work. The town takes pride in keeping its school good, which speaks volumes for the kind of a town it is. Holt County I left Bassett at noon for O'Neill, rather expecting to have the same experience there, but Miss Miller was at the train to meet me and said she had planned a trip for the next day and had a car engaged to take us, if I was game. I told her I was game for any - thing she was, so we started at nine o'clock from the lovely new Golden' Hotel for Amelia. The schools we wished to visit were south still of Amelia, but Miss Miller had planned to stop there for dinner and to get a guide for the rest of the way if she could. When she mentioned this plan to some one in O'Neill they said "Oh, you can get a guide all right, any one will go with you. Even the black - smith will leave his work to go." and sure enough it was the black - smith who went with us. It was a damp misty day, and we couldn't see a quarter of a mile ahead of us most of the time. We were lost before we got five miles from O'Neill. It was in the sandy country so the more it rained the harder the roads were. It wasn't muddy but I never saw such rough roads before in all my life. The driver drove like mad and Miss Miller and I rattled around in the tonneau like two peas in a pod. I think we were not still two consecutive minutes all day. About ten miles from O'Neill we stopped at a little schoolhouse where Miss Miller had some business with the teacher. This was a state aid district, but the teacher was a stranger and I was not allowed to go in. From here we went through the flowing well region where there were artesian wells on every hand. Holt county certainly has a varied surface. There are the sand hills in </seg>
            <seg id="p153">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT the south, the flowing wells north of that and still farther north the clay lands where it gets so slippery in the rainy season that it is not safe to go there. Mis? Miller tells of one schoolhouse up in that part of the country which stands on the banks of the creek. It can be reached only by crossing a little footbridge and it isn't safe to drive nearer than three quarters of a mile. I asked why they didn't move the house and she said it was the best place in the district for it. She says she never has any difficulty in getting some one to drive for her because she is such a good pusher. She pushed one car out of Swan Lake, she says, and another out of Red Bird Creek. Her unfailing good nature would be even more of an inducement than her ability as a pusher, if I were the driver. We finally reached Amelia in time for dinner, ate as quickly as possible and started on for the schools which we hoped to reach. All this time it was so misty that it was almost a rain and threatened every minute to get worse. At last we came to the schoolhouse. A poor old sod build - ing miles from any where it seemed. Building, equipment, every - thing was of the poorest. Several teachers had been engaged by the board in the fall but had refused to stay and teach when they saw the building. Finally Mr. Holcomb was secured and it was a happy day for the district when he went there, for he is a natural born teacher and those unusually bright youngesters are getting more from their five months school than many a city youngster does in his nine. This is a district that is doing its best. Bonds have been voted for a new building and before another year passes the house will probably be ready. The board and the patrons do as much of the work as possible, and I felt that this was another district well deserving all the help we could give them. From here we went on south and east almost to Wheeler county to call at a school which Miss Miller had been able to visit only once before in all her term of office. We found a mere slip of a girl teaching here doing the best she could with her few pupils. !A trip like this gives one an idea of the work of the superin - ient in a county like Holt. The schools are not all in session at time, so a trip in any direction leaves some schools unvisited means a trip like the one we took to be made later. We drove &gt;ty-four miles starting at nine and getting back at five, stopped three school houses, not more than half an hour at any one, &gt;ped half an hour for dinner, and that was all we could possibly in one day. I was not sorry to call my week's work done with this trip and to go on back to Lincoln with an added respect for Holt county and its superintendent. Keith County December 10, 1913. It was Wednesday of the next week before I was ready to leave again, this time for Keith county. Mrs. Richmond, the county </seg>
            <seg id="p154">DISTRICTS ENTITLED TO STATE AID superintendent, met me at the train at Ogallalla Thursday morning and we were soon on our way for the north part of the county and the state aid schools. Luck was with us and we were fortunate enough to get to all but two of them. Our first stop was made at District 13. This is another school which is being held in a deserted dwelling. It is a funny looking schoolhouse. Old, yellow, long and low. I should judge that the room was 10 by 25 feet with six foot eaves. A partition had been taken out between the two rooms of the house to make room for the school, making a room more than twice as long as it was wide. Margery Reed, a teacher from the normal training class of the Ogallalla high school was teaching her first school here. She was a refreshing sight in her immaculate white middy blouse and neat short skirt. Six pupils were present and were doing excellent work. The room was decorated with teddy bears which the children had made and Hallowe'en emblems. Many schools in the wealthy eastern districts would have to take a back seat for this state aid school. Our next visit was at a school in sharp contrast to this. District 39 has a nice frame house, sheds for the horses and there were sixteen pupils present. The teacher is an Illinois girl who lives with a cousin in the district and drives four miles to school. Most of the pupils drive too, there were three teams and four saddle horses in the sheds, quite a livery stable. This was a good school, every one working and every one happy. We left here just at noon and ate the lunch which Mrs. Richmond had brought as we drove to the next school, District 47. This is an in - teresting district for several reasons. There is very likely to be trouble in the school and it is very badly in debt. The debt seems to be the least of its troubles, however. We found Miss Mae Matthews teaching eight pupils. She seems to be having no trouble. This was a fairly good frame house. From here we went on still farther north and east to District 52 Miss Andrews, an inexperienced little girl, is teaching here and acting upon every suggestion given her. Some day she will be a fine teacher. Six papils were present. The house was a tiny little frame house about ten by fifteen, with single seats, a good table for the teacher, three windows and no cloak room. The yard was all blown out and the director and his boys were busy putting up a fence. I'rom here we drove on to District 53, where Mrs. Carl Barnts is ng. This was a nice new school house, unpainted as yet. were good single seats and a good chair and table for the »r. No shades had been provided but newspapers were doing at the windows. Thirteen pupils were present and they were all ng hard and well. It was four o'clock when we left this school and there was a thirty-five mile drive between us and Ogallalla, so we got under way as expeditiously as possible. It was just dark when we reached Mrs. Richmond's home and the speedometer registered seventy-four miles for the day* I enjoyed Mrs. Richmond's hospitality for thp ni ht </seg>
            <seg id="p155">and in the morning went on Chappell where Mrs. Brown, county superintendent of that county, met me. Her household was rather upset because her mother-in-law had had a fall that morning and had broken her arm. I spent the remainder of the morning in the Chappell schools and at noon was met by Mrs. Brown and taken to the home of the lady with the broken arm. I expected to find her in bed with the whole household waiting on her. Instead she was around the kitchen with her arm in a sling directing the prepara - tion of dinner for a tablefull of boarders. I thought it was a plucky performance, especially for a woman rather past middle age. Deuel County ■'here is a new school building in Chappell, and it was needed, whole school situation has felt the influence of an up-to-date and it was gratifying to see the work being done there. Deuel is one of the smallest counties in the state and is not in a flourishing condition financially, consequently Mrs. Brown was not able to get an auto for our afternoon trip. Schools are a good ways apart out there and the roads were so poor we couldn't make very good time, but we got to one school four miles from town in season to see some of the work. This was the school in which I had seen Miss Davis two years before. She had a very small school, but people had moved in until sixteen children of all sizes were in attend - ance. The little house was in fairly good repair but the wall was very dirty. The children all seemed to be working well. Deuel county had just become self supporting. That is, while the districts are many of them pretty poor they have just enough income to make them ineligible to help from the state. They can't do much except what is absolutely necessary though. From this district we drove three miles east to another school reaching there a little after three, but the scholars were disappearing across the hills toward home when we came in sight. We looked in the windows and saw the home made furniture though, and the housekeeping of the teacher, and were right glad that we might start on our nine mile drive home. It was very cold before we got to Chappell, but we were soon warm over the nice hot register at Mrs. Brown's. After another good supper I went back to Julesburg and from there Saturday morning down to Sterling to spend Sunday with friends. Cheyenne County Monday morning early I was on my way back to Sidney to spend a day in Cheyenne county. Mrs. Stark, the county superin - tendent, was at the station to meet me, and all arrangements were made for a trip down the track to Lodge Pole. The chaffeur who was engaged in the first place, was waiting at the court house to tell us that he couldn't go, so there was a little delay while another ear </seg>
            <seg id="p156">was found. We were started in good season however and in a very short time were at district 164, where we found Mr. Slosson teaching. This district lies along the U. P. tracks and was well equipped with everything, Waterbury heater, and all modern improvements. Eleven pupils were in attendance, and we heard some good recitations. We did not stay long here, as it was the poor schools we wanted to see. Mr. Slosson's son, who attends high school at Lodge Pole, joined us here and we all crawled under the barbed wire fence again and went back to the car, which had gone up the road aways and turned around. The roads were giving us a hint of what we might expect if we got away from the beaten track. The snow was quite deep and where it was not packed by much travel, clogged the wheels of the car so we could hardly get through. Our next stop was at Sunol, a little town about a year old on the U. P. They have a fine new schoolhouse with proper light and nice furniture. There warn an organ but no shades at the window as yet. They will come in time. Miss Taylor was the teacher and she had fourteen pupils. Two little boys eight and ten years old come four miles straight north every day. The landlady at the hotel was gone that day but another woman Mrs. kindly arranged to give us dinner though she was nearly sick in bed with a headache. From here we went on toward Lodge Pole turning south just before we got there, and running down to a state aid school. Cheyenne county jn its early days was divided into districts to suit the convenience of the people rather than with regard to whether they would be self sup - porting after they were formed. We visited one of these little dis - ricts containing nine sections. There is another district just west of it of the same size and having the same financial difficulties. The proper thing for those two districts to do is to unite and make one well-to-do district, but so far they have resisted the efforts of all who have tried to presuade them to take such a course. There were twelve children in attendance, and they were working hard. From here we went back and into Lodge Pole where we had an opportunity to see a little of the work of all grades before dismissal. The spirit in this school is fine, a credit to Mr. Bostder, the superin - tendent, and to his teachers. BPheir motto is "Boost, don't knock" and it shows in all their Mrs. Stark's sister, Mrs. Wolfe, invited Mr. and Mrs. Bostder, Stark and myself to supper and we spent a very pleasant ng until train time, when Mrs. Stark went back to Sidney I went on to Kimball, on my way to Harrisburg and Scottsbluff. Banner County Superintendent Alden met me at the station and helped me get settled for the night. It was poor consolation to hear that the stage started for Harrisburg at seven o'clock and that it always went out promptly on time. It seemed like awfully early rising after the strenuous day just ended, but with the aid of the caller </seg>
            <seg id="p157">I was up, had breakfasted at the lunch counter and was ready to go at the appointed time. A little after nine the stage came to the P O. It was a bob sled already fairly well loaded, and by the time the big mail sacks for Harrisburg were added there was hardly room for the driver and me. The road for a mile or so out of Kimball was fine and we went along at a merry rate. Then we turned off the main road and trouble began. This was on Tuesday. On Sunday they had broken the road through the heavy snow, and it was not yet packed. The horses couldn't possibly trot much of the way and settled down to the walk of twenty seven miles into Harrisburg. Most of the time there was not a house in sight, just those snow covered hills as far as we could see in every direction, with the trail winding along like a dirty string, way, way ahead. The driver usually made the round trip in one day going over with one team and coming back with another but since the storm he had not been able to do that so he went over one day and came back the next, meeting a man on horseback, who carried a letter sack half way. He had no arrangements made for dinner at any house, but he had the keys to a homesteaders' cabin about half way over, where he fed the horses and said we could make coffee. It was about half past twelve when we got there, and the man with the letter sack was already there. "Floyd" the driver got out in the snow to unhitch his team and I saw it was inches deep so I refused to get out, and we all sat there in the bob sled, the men on the mail aacks in the back, and ate a lunch of crackers and cheese from sacks which Floyd had thoughtfully provided. The horses were given time to eat if they hurried and we were on the way again, down through Rock Hollow. As the sun got lower, the miles got longer and longer. Fortunately the day was not cold. It was half past four when we finally drove up to the hotel in Harrisburg. Seven hours for a twenty-seven mile drive. It was the most tiresome trip I have made so far. The landlady of the Swan hotel had gone to their ranch in the country and her place was being taken by two young ladies. They did the work and the planning very well, and it was no easy thing to do. I was given a room behind the dining room and beside the kitchen, a nice clean room, but there was no way to warm it and it got awfully cold before morning. Harrisburg exists, it seems to me, for nothing but to receive and send out the mail and provide food and sleeping quarters for the stage drivers. Six stages run out of the little town. The drivers are a lively bunch and keep things interesting while they are in town. The postmaster is a young woman, and I spent a very pleasant evening with her and Mrs. Belian in her cozy sitting room behind the P. O. Mrs. Belian is the county superintendent. She had come in fourteen miles on horseback to meet me that day. We saw her ahead of us for miles and guessed maybe it was she. She left home at eight o'clock, broke the road the first five miles, stopped an hour for dinner and reached Harrisburg about four o'clock. Poor Harrisburg is a pathetic </seg>
            <seg id="p158">spectacle. At one time it was a thriving prosperous town with two teachers and about one hundred pupils in school. Now one teacher looks after the thirty who are in attendance. I spent Wednesday morning visiting with Mrs. Belian in her office and visiting the Harrisburg school. It was out of the question to get to any country schools. The village school is taught by Miss Frye from Iowa. It is a hard proposition to keep all those children busy when school furnishes about all the diversion there is for them in the town. Banner county is living in hopes that some day a railroad will be put across from Kimball to Scottsbluff. It is a poor county. When the homestead land is all subject to taxation that will help matters, but it will need more than that to make it very prosperous. Mean - while the state is doing all it can to help. I left Harrisburg on the Scottsbluff stage with "Slim" driving, about two o'clock Wednesday afternoon. This time the conveyance was an open buggy with a trunk in the back. The baggage, mail, a stray man, "Slim" and I formed the load. The extra man sat on the trunk in the back and he certainly got good and cold before we reached Gering. The exciting part of the drive was going through the bluffs. The climb was straight up and then straight down on the other side. We went down with the horses at a sharp trot, kicking up the snow at every step. We went around turns so short that the horses were almost out of our sight. In places we went through cuts just wide enough for the wagon to go through. The single trees hit on either side. Now and then I caught a glimpse of an apparently bottomless slide over my shoulder as we went flying by. My hair would have stood straight up if there had been time to realize where we were before we were out and into something else. The seven o'clock whistle blew just as we drove up to che post office in Gering, and the state aid visiting for this year waa PROGRESS IN RURAL EDUCATION IN NEBRASKA By Edith A.

            <seg id="p159">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT that county high schools should be established in all counties where no twelfth grade high school accredited to the University is main - tained. At the present date sixteen such high schools are already opened or are in the process of construction or organization. An - other important piece of legislation has been the provision which made it possible for the amount of bonds to be raised from $1,000 to $2,000 in districts with more than 25 children, and from $2,000 to $5,000 in districts with more than 50 children. The limit as to per cent on assessed valuation in the matter of bonds was raised from The number of months school for state aid districts was increased from 5 to 7 months, and provisions were made for special needs in special districts coming under state aid provisions. The amount of twx to be raised by any school district in the state was raised from 25 mills to 35 mills. The so-called Shumway Act provided that high schools putting in proper equipment and maintaining an in - tensive course in agriculture, manual training and home economics might have associated with them certain rural schools providing such rural schools would give instruction in the above named in - dustrial subjects under the direction and advice of the city super - intendent of such agricultural school together with the county super - intendent. Last year nineteen rural schools took advantage of this provision and each received $50.00 state aid. On the whole this work was satisfactory to the school patrons. It was found that the better trained teachers handled the situation most effectively. The late publications issued by the state department of educa - tion that have made for educational progress include a Special Day Program of two hundred pages, graphically illustrated and arranged with order of days from Clean Up Day in September to the Closing Day Exercises in May. It contains appropriate songs, literature and suggestions for teachers. Another pamphlet issued in connection with the Shumway Act contains suggestions and outlines for industrial work in rural schools. A bulletin issued by Normal Training In - spector Gregory contains an outline on the course of study for the training of rural teachers in the normal training high schools. One hundred and seventy-six high schools in Nebraska were last year training young people for rural teachers. These schools enrolled last year about four thousand students. Normal training has done more than any other single agency to raise the standard of rural teachers in Nebraska. Certification bulletins and reading circle bulletins issued by the state department go into the hands of every rural teacher. These give rules and regulations governing the issuance of certificates and the pursuance of professional work. All rural teachers are required to do professional work. It is the policy of the reading circle board to put into their hands a book dealing with rural school problems. A school calendar lately issued gives plans for a model rural school house besides other valuable information. These </seg>

Observations in the field indicate an unusual number of new rural buildings constructed during the past year. Most of these have been scientifically lighted and heated.

In general this has been done where the county superintendent placed special stress upon the necessity and advisibility of such lunches. One of the best "signs of the times" in Nebraska is the general unrest relative to present rural school conditions. During the past year meetings have been held in many counties where county unit and consolidation was discussed. One entire day of the Farm - ers' Congress was given to a discussion of the rural school problem. The School Patron's Section of Organized Agriculture secured at their recent meeting Rural School Specialist W. W. Foght for an address. All over the state the farmers believe as never before that some change must be made in the rural school system. A commission appointed by the Governor is at work upon a revision of the present school code. This commission will submit to the coming legislature a revision of the present school law and a county unit measure, optional with counties, complete so as to make an entire system in itself. Other constructive work to be recom - mended by this commission will be some provision for teachers' pensions and the recommendation of a library measure directing county treasurers to withhold from the general school funds of each district the sum of ten cents per pupil as shown by the total number of pupils within each school district, said amount to be expended in library books.

Lathrop, Rural School Inspector i Published in part in the Independent Farmer, December 26, 19 IS. KWe have only to compare the system of schools found in our and towns to be convinced that the rural school is not making apid advancement that we see in the towns and that the country and girl is not given educational advantages equal to that of ity cousin. In most of the cities and towns of Nebraska we find modern and well equipped school buildings, normal trained and experienced teachers, efficient supervision, a course of study covering twelve grades and in many instances providing for instruction in manual and domestic arts, agriculture and music. These latter branches are in the better schools placed in the hands of especially trained super - visors. Because of the larger number of pupils in the towns there is developed competition, interest and enthusiasm. The grades feel the stimulus of the high school for which they are preparing. Ei the other hand most of the rural buildings in Nebraska are le box-car type of building, the teachers are inexperienced. ' under twenty years of age and seldom teach over two years, ne-roomed country school with its eight grades is the most t place for a teacher. It should be under the direction of the aid and best qualified service. Instead we take the youngest lost inexperienced of the profession and give her the most t task. She practically works out her own salvation. If she makes good the town offers her a better salary, fewer number of grades to handle, freedom from janitor work and exposure, an easier chance to find a boarding place and increased social advantages. Thus, just when her services are the most valuable to the rural com - munity she leaves it for the town. If some trouble arises in the town school the teacher has the advice of her supervising officer at once while the rural teacher must wait weeks and sometimes months before she can have a talk with her county superintendent. I re - member upon one occasion of visiting a beginning teacher in one of the isolated rural districts. This little teacher hurried to me while I was hitching my horse, with the exclamation "0! I am so glad you came. I cried almost all last night over the trouble I am having here." It happened that I came while her trouble was fresh and if not of any help was at least some consolation. But how many more times did it happen that I was not near at the right time. The public school is the only institution to give its most difficult problem to the inexperienced. The county superintendent's field is so large and the duties so complex that direct supervision is at the best meagre. It is impossible to visit the schools often, so much supervi - sion must come through circular letters and that at the best is only absent treatment method. </seg>
            <seg id="p163">BETTER RURAL SCHOOLS The teacher in town centers all her energy upon one or two grades while the rural teacher often has from six to eight grades and the impossible task of hearing twenty-five classes a day looms up before her. The course of study cannot be as broad as that in the town because of the already crowded program, and worst of all the one-roomed country school offers no inducement to the child for a broader and higher education. The fourteen year old boy often finds himself alone in his classes. This means no competition and Ion of interest. There are not enough children for a lively ball game. No wonder this boy loathes school. Some advance has been made in the rural school, but it is in no wise commensurate with what has been done in the cities and towns. What has come has been in the general improvement in the architecture of many of the new rural buildings, scientific heating and ventilating plants, a better equipment and higher educational qualifications of the teacher. Every school district has its "big boy" who by irregular attendance finds himself at seventeen years of age ranked as a "fifth grader." Rather than recite with the grade to which he belongs he will not go to school. These boys who formerly went to school a few months in the winter to study just arithmetic, spelling and history are not found in the rural schools now. The cities are taking care of this class of students by their special schools and many of the towns offer special courses in manual art?, agricul - ture and business for this class of young people who for various reasons have lost step and find later what they have missed. These unfortunate country boys and girls should have a like chance in the rural school. They should be cared for without being subjected to the humiliation of those who have fared better than they. A man can stand the abuse of his fellow men better than a boy can endure the jeers of the gang. I 'he free high school law has been the means whereby hundreds ys and girls in the rural districts have had the chance for a ' education. It works well for the pupil near enough to drive s towns, but is not effective for the pupil who must board in in order to go to high school. The average child of from ? to eighteen years of age needs the protection of the home roof. PSo far as being a social center in the community, the rural ool has actually lost ground when compared with the days of the I ling school, Sunday meeting and grange. Social recreation is only a necessity for young people but for adults as well. There tendency for farmers to live a life of sameness and monotony. parks, theaters and crowds of the towns are drawing country dren away from the farm. Why not make of the rural school a al center? It is the people's institution. It is being done in es where they have the consolidated school. Money for rural schools is not spent advantageously. It is not uncommon to find a rural school with an enrollment less than ten, </seg>

The county unit basis is being championed by some of the leading educators as a solution of the rural school problem. An excellent bulletin entitled "The Status of Rural Education in the United States" by A. C. Monahan gives some interesting statistics relative to this and kindred systems in other states. It can be secured by writing the Bureau of Educa - tion, Washington, D. C. Just so long as children in the rural districts are housed in box - car buildings, with cross lights and ill ventilation, and subjected to the most inexperienced of teachers; just so long as their is inade - quate supervision; just so long as there are scores of boys and girls in every county in the state who are not even completing the eight grades, much less receiving a high school education; and just so long as we are spending more money per capita for this meagre in - struction in our rural schools than we are spending in our best graded schools, we must admit the need of better rural schools in Nebraska. RURAL SCHOOL LETTERS. U. S. Bureau of Education A REMARKABLE RURAL SCHOOL Bhe first school in Hall county, Nebraska, was a private school , four pupils attending. One of these was subsequently killed i Indians. The school was regularly organized under the state laws in 1868. Wm. Stolley was elected director in 1872 and served forty years until his death. Most of the credit for this remarkable school is due to Mr. Stolley. A fine brick building with porches and architectural ornaments and containing library, cloak room, and coal room besides the regular school room, was built in 1886 at a cost of $2,257.53. The teacher's residence was built in 1894 for $1,000 in gold. </seg>

It contains seven rooms, two halls, a cellar, closets and screened porch. The house is kept in good repair. An acre of ground is devoted to the teacher for garden purposes. The present teacher, Mrs. Theresa Sullivan, has taught in this school for ten years. She is a very excellent and progressive teacher, holds a life certificate and keeps her school as well classified as a city school. The pupils learn well and are kept interested in their studies. Besides the regular elementary work, German is taught. During the warm days, school is occasionally held out doors under the shade of the beautiful trees. Iome of the more recent improvements in this school are a •bury stove, ideal adjustable desks and seats, a teacher's desk, rnicke book case and a sand table. The lower walls are covered green burlap, the floor is oiled and there is nothing lacking to this school a really model school except the lighting which is three sides. ■rhe school is located about a mile and a half south west of the limits of Grand Island. The present school officers are Mr. Hagge, Mr. Fred Timpke, and Mr. August Becker. Khe assessed valuation of this district for 1913 was $211,785, vy 5 mills, census list 71, enrollment for 1912-13 forty-five, t enrollment 40, salary of teacher $70 and house rent free. The district provides a Christmas treat and Christmas presents for the pupils every year. Dorothea Kolls, County Superintendent. Grand Island, Nebr, Feb. 5, 1914 RURAL SCHOOL LETTER NO. 13 What a One-Room School is Doing in Industrial Education I 'he school in District No. 40 was the first rural school in Adams y, Nebraska, to do systematic work in domestic science and ilture. This is a one-room school, about four and one-half from Hastings. It has no better equipments nor surroundings the average rural school. In many respects it is not as well ped as many other schools. The beginning of the work in domestic science was the out - growth of an industrial county teachers' institute, held in the county during the last week of August, 1912. Nothing was offered at that institute but agriculture, manual training, and domestic science. In preparing for the institute, the county superintendent purchased a workbench and complete set of tools and a kitchen cabinet. On the closing day of institute a spelling contest was held and these articles were awarded to the best spellers. The teacher in District No. 40 won the kitchen cabinet. Late in the fall the teacher and larger girls began to lay plans </seg>
            <seg id="p166">Sork in cooking. The pupils furnished the material, and under iacher'8 directions prepared a number of articles of food. Dur le cold weather they prepared soup or an oatmeal porridge for lunch. They also baked bread, cookies, cakes, etc. This work 11 done by the girls under the guidance of the teacher. One of the pleasing features of the work was the fact that the school was able to overcome the objections made by many people concerning the teaching of the subjects in school, in that no time was taken from the regular school hours. The pupils did the work before and after school and at the intermission periods. This year the same objection is not advanced. The school is still doing the work as in the previous year and has also added sewing to the course. They now give a part of three afternoons each week to this work — time taken during the school hours. The work in sewing is especially interesting. The pupils keep notebooks of all their work. They write up their notes at the close of each lesson and fasten in their notebooks the work they are doing, so far as they can. This includes samples of fancy and plain patch - ing, the various stitching, hemming, darning, etc. The complete articles, such as plain and fancy aprons and plain dresses, are taken home and used as finished. fhis spring the pupils are studying elementary agriculture with her work. A great deal of it will be experimental work, such i testing of seeds, testing the water-holding capacity of various a study of soils, testing of milk for butter fat, study of plants, The school has a kitchen cabinet, a three-hole oil stove with oven, a set of dishes, and various utensils necessary to carry on this work. Other equipment will be added from time to time. The people of the district are interested in this phase of school work as much as they are in the book part. It will act as leaven not only in the community but also in the county. It means the beginning of the introduction of some practical phases of school work to supplement the work in books.

It is near the lake region of the sand To get an idea of the magnificent distances in that state, you i know that Cherry county is four and a half times Rhode 1 in area. The territory belonging to Simeon includes a radius er ten miles. The writer of this introduction to the principal story of this article had the honor of being the orator of the Day at the Fourth of July celebration at Simeon for 1913. He takes pleasure in testify - ing to the high moral character, intelligence and progressive spirit of the people of this community. The celebration was held in the grove on the ranch of Mr. P. H. Young who is a graduate of the Agricultural College, the University of Missouri. There are several college graduates living on ranches in this community. One ranch - man and his family came to the celebration in his automobile. Only three years ago it was thought impossible to run an automobile in the sand hills. Several other ranchmen came in fine carriages, some came in wagons and some on horse back, some coming twenty miles. We had a parade — thirteen girls dressed in patriotic colors to repre - sent the thirteen original states. Uncle Sam and the Goddess of Liberty were in evidence. An equal suffrage group was in the pro - cession, an old-time company of callithumpians, then the citizens. And the eagle screamed with all his might. The dinner! It would have done credit to Delmonico's or the Waldorf-Astoria. The cul - inary skill of the housewives of Simeon will rival that of our beat The social and intellectual life of this neighborhood is due to Mr. and Mrs. P. H. Young and Mr. and Mrs. Sam Hudson. As already stated, Mr. Young is a college graduate. He has about 20,000 acres in his ranch. His ambition when a boy was to raise white-faced cattle. His toys were white-faced cows and calves. He now counts his white-faced cattle by the thousand though he has tasted misfortune. The awful blizzard in March 1913 — the worst since 1888 — cost him hundreds of his best cattle. But he is an optimist and always looks on the bright side. What an inspira - tion such a man is to any community when misfortune comes. Mrs. Young is a talented woman who taught school in Cherry county before she was married. Mr. Hudson is a native of Kentucky. He has lived on his ranch for over thirty years. His word is as good as a gold bond. He has a little private lake of about 500 acres stock - ed with choice fish. Mrs. Hudson before her marriage was Miss Lulu Kortz, a graduate of Grinnell College of Grinnell, Iowa. For several years she was county superintendent of Cherry county public schools. On her trips over the county in school supervision she often would travel 240 miles in ten^days and visit only ten schools. One </seg>
            <seg id="p168">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT of the State Junior Normal schools is located at Valentine. It was the custom of Mr. Hudson to give an annual banquet to the faculty of this school at his bachelor headquarters on his ranch. It is around the banquet scenes at this sand hill ranch that the romance which led to the marriage of Mr. Hudson and Miss Kortz is laid. Their home has all the modern conveniences of a city residence. It is a beautiful place in one of the valleys of the sand hills. THE WOMAN'S CLUB The following story of the Woman's Club of Simeon is told in Mrs. Hudson's own language: "This club was organized about two years ago just because it is natural for women to visit. The ranch business necessitates the homes being widely scattered and that makes domestic help hard to keep. Ranchmen are usually so well to do that their daughters do not need to work out and imported help grows lonely and longs for the 'giddy whirl of society' or else marries some strapping young cowboy and sets up her own household. At any rate few of our women have competent help and family cares and distance keep them from exchanging visits with their neighbors. The men often meet at round-ups, brandings and dehornings, and the cravings of their social nature are satisfied. Someone has said: 'The sand hills are good for men and dogs, but a mighty poor place for women and "The men of our community first saw the need of more social life for us and suggested that we form a club with an all day session once in two weeks — but there were the children. Possibly a mother might get four or five small children ready, drive five or six miles through pasture gates and over ranges of sand hills, keep her children out of mischipf in new surroundings, spend the day and get home in the evening fairly rested, but if fifteen or twenty women each took her family the hospitality of even a ranch home might be somewhat taxed. There seemed no way until one of the husbands said that he for one would be willing to take the entire care of his five children for one day in each two weeks if the other fathers would do the same. The experiment has worked, the men have come to know the pretty ways of their own children, and some of the mothers have known a free day for the first time in ten years. "Each woman takes her sewing bag and we do the work planned by the hostess — card wool, piece quilts, make comforts, aprons, dresses, darn stockings, embroider towels, hem napkins, crochet bands of trimming — anything and everything that the varying needs of our homes require. The hostess prepares dinner. Sometimes it is bass caught in a nearby lake, or wild ducks or grouse or maybe a wild goose, or strawberries or early vegetables — whatever sportmanship, or gardening skill makes possible. We have no officers and no dues. Anyone is a member who is a neighbor. The meetings circulate </seg>

The mothers come home with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes ready for the next day's duties. Even a rubber shoe, you know, will wear longer for occasional periods of relaxation. Often a good story is read, or some article describing a new household convenience. We discuss everything of common interest except our neighbors word of gossip has been heard up to date. I The attendance varies from twelve to twenty-five. We are ling known as women who cook well, entertain easily and make amilies comfortable and happy. Lately the young girls have ized a similar club. I suppose the idea of working at our ngs came from the fact that many women could not spare ay and the time to get the extra dinner if her work was piled be done afterwards. "Anyway the plan has just worked itself out according to our community needs. I do not know how it would transplant. The thing that has held it together is the normal desire of every woman for the companionship of other normal women." COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS By Robert I. Elliott, Deputy State Superintendent The first county high school law of Nebraska was passed by the legislature of 1905. Under this law, it was left optional with counties which did not have twelfth grade accredited schools already established, whether or not county high schools should be estab - lished. The law required one-hundred freeholders to petition the county board to call an election for the purpose of voting on the establishment of the county high school. If a majority of the voters at the special election voted for such high school, then it was the duty of the commissioners to proceed to establish such school. I "he optional county high school law was introduced by Hon. Epperson of Fairfield, Nebraska, senator from the twenty - senatorial district. The bill passed the legislature of 1905 the emergency clause and became a law April 5th of the same The sole purpose of this law was to provide high school itages for the youth of the sparsely settled regions in western iska, where twelfth grade accredited schools were not already ished. The following extract from the 19th biennial report of Superintendent McBrien, published in 1906, gives a synposis of the t'S. F. 376, by Epperson of Clay, (Duplicate of H. R. by Farley of Hamilton.) This measure enables counties tablish and locate county high schools; to call a special </seg>

Emergency." The first school to be established under this law, was in Kim - ball county, Nebraska. This school was established the first year the law was in effect, and has made a steady growth since that time. At the present time, the Kimball county high school has twelve grades and is accredited to the University of Nebraska. Bhe following is a statement in regard to the school, contributed perintendent R. E. Truax: "Kimball County High School "Organized in 1908. Has grown steadily in attendance, equipment, school spirit and co-operation. Enrollment each year is as follows: 1913-1914 69 1914-1915 89 "Three instructors were employed when school was firs organized at an average salary of $77.00. Four instructors •re now employed pt an average salary of $98.11. It is the plan of the board of regents to add a fifth instructor nex year. "Value of equipment when organized was $600.00. It is now approximately $2,700.00. In addition to the $2,700 equipment the school has a new gymnasium which cost $2,457.00. The money for the gymnasium was raised through the efforts of the study body and practically all of the work was done by the manual training classes. The cost of the manual training equipment is $520.00 ($400.00 added this year). The cost of the sewing equipment is 909-1910.. 910-1911.. 911-1912 . .31 ...40 . . ..48 912-1913 . . . .57 </seg>
            <seg id="p171">COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS $280.00. Through the county high school and the county superintendent's office, manual training and sewing arr being introduced into a great many country schools. t"A splendid demonstration farm is maintained. Last ear, eighteen acres were farmed. Thirty-four various crops ere grown." This was the first high school established in Kimball county. A little later, the school at Bartlett was established in Wheeler county. This school has only ten grades, but is gradually improving. The county high school law was amended slightly by the legis - lature of 1911, but even then, very few counties took advantage of the law and established county high schools. The legislature of 1913 passed a compulsory county high school law, making it com - pulsory for counties to establish county high schools, where twelfth grade accredited schools were not already established. This bill was introduced by Hon. Fred Hoffmeister, representative from Chase county, and was passed without the emergency clause. The law, therefore, took effect in 1914. This year, the law affected sixteen counties, for there were just sixteen counties in the state which did not have county high school? or twelfth grade accredited schools. All of these sixteen counties have not complied with the law. Only seven of the sixteen have established county high schools. Many of the counties which did not conform to the law, did so on the ground that the law was un - constitutional. A test case was brought in Logan county to test the constitutionality of this law, and the case was tried before Judge Grimes of the thirteenth judicial district. Judge Grimes declared the law unconstitutional on the following grounds: First, because the title did not express the contents of the old high school law of which the new law was an addition. Second, because it is clearly inconsistent with the act of 1905, that is, it, in effect, repeals part of the act of 1905 without mentioning the sections repealed, or mentioning sections amended. The following is a copy of the judg - ment in the case: ■the District Court of Logan County, Nebraska, i H. Worrell, Plaintiff vs. ■E. F.

The judgment in the will affect only the counties in this judicial district, the thir - i. The case of course, was decided upon legal technicalities, and it is supposed that the county high school law will be so amended at the next session of the legislature that the law may be constitu - tional and will affect all the counties that do not yet have a twelfth grade accredited high school. The following counties have organized county high schools in conformity with the compulsory county high school law: Arthur, Chase, Grant, Hayes, Keya Paha, Kimball, Perkins and Thomas. The counties which come under the provisions of the law, but which have not established high schools are as follows: Banner, Blaine, Deuel, Garden, Hooker, Logan, Loup and McPherson. Piince these schools are only in their infancy, it is difficult to :t what far-reaching and beneficent results may come from them they reach mature growth. However, the success already at - 1 by the Kimball county high school is a good index of what be expected from the remaining schools. There is an opportunity for these schools to render great service to the people. In time, dormitories may be erected in connection with these schools, for the boys and girls from the country districts. In this way, expenses can be greatly reduced and at the same time, a social center established. A farm also could be maintained and the products sold to defray the running expenses. EThe course should be planned to meet the needs of the people that locality. Emphasis should be placed on the teaching of culture, manual training and domestic science. In some states, great emphasis had been placed upon such schools. In the state of Kansas, in thj year 1911, 395,054 boys and girls attended the county high schools. In the state of North Carolina, a bonus is offered to county hifh schools that reach certain standards of efficiency. The sug - gestion has been made that the state of Nebraska might offer the same incentive </seg>
            <seg id="p175">STATE FAIR EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT THE STATE FAIR AND EDUCATION Taken from the Middle-West School Review, October, 1914 Can you imagine any greater fun than to lead into a big show ring, before several hundred people a Shetland colt three weeks old, and so small that a man could easily lift it in one hand? And can you imagine anything funnier than that same colt starting to run, and dragging its young master, who was only about six or seven years old, about the sawdust? This was one of the amusing and interesting scenes in the live stock show ring at the Nebraska State I Nebraska has just closed a fair which shows its many-sided dustries, and depicts in a most interesting way the creditable work ing done in educational lines. Ks customary to speak of the state fair as an educational m, and so it is. Viewed from outside or the standpoint of or, it is a liberal education and every man and woman who ibly do so, should attend. But they are not the only ones. arent should consider it their duty to take to the state fair y and girl who is of sufficient age to appreciate it. Teachers much in arousing interest in this. They are the ones who ; to gain the benefit and help from it. The small boy above referred to is only one of many who were interested in the pony exhibit. There were several boys helping exhibit, and as the owner of this large string of ponies said, "They could be better shown by trained men, but the boys like it, and the learn and it helps them." There was another young exhibitor i the hog building. The young boy, still in his teens, was there wit his hogs. His father, who is an expert hog-man, had every reaso to believe that the boy would not get any ribbons, but he knew th boy was going to learn something from the experience and so it was worth while for the boy to go through the experience of managin his own exhibit. Here is an example of practical education. The school exhibit, arranged along the west and south walls of the agricultural and horticultural building, was very interesting. This new building is one of the most beautiful to be seen on any fair ground, and the position given the school exhibits was extremely fine. Because of the skylight it was possible to examine with perfect ease all of the work done. The exhibits were of the usual sort specimens of penmanship, drawing in ink, charcoal, crayon and water color; booklets; and much industrial and some manual training work. Of course, these were all judged by competent judges and prizes awarded, and most of this was well deserved and showed much originality on the part of the student. B'here were some rather interesting exhibits, which, while they ot take prizes, attracted attention. There was one interesting y of booklets on seeds. Inside was the story of the seed, on the </seg>
            <seg id="p176">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT Ewas a water color sketch of the plant, and attached to this, ribbon, was a small bottle containing the seed — a very good nation. Many collections of woods were shown. One, by a Lincoln boy, showed the bark of the wood, with one end of the stick cut so as to show a half-section displaying the grain and heart. West Lincoln sent in a very attractive crayola exhibit. A water color exhibit which attracted much attention was that from a Rockford school, t charge of Miss Grace Young. It was certainly very remarkable, d especially interesting because picked up at random by the county perintendent on a hurried visit. From this same county there was a good exhibit of outline maps. The penmanship work throughout the state was very good, showing the success of the present method and it must have been very hard for the judges to choose from among so many good specimens. The exhibits of manual training work were, in some instances very good. There were others, however, which frankness compel us to say were very poor, showing that the time was really wastec and that the boy's idea of art and worth while stuff was not bein correctly directed. If we are going to do work of this sort, we shouli have both artistic and practical methods, and the inartistic and ugl should not be allowed. There was not as much work from either th manual training or domestic science departments as there migh have been, and it is to be hoped that another year these two branches of our school organization will be developed, and larger exhibits We cannot refrain from mentioning an exhibit which attracted much comment and sent a little thrill through the heart of each one, as they thought of the poor little ones who had so little in life to encourage them, but had sent in their work from the Nebraska Ortho - pedic Hospital. It was remarkable, was really worth while, and deserved special mention. The University had expended much time and thought and brought to a special building, reserved for it, not only a fine exhibit of the work of its several departments, but a most efficient and courteous corps of attendants. All questions were kindly and pleas - antly answered, and when one was tired, there was no better place to go than to the moving pictures prepared and described by Professor Condra. Nebraska's resources, and the benefit of expert knowledge, were here set forth in a most entertaining way. Parts of this exhibit were shown at a number of county fairs and people who could not get to Lincoln also saw the good work being done by Nebraska's greatest educational institution. KPhere is no one enterprise in which more people are interested in the state fair. It is something of which we may be justifiably i, and we hope that when the next comes, the weather may be a little better, and that everyone will be there, to see what is ; done and take pride in the products of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">STATE FAIR BOYS' SCHOOL ENCAMPMENT THE STATE FAIR BOYS' SCHOOL ENCAMPMENT By F. E. King, Boys' Secretary , Lincoln City Y. M. C. A., in charge of Encampment. In 1913 the Nebraska State Fair Board decided to conduct a Boys' School Encampment in connection with the State Fair. Mr. E. Von Forell of Scottsbluff was made Superintendent, Mr. Pugsley and Mr. Bradford of the State Farm were made responsible for the educational work and the Boys' Division of the Lincoln Young Men's Christian Association directed the general camp activities. ft selection of two boys from each county, one representing the ill town and one the rural communities, was left largely to the nty superintendents. Each delegate paid five dollars registration and in case his railroad fare exceeded $5.00 round trip, the state inded the balance. Thus it cost no boy over $10.00 for his camp school work for the week. Ninety boys from the ages of 14 to years attended in 1913 from fifty-five different counties. Kesides the school work in agricultural subjects and the camp ies the boys were used as ushers in the amphitheatre by shifts afternoons and evenings. A glimpse of the daily schedule will uite a good idea of the nature of the camp: 6:30 A. M. Reveille — Setting up Exercises 7:00 A. M. Breakfast. 7:45 A. M. Tent Inspection. 8:00 A. M. Assemble in dining hall for first lecture by some member of the State Farm Faculty or a trip to some pavilion for a study of live stock or farm machinery Four class periods extending to 11 A. M 11:15 A. M. Dinner. 12:00 M. One shift on duty at the amphitheatre for the afternoon. The rest of the boys free to play baseball or volley ball about the camp, to visit the fair or to take a trip in a bod; under the direction of the Camp Leaders t points of interest in Lincoln, to the Stat Farm or to the Y. M. C. A. for a swim — trip most popular with the boys. 5:15 P. M. Supper. 6:15 P. M. Another shift on duty at the amphitheatre for the evening program. 10:00 P. M. (After fireworks). Assembly at camp for camp- fire program of songs, stories, and life prob- lem talks. 10:30 P. M. Taps. Kbe camp was organized by tent groups with a mature leader of I character, selected by the Y. M.

            <seg id="p178">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Ei, in charge of each group of fourteen boys. One of the features of the camp was the spirit of friendly competition ry developed among the tent groups. The success of the 1913 camp led to its continuation in 1914 under the same organization and plan but with the additional equip - ment of a large wire-screened building for the dining hall and kitchen. One hundred boys from fifty-three different counties, ranging from the ages of 14 to 20 years, were enrolled in the 1914 encamp - ment. No boys were permitted to attend who had been in the camp the previous year. In spite of the extremely wet weather the en - campment was a real success. The success of the two years will doubtless mean that the Boys' School Encampment will become a permanent feature with permanent equipment of the Nebraska State Some of the features of the camp which meant most to the boys were: ■ The lectures on practical problems in scientific agriculture e State Farm professors. The boys eagerly absorbed what ven them and their eyes were opened to the greater possibilities r farm life. KThe trips to the exhibits, to the State Farm and different ries of Lincoln. 3. The experience in handling crowds received from ushering in the amphitheater. Many of the boys were very awkward at first but soon developed the ability to handle the crowds efficiently. El. The privilege of enjoying the camp spirit and good fellowship, boys learned to sing "The Smile Song" at the camp fires and it one night when some people might have relieved their feelings me other way while the rain poured down and the wind blew ent over. Friendships were established among these boys from fer Nebraska which will mean much in years to come. 5. Many boys have spoken of how much the association with their camp leaders has meant to them. They were men who appre - ciated the potential value of these boys of the farms and gave this week out of busy lives simply for the opportunity of touching those lives with their personality and giving them a vision of the real mean - ing of life. Many boys left with the determination to carry back to their own communities the things they gained at the encampment.

            <seg id="p184">IN MEMORIAM IN MEMORIAM Mrs. Emily Kent Manville P'.n. Emily K. Manville was a familiar name to teachers of ska during the '80's, the '90's, and until 1905, when she re - her position as principal of the Crete high school, after eighteen of most faithful and efficient service in that capacity. Emily Kent was born in 1835, and at the age of sixteen, an orphan, she taught a rural school. With the funds obtained from teaching she was able to graduate in the class of 1857 from Kimball Union Academy, Meriden, N. H., a preparatory school for Dart - mouth College. She taught in that school and later she was prin - cipal of its ladies' department. During the civil war she taught in the Academy at Waukegan, Illinois, where in 1865 she married one of her pupils, Mahlon J. Manville, and went with him to Shelbyville, Missouri. There she opened a private school for boys and girls who had known none of the restraints of the schoolroom during the four years of the civil war. Two hundred of her Missouri pupils re - membered her with anniversary letters and flowers thirty years after she left them. She came to Nebraska in 1881, and her husband's failing health caused her to resume teaching. She taught in Doane Academy from 1882 to 1885, in the grades of the Crete city schools from 1885 to 1887, but from 1887 to 1905, as principal of the Crete high school, she did the work for which she will be longest remembered and will always be held in the highest esteem in Nebraska school circles. Each pupil with whom she came in contact was to her a soul com - mitted to her charge, and she fulfilled that trust to the utmost of her powers. She died October 28, 1914, at the home of a son in Beatrice, and was buried at Crete. The picture of Mrs. Manville used above is a copy of a life sixe portrait, a tribute from the alumni, which was unveiled with appropriate cremonies in the high school room, Crete, Nebraska, May 29, 1914. The inscription on the portrait is "To Thine Own Self Be True' MRS. EMILY KENT MANVILLE, Principal of Crete High School, 1887-1905. W. K. Fowler, in the Nebraska Teacher. December, 1914. One of the highest privileges of my educational experience was to be associated with Mrs. Emily K. Manville at Crete for seven years of the time that she was principal of the high school. It was a great pleasure to work with her because of her loyal and cordial support. It was a revelation of the power of a personality to witness her work in the classroom and in every phase of school life. She </seg>
            <seg id="p185">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT was a remarkable instructor, giving every topic the magic touch of inspiration. Keeping fully abreast of educational thought and pro - gress, her splendid preparation, rich experience, and mature judgment rendered her a most valuable member of the teaching corps. Her deep sympathy with young life not only bound the pupils to her with an affection that was the life of the school but also reacted upon her, keeping her young in spirit. This was the secret of her wonderful influence in school and community. Her work remains; and her memory is safe in the hearts of the many whose lives she has so richly blessed. A. A. Reed, in the Nebraska Teacher December, 1914. Irs. Emily Kent Manville was a woman of noble ideals, a r of rare ability, a friend to all who knew her.

B. Fairchild his long and important service with the institution. Former pupils gathered from all points of the compass to show respect and affection for Professor Fairchild. His two sons, Fred and Hal, were present from New Haven. Two of the speakers of the evening, President Carroll G. Pearse and Raligh S. Rife, each left his own commencement exer - cises to be present, the one from Milwaukee and the other from Princeton University. Prof. J. S. Brown, who came to Doane in 1882, presided over the meeting. Rev. W. A. Tyler made the open - ing prayer. The Adelphian Quartet sang "Still, Still with Thee" and with Mrs. Lillian Chase House "Hie Thee, Shallop." Carroll E Pearse spoke on Professor Fairchild as the early students knew i, Raleigh S. Rife on Professor Fairchild as the later students w him, C. B. Anderson on Professor Fairchild as the man and ten, and Charles C. Smith on Professor Fairchild as the trustees w him. Mrs. May Bennett Avery, '91, read a group of letters appreciation received from friends who could not be present at celebration, and Miss Annette Abbott of Lincoln, a relative of family, sang beautifully the song "Roses" written by Mrs. rchild and set to music by Prof. W. I. Andruss, who was director the conservatory from 1897 to 1901. Mr. Smith in closing asked </seg>

D. This was a complete surprise to Professor Fairchild. After a few characteristic words from Dr. Fairchild, in cap and gown, the Aldephian Quartet sang the hymn written by Prof. A. B. Show, '82, of Leland Stanford Junior University, and set to music by Prof. R. L. Dick, '04, especially for the Adelphians. The fifth and sixth verses of the hymn were built around the voice of Cord Aller. The audience then adjourned to the first floor of the Science building, where a reception was held, giving people an opportunity to shake hands with Dr. Fairchild and congratulate him. ■ur Babbitt Fairchild, A.

SAFETY FIRST Iiteam and electric railway companies have within the past or three years taken extra precautions to prevent accidents, ddition to installing mechanical appliances for safeguarding employees, they have attempted to educate the public as to responsibilities. In this campaign for the public safety they adopted the now familiar slogan "Safety First." Placards and is — paper, cardboard, and brass — are posted everywhere, a con- I warning to the careless and heedless. At the beginning of this campaign, the Union Pacific Railroad authorities consulted with the state superintendent concerning a placard to be placed in the school houses along their right-of-way, and as the result of that conference posters like the one accompanying this article were printed by the railroad company, framed, and placed in all school houses in their territory. These cards are four - teen by twenty-two inches in size. In the lower left hand corner is the letter from the state superintendent, as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p187">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT To the Teachers and Pupils of the Schools of Nebraska: In bringing this matter to your attention the railroad Eimpany is endeavoring to enlist your co-operation in less - ling the number of injuries which occur annually to men, omen, and children while trespassing on railroad property. till you not do your part toward the prevention of such cidents and warn others of the danger of trespassing. James E. Delzell, State Superintendent of Public Instruction." In the lower right hand corner is the following statement by the railroad company: "This bulletin is published in the interest of the thous - ands of school children living along the line of the Union 'acific Railroad, in view of the fact that 25,000 young &gt;eople under eighteen years of age have been killed or seriously injured while trespassing on the tracks of railroads n the United States in the last ten years, and in an effort o greatly reduce or entirely eliminate this unnecessary loss of life, for which the railroad companies are in no way re - sponsible and over which they have no control. The co - operation of everyone is necessary in making this effort successful and is therefore most earnestly requested. Union Pacific Railroad Company." EAs a further precaution the railroad company issued the two etins given below. If the people generally will co-operate with transportation companies, they can do much to reduce unneces - ' accidents and loss of life. It is much to be desired that teachers pupils do their share to bring about this attitude of mind which ;s toward "Safety First." James E. Delzell State Superintendent. UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY BUREAU OF SAFETY ARTICLE NO. 1 To the Public School Authorities: The following will be accompanied by a printed bulletin which you are respectfully asked to hang up in a promi - nent place in the school-room, and to periodically bring it to the attention of the pupils and to explain its purpose, if they •re not able to understand its meaning. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">Once a month we expect to send you an article on the Dangers of Trespassing, to be read and explained to the children, believing that the schools are the proper place to educate the children, the future citizens, along these lines. Will you not give us your co-operation in carrying on the work in order that this dangerous practice may eventually be eliminated. To the Pupils in the Public Schools in the State of Nebraska: tin this age we hear much of conservation or the preserving loss or injury, of our many resources such as mineral, table and animal products. National reserves have been established to protect our forests from being eliminated, laws have been made to protect birds and beasts from be - coming extinct, due to useless slaughter, much has been said relative to economy in the use of coal, iron, etc., in order that they may be available for use in years to come. In the last few years efforts have been made to con - serve the greatest of all resources, human life. Peace con - ferences are held with a view of eliminating war and its consequent loss of life. Industries are taking steps to protect employees from avoidable accident and injury. Railroads b spending thousands of dollars annually to protect the and limbs of their patrons, employees and the public •neral. One of the greatest sources of death and injury which occur on railroads in this country is that of trespassing on the property and tracks of the railroad companies. Tres - passing according to the dictionary means, "To enter un - lawfully upon the land of another" or "To violate any recognized rule of duty or social life." Therefore to enter upon the property of another, without permission, is tres - pass. Between the years of 1900 and 1912 inclusive, 103,566 persons were killed while trespassing on railroad property in the United States, and this is more than half of the persons killed on account of railroad operation, from all causes, in that time. In the last twenty years over 25,000 young people under eighteen years of age have been killed or seriously injured while trespassing on railroad property, enough to make a milestone for every mile of travel in a trip around the world. In nearly every town there is some child without an arm or limb which has been lost trespassing on the railroad, or in the cemetery a grave of some child killed while playing or walking on the railroad track. It is gen - erally thought that trespassers consist mostly of tramps and hoboes. This is not the case. Records show that children, </seg>
            <seg id="p189">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT in a great many cases, are among those who use railroad property as a public thoroughfare and a playground. In most foreign countries, where railroads are in opera - tion, laws have been made which prohibit trespassing on rail - roads under a heavy penalty, and therefore, few persons in - dulge in this dangerous practice, and as a result, few, if any, persons are injured in this manner on foreign railroads. Therefore, what is more necessary than putting a stop to the trespassing on railroads in this country, and it is to this end that this appeal is being made in an effort to aid in the conservation of the greatest of all resources — human life. This can be done by always remembering the follow - ing warnings: DON'T walk on railroad grounds, tracks, or bridges. DON'T loiter or play about stations or cars. DON'T jump on or off trains, cars or engines. DON'T crawl under, over or between cars for any purpose. K ALWAYS STOP! LOOK! AND LISTEN! for approach - trains when crossing over railroad tracks. »You owe it to yourself, your parents and your friends always remember this, and you are urgently requested to trespass on railroad property for any purpose, and use your influence to prevent others doing so.

In order that all who come under its provisions might understand the re - quirements, both .for original certification and for renewal, some one from the State Department, usually Miss Anna V. Day, visited each fall the fifty-three city school districts affected by the law, and met the teachers, in groups and individually, and explained any points not clear. Few regulations seemed to be hazy and these were included in a circular letter sent out to city superintendents under date of October 14, 1913, as follows: October 14, 1913 To Superintendents of Article 21 Schools: Below please find some points regarding the requirements for city certificates. If you will bring these requirements to the atten - tion of your teachers it may forestall inconvenience and embarrass - ment when their certificates expire. ■. All work required to clear up an emergency certificate be completed at the November examinations, November 21-22. 2. Credits in List A subjects must be earned by passing the state examinations. No school credits will be accepted in these subjects. 3. All teachers holding supervisor certificates must meet the requirements in reading circle work. 4. Outlines for the thesis for the professional certificate may be secured from this office. 5. A second grade certificate is renewed by passing examination in the reading circle work and in one subject leading toward a higher grade of certificate, or by passing the examination in reading circle work and in securing at least five hours' credit in not more than two subjects by attendance at summer school. 16. A first grade city certificate is renewed by keeping up the ing circle work each year the certificate is in force and taking examination in it one year, and earning passing grades in two ;cts leading toward a higher grade of certificate, or by doing reading circle work as above and earning satisfactory credits tight weeks' summer school.

A number of teachers failed to grasp the significance of the requirements for the renewal of their first and second grade city certificates and did not take the neces - sary examinations, especially in the reading circle work, so emergency certificates were issued them, qualifying them for work until the results of the November examinations could be ascertained.

Elliott, Deputy State Superintendent Since there has been but very little change in the general system in the certification department, it is not necessary to give an exten - sive report. There is less objection to the plan of the state examin - ing board each year. Superintendents and teachers are generally in favor of the plan when they see that it places all teachers on an equality in matters of certification. Comparatively few mistakes have been made in the matter of records by the certification depart - ment, when the great amount of work recorded is taken into con - sideration. Superintendents and teachers are to be congratulated upon their loyalty and co-operation in making this department a E'he one new feature in connection with the department is the iuction of the reading circle examination. Reading circle nations were given for the first time in the year 1913. Two ir examinations were given, the first in April and the second ay, and a special reading circle examination was given in the i of July. Some objections were heard at first to requiring </seg>
            <seg id="p198">Iiere to pass examination in reading circle work, for renewal of Scates. There were some who felt that the requirement was much for the re-issuance of certificates. Now, however, since teachers have become accustomed to this examination, little a objection is heard. On the other hand, superintendents feel teachers are giving more attention to the reading circle books read them more carefully than heretofore, since they are re - el to pass examination in them before their certificates can be re-issued. In the year 1913, examinations were given on McKenny's K Personality of the Teacher," and Foght's "The American School" for country teachers, and McMurry's "How to and Teaching How to Study" for city. In the year 1914, examinations were given on Carney's "Country Life and the County School" and O'Shea's "Everyday Problems in Teaching." It is necessary for teachers to obtain a grade of 70 in order to have their certificates renewed. In addition to this, credit is given in certain subjects, to teachers who pass these examinations. No fee has ever been charged for the reading circle examinations provided the candi- date has paid the regular examination fee. The total number of reading circle papers in the two years of Iiennium is 10,848. This includes reading circle examinations e re-issuance of both county and city certificates. It is not ary for each teacher to take the examination in reading circle each year. Teachers are required to pass examination in read - rcle work only one year during the life of the certificate. This that about one-half of the teachers will be required to take examination each year. There has been a gradual increase in the work of the depart- ment. The total number of papers read in the biennium just closed (January, 1913 to October, 1914) is 153,337, including the 10,848 reading circle papers. The total number of certificates issued for the biennium is as follows: Total 10,504 Parts of the state still demand the emergency certificates, as well as the third grade:, and permits. Some counties, however, will not permit any teachers to teach who do not hold at least second grade county certificates, with credit 527 first grade county certificates, with honor 444 r irst grade county certificates, plain 634 .econd grade county certificates, with credit 1,093 lecond grade county certificates, with honor 219 lecond grade county certificates, plain 6,220 ?hird grade county certificates (only one class) 1,073 'ermits 29 Emergency certificates 265 </seg>
            <seg id="p199">grade county certificates. All counties would, indeed, be pleased to do the same, if teachers so certificated could be furnished. PA few recommendations for the work of the department are order at the present time. One recommendation is that a more careful check should be made on the part of county superintendents in reporting certificates to this office. It has been possible for teachers to teach in certain counties of the state without the knowl - edge of the state department. Of course, it is hardly possible for the state department to keep a check upon such teachers unless a report is made by the county superintendent to this department. I would suggest that the county superintendents be more prompt in reporting certificates. Some county superintendents have not handed in reports for two or three years. We have urged time after time that these reports be sent in, but we are unable to get them. It may be necessary for more stringent rules to be made in this regard. There hts been a noticeable co-operation on the whole, between the county superintendents and this department in the matter of certificates, and the system is generally satisfactory. Examinations were given in every month of the year with the exception of Sep - tember and December in the years 1913 and 1914.

            <seg id="p241">NEW SCHOOLHOUSES Much had been done during the past four years in the w constructing up-to-date schoolhouses in both country and city, modf rn in construction, with approved plans for heating, lighting, seating, and ventilating. Many towns and cities have buildings that do them great credit, and it gives us pleasure to include in this report cuts of a? many as- we were able to secure. Should any school district contemplate the erection of a new schoolhouse in the near future, much information may be secured by studying the cuts and the table of information included here. I feel ?ure that any board of education would be pleased to furnish additional data on request. While towns and cities have probaoly made the greatest advance - ment in building and equipping modern school buildings, many county superintendents have made enviable records for themselves and their patrons. Especially is this true of Superintendent Hannah C. Johnson of Boone county. Through her kindness we include cuts of some two or three of her new rural school buildings with floor floor plans accompanying. Mi?s Johnson was a member of the county superintendents' legislative committee, which in 1913 en - deavored to secure the passage through the legislature of S. K which reads as follows: "Section 11587. They shall purchase or lease such site for a schoolhouse as shall have been designated by the district, in the corporate name thereof, and shall build, hire or purchase such schoolhoase out of the fund provided for that purpose, and shall make sale and conveyance of any site or other property of the district, when lawfully directed by the qualified voters at any annual or special meeting; Provided, That the qualified voters of the district may appoint a building committee to let contracts for and take chargf of the work of building such schoolhouse; Provided, further. That no schoolhouse shall be built and no schoolhouse ?hall be re - modeled until the plans and specifications for such new school houst or remodeled schoolhouse have been approved by the state superin - tendent of public instruction as to heating, lighting, seating and ventilation. Any school district failing to comply with the require - ments in the last proviso shall forfeit its share of the following semi - annual apportionment of state school funri- I regret that it failed to become a law, but Miss Johnson's work upon that committee prepared her for good work in her own county. As you will gather from the tabular matter concerning rural schoolhouses, a number of other county superintendents have also accomplished much, and it is a matter of regret that we were unable to secure more definite information concerning their buildings. </seg>

            <seg id="p248">COMPARISON OF NEBRASKA TOWN AND RURAL CHILDREN COMPLETING THE EIGHTH GRADE EXAMINATION IN JULY 1914 The question is frequently asked, "Which does the better work the pupil in the town school or the one in the rural school?" It is generally agreed among educators that the results show a decided advantage on the side of the town school. There are, probably, no definite statistics on this subject in Nebraska. In fact it is some - what difficult to find a standard by which to measure the rank of efficiency. One test is a comparison of the ranking between town and rural children completing the eighth grade examinations. It was with this object in view that blanks were sent to all county superintendents in Nebraska early in the summer of 1914 asking for information on the points indicated in the following table. It will be noted that the report is incomplete for some of the counties. On some of the items the report gave "totals" but failed to differ - entiate between "boys" and "girls." It should be remembered in comparing the results that Lincoln, Omaha, South Omaha and mist of the schools in cities organized under Sub-division XXI, follow a course of study of their own rather than the Nebraska State Course of Study, and so are not included in the reports made. The state eighth grade questions are based on the Nebraska Course. The results of the tabulation show that 10,040 children completed the eighth grade examinations last year; that the girls out-numbered the boys by 1,050; and that the total number of children from the rural districts wag 5,680. Since the reports were incomplete, the exact number of boys and girls from the towns and rural schools could not be ascertained. On individual highest rank, 31 counties reported a rural school pupil, 53 reported a town or village pupil, one county reported a tie between a town and rural pupil, and eight counties reported time was not taken to figure out the highest average. To the question, "On the whole which ranked higher, pupils from the towns or the country?" Twenty-one counties reported rural schools, 53 counties town schools, 14 the same for both the rural schools and the towns, and 5 counties failed to report the item. Ene interesting feature of the tabulation was that 2,879 more completed the state examination in 1914 than in 1913. Of ,161 pupils completing the examination in 1913, 4,042 were ling high school in 1914. </seg>

            <seg id="p281">THE USE OF THE BIBLE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS By James E. Delzell An address prepared for the Epworth Assembly, Lincoln. Nebraska. Aucust When a small boy, some ten or twelve year? of age, I road a book known as Dix's Works, published about 1849. In that I found a little poem, one of Lord Byron's. I never committed it, but the general thought of it stayed with me, and last night I went to my library and looked through it until I found this particular poem, which reads as follows: Within this awful rolum The mystery of myxterie. O, happiest day of human rmet To whom our God has given grace To hear, to read, to fear, to pray. To lift the latch and force the way. But better had they ne'er been born Who read to doubt or read to scorn Written on fly leaf of Lord Byron's Bible. A great tribute U the Book of Books. Another poet speaks in no uncertain words his faith in the stability of the writings of the Bible, as follows: ' The proudest works of And reason's brightest The Sophist's art, the Shall sink in darknesi But Faith triumphant genius shall decay luster fade away. Poet's boldest flight and conclude in night; over Time shall stand Shall grasp the Sacred Volume in her hand, Back to its source the heavenly gift conrey. Then in a flood of glory melt away." Anonymous Henry Sabin, former state superintendent of Iowa, pays the following tribute to the Bible: "Every teacher should include the Bible among th books with which she should be acquainted. I say nothing of it here as a religious book, but simply as a book of whose literature no teacher can afford to be ignorant. Neither do say anything of its use in the schoolroom. In that you MM be guided by the laws of the state, the rules of the board and by your own judgment of what is best. But its precept are at the foundation of all moral training in school, and o allrightlivinginlife. The excavations of buried citiesin the Eas are proving that its history is in the main reliable. Its page </seg>
            <seg id="p282">ontain the loftiest poetry, the purest code of morals, the eepest philosophy of any book in existence. Without the trength and influence which come from the Bible our civili - ation could not endure for one generation. My advice to eachers is not alone to read the Bible, but to study it, that hey may be ready to explain reference made to it in any branch; and above all to emphasize its teaching in the very-day life of the school. Its maxims, its precepts, its &gt;oetry may be taught and infringe upon no man's liberty f conscience. They must be taught if our children are to ive in a Christian civilization." The above stanzas and paragraphs give a few thoughts that show the feelings of men who know the value of the Bible in mould - ing the characters of men and women. It is also necessary in this discussion that I include here a few words defining and describing the use and work of the Book of Books, as agreed upon by men of all nationalities and faiths: BThe Bible is an encyclopedia of religious, moral and ethical ht of a long series of years in the development of the human nt, associated and allied with the divine." "Within its pages are to be found the underlying principles of the individual life and activity: on its pages are written the founda - tion thought that guarantees a sacred home, insures the family bonds; from cover to cover are written words of advice to the nation, which if followed guarantees an undying reign, but if not followed the nation exists a short time and passes away so that another nationality a little more closely allied and united with the "Elements of a true Nationality' may be given a chance to demon - strate the gospel truths of the Book of Books." P" Within this volume are given the essence of scientific geology, ronomy, biology, history, biography, autobiography, literature, all science and art. ' ' Ehen should not the child the source of sources hit ation to all other life? be given an opportunity to learn elemental knowledge of life and Arthur Henry Chamberlain An Essay in Modernism," says: in his "Ideals and Democracy "The public school, if it be true to its mission, ma&gt; not devote itself to sectarian teaching and the inculcating of particular religious tenets. Those parents who desire th education of their children to be colored by doctrina teachings will certainly place their boys and girls in pa rochial or church schools or denominational institutions o learning. They will not expect the public school to compe the avowed Hebrew child to sit under an exposition o Methodism, the Catholic to accept even passively the Mo hammedan doctrine, or the agnostic to be steeped in Univers </seg>
            <seg id="p283">alism. Particular secular or religious beliefs should have no place either directly or indirectly in the course of instruc - tion in the public schools. "But even though we agree with this high authority on the teaching of religion in the public schools, should the state take no account of the moral training of the youth? Is it the business only of the church and the home to carry forward this moral training, and have the public schools no responsibility here? If the bishop is thinking of religious training in terms of sectarianism or creed, then we should agree with him that such teaching has no place in the public schools. The schools exist not for theological but for the most complete educational ends. So far as charac - ter building is concerned, that is a different matter. We shall venture the assertion that the principal excuse the public school has for existing today is that it may be a center of moral instruction. KNOWLEDGE MUST BE BASED ON AN ETHICAL FOUNDATION EOur educational fathers were sound in their doctrine 'Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to i government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged' Or - dinance of 1787, organizing the Northwest Territory i understand that the use of the word 'religion' here is not intended to be taken in any narrow sense, as indicating an 'ism.' Knowledge is necessary, but it too may be secured at home, or at church, or out of school, in whatever capacity the individual may be placed. Knowledge without a strong moral directivity, without an ethical foundation acting as a dynamic, is often more to be avoided than desired, and he Chas the former without the latter may become the most gerous sort of criminal. t"The school, you say, for intellection and the home the church for morality. To place upon the church and home the duty of inculcating the principles of moral living, and to intrust the duty of such proper instruction to ministers and fathers and mothers is not enough. Time was when moral teaching took place largely in the home. The home life was a community life. The home was the center of the family. There were fewer congested cities than now. Social and industrial conditions were vastly more simple than they are today. Children are now reared in apartment houses and tenements, and in stifling cellars and garrets. The manifold duties of fathers and mothers separate them constantly from their children, and the latter simply are allowed to 'grow' as was Topsy. The increased desire for wealth and the get-rich-quick spirit of the day render parents </seg>
            <seg id="p284">careless of their duties in the realm of moral instruction. The very atmosphere of this century of faster living makes the problem ever increasingly complicated." Kr. R. Fulton Cutting, President of the New York Association iproving the Condition of the Poor, in a recent address spoke &gt;ws: "Organized co-operation between the church and public school teachers will materially increase the influence anc mportance of each in the community in forming a mora sense in the plastic minds of the community's youth. Every where, through school committees, the pastor and his people should get in close touch with teachers, principals, and dis - trict superintendents of the public schools, to study modern methods of education, sanitation in the schools, the adaptation of the curriculum to meet the needs of the community, am work for the introduction of manual training, elementary agriculture, and domestic science. At present machine methods of education with no regard for individual capacities or defects of children are responsible for much of the crime n the country. "There are 19,000,000 children in the public schools o this country, receiving no direct religious education. Fo five hours a day they are in touch with their teachers and under the teachers' influence. Once a week, less than 1 pe cent of these children go to Sunday schools, which attemp to make up for the lack of moral education in the publi schools; but too often the methods of pedagogy used in these Sunday schools are archaic and obsolete, the practica methods of teaching in the public schools being there un known. The church exhausts itself in efforts to reclaim th youth whom it has neglected." Addressing the session of the Federated Catholic Societies at Milwaukee August 11th, Archbishop Ireland declared: "The evil today in America is the decay of religion and, in necessary sequence, the decay of morals. In botl instances the cause of the decay is the enforced secular ism of the state schools. Others than Catholics, heedfu observers and intelligent thinkers, admit the evil, admit th cause and give the alarm." Speaking further of secular schools the Archbishop said: "Not against state schools as such do I raise objec tions, but as to the method in which they work — methods that, whatever the theory be, do in fact consecrate secularism as the religion of America and daily are thither driving America with the floodtide of Niagara. "Somehow, I claim, secular knowledge must be imparted to the child so as not to imperil its faith in God and in </seg>
            <seg id="p285">Christ. Prove to me, I say, that this contention does not fully fit into the Constitution of the United States; that in making it I have not in mind the welfare, the salvation of America — prove this before you call the contention un- American if not anti-American." The editor of Educational Foundations, comments on this address of Archbishop Ireland, and says: "This eloquent pronouncement is worthy the consider - ation and endorsement of Protestants as well as of Catholics. With such breadth of view and with such ardent patriotism as here expressed the Archbishop, we conclude, would not consider the parochial school, valuable as it may be to his own communion, the solution of the problem he presents. Only the spiritualizing of the secular school can meet the contingency, and for this purpose good Americans can afford to distinguish between what is essentially sectarian and what is fundamentally religious." Our schools are so cosmopolitan that our national constitution prohibits our public money as a nation being spent to promulgate olitical or sectarian ideas or beliefs in our public schools. Hence le great question to be decided nationally is, "Is the Bible a ectarian Book." If it is, then it should be discarded from our public schools." If it is not a sectarian book, is not used to pro - mulgate any "sect" such as Protestantism, Catholicism, Moham - medanism, Mormonism, or any of the many other "isms" co-existing n our land, but is used as a moral, ethical guide for good citizen - flip, is used as a book for information reference in the sciences. rt, literature, history, then it should have a place in our public chools. !A few reasons why the Bible has not been uniformly used in le public schools are worth noting. When the colonists left the Id World they did so that they might enjoy religious and political eedom. The New England States were settled by members of the hurch of England, Virginia the Church of England, Rhode Island y the Baptists, Maryland by the Catholics, Pennsylvania by the uakers, New York by the Dutch Reformed, and Georgia by the Methodists. Many of these people had undergone religious per - secution, and when they settled in the New World were more or less intolerant. The Puritans, or New England settlers, persecuted the Baptists and drove them from their boundaries, and they estab - lished their church in the little state of Rhode Island, giving religious freedom to all. The Puritans likewise persecuted the Quakers and drove them from their boundaries. The V'irignia colonists persecuted the Catholics and even followed them into their own colony and endeavored to take their territory trom them. We find that the R&amp;Dtists of ft h o rf p Isl&amp;nd t hp Qu&amp;kcrs of Ppnnsvlvunin t h(* C At hoi i cs </seg>
            <seg id="p286">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT of Maryland, and the Methodists of Georgia, gave religious and political freedom to all classes of people in their territory. These colonies were organized on a broad basis. Permitting without preju - dice settlers of other faiths than believed in by themselves to locate within their boundaries, they established cosmopolitan communities. Their code of law to be followed generally contained a statement similar to this: The Constitution of this state prohibits sectarian instruction in the schools maintained at public expense. This state - ment has been copied by many of the newer states of the Union, and the word "sectarian" by some is interpreted to mean "the reading of the Bible in the public schools," by others to mean "religious instruction by different churches." As the word "sec - tarian" is generally interpreted to mean "a religious body with par - ticular belief, peculiar holy ideas different from other organizations," to keep down strife it is generally thought best not to infringe on these rights. So to read the Bible for the purpose of instilling into the minds of pupils the peculiar belief of any church organiza - tion would be a wrong use of the Bible and objections often arise to the reading of the Bible because in the interpretation of the same the reader and interpreter bring? out his own particular view. This would be in direct opposition to the general idea of religious free - dom and a free public school system. The reading of the Bible for the purpose of making better citizens is within the province of the public school as held by the supreme court of Nebraska and a majority of other supreme courts ot the United States. I heartily approve of the reading of the Bible in the public schools for the intellectual and moral uplift of the pupils. I sent a list of questions to the Commissioner of Education, P. P. Claxton, Superintendent William Davidson of the District of Columbia, and to the several state superintendents of public instruc - tion. From the replies received, I gathered these facts: The Bureau of Education has no publication on the subject of reading the Bible in the public schools, but Commissioner Claxton states as his belief that the Bible is not a sectarian book. The reading of the Bible is prohibited in four states; by law in Minnesota, by a ruling of the attorney general in the state of Washington, and by decisions of the supreme courts in Illinois and Wisconsin. There is no law or literature bearing upon the subject in twenty states: Arizona, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mis - sissippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming, but the reading of the Bible is quite common in Maryland, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Tennessee. The following three states have laws providing that "the Bible shall not be excluded from the public schools": Georgia, Indiana, Iowa. Sectarian instruction is prohibited in nine states: Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah, but the Bible is quite generally read in </seg>

In the District of Columbia and the state of Massachusetts the law requires that the Bible shall be read daily without note or comment; and the legislature of Pennsylvania has passed a bill requiring the daily reading of the Bible in the public schools of the state. EPhe above is a summary of the reports from forty-three states, )istrict of Columbia and the U. S. Commissioner of Education, those who are interested in a more extended report of the $ of the matter in the various states, I append herewith the s written by the chief state school officers of the United States: United States Bureau of Education "I find that the Bureau of Education has no publication on the subject of reading the Bible in the public schools. Personally. I can see no objection to having the Bible read in the public schools. I have always believed that it should be read very much in the same way as other good literature is. Rightly used, the Bible is not a sectarian book; it is literature of the very highest moral value. I do not believe that there should be any attempt to teach sectarian religion in the public schools of any of the states of the I T nion " P. P. Claxton U. S. Commissioner of Education June 17, 1913.

California E"Our Attorney General has ruled for many years that our stitutional provisions against sectarianism in the public schools vent the use of the Bible in any way. This is a cosmopolitan state, including every sect and cult in the known world. It is not Eible to find common ground on any matter relating to religion our only safety is to religiously avoid it in the public schools, h are for all." Edward Hyatt, Superintendent Public Instruction. June 16, 1913. Connecticut BThis state has not produced any literature relative to the g of the Bible in public schools. BThe reading of the Bible is entirely within the control of local officers. There is no statute on the subject. F'ln all of our large cities there are private schools, generally siastical schools. Parents desiring their children to have relig - instruction can send to these schools. The reading of the Bible in public schools cannot do harm "My own view is that this reading may be and generally is a positive good influence." Charles D. Hine, Secretary State Board of Education June 16, 1913. Georgia "We have very little literature upon the subject of reading the Bible in our public schools.

Idaho KThe Bible is not read in our public schools. Section School Laws reads as follows: 'No books, papers, tracts or documents of a political, sectarian, or denominational character shall be used or in - roduced in any school established under the provisions ol his Chapter, and any and every political, sectarian, or de - nominational doctrine is hereby expressly forbidden to be aught therein; nor shall any teacher or any district receive any of the public school moneys in which the schools have not been taught in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.' " Many of our school authorities interpret this to mean that scriptural reading is prohibited, although this is not necessarily so. Many of our teachers use the Bible in their English work, assigning sections for study from a literary point of view. I think it is to be regretted that so great a book should not be studied as a master - piece and for literary interpretation; a book that has had a greater influence than any other should be read. No place can a student find such beautiful figures of speech as in the Bible." Grace M. Shepherd, Superintendent Public Instruction. June 24, 1913.

These differences constitute the basis of some of the peculiarities of faith and practice that distinguish Catholicism from protestantism and make the ad - herents of each a distinct Christian sect. But the fact that the King James translation may be used to inculcate sectarian doctrines affords no presumption that it will be so used. The law does not forbid the use of the Bible in either version in the public schools; it is not proscribed either by the constitution or the statutes, and the courts have no right to declare its use to be unlawful because it is possible or probable that those who are privileged to use it will misuse the privilege by attempting to propagate their own peculiar theological or ecclesiastical views and opinions. WHERE THE COURTS MAY INTERVENE "The point where the courts may rightfully intervene, and where they should intervene without hesitation, is where legitimate use has degenerated into abuse; where a teacher employed to give secular instruction has violated the constitution by becoming a sectarian propagandist. That sectarian instruction may be given by frequent reading, without note or comment, of judiciously selected passages, is, of course, obvious. A great modern philosopher —per - haps the greatest — has said the persistent iteration is the most effective means of forcing alien conception upon reluctant minds. Whether it is prudent or politic to permit Bible reading in the public schools ia a question for the school authorities to determine; but whether the practice of Bible reading has taken the form of sectarian in - struction in a particular case is a question for the courts to deter - mine upon evidence. I It cannot be presumed that the law has been violated; the d violation must in every instance be established by com - t proof. The value of the common schools as disseminators of ledge and social levelers is well understood and justly appre - 1; and there is little likelihood that the people will ever per - heir usefulness to be impaired by sectarian controversies. LITTLE DISCORD IN SCHOOL "When we consider that this is the first case of its kind ever presented to this court for decision, we feel assured that neither teachers nor school boards have been much inclined to bring discord into the schools for the chance of securing by indirection a slight sectarian advantage. But, if the fact were otherwise, it could not in any way affect our conclusion. The section of the constitution which provides that ' No sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school or institution supported, in whole or in part, by public funds set apart for educational purposes, cannot, under any canon of construction with which we are acquainted, be held to mean that neither the Bible, nor any part of it from Genesis to Revelation, may be read in the educational institutions fostered by the state. </seg>

I am afraid, however, that when the question is brought up as a matter of funda - mental law, that the use of the Bible in the public schools cannot on that basis be defended. Much as I regret it, I am of the opinion that the recent decision of the Illinois court was eminently sound. In the Eastern states at least, we have further got to recognize the fact that a very considerable element in the body politic is not Christian at all. I refer, of course, chiefly to the Jews, but other non-Christian religions are coming to be represented.

Moreover, I believe that the benefits of reading of the Bible in the public schools may be over emphasized as so little time is usually devoted to reading the selections and allows little opportunity for making an impression upon children's minds. I have observed, also, that the reading of the Bible secures very little interest and attention on the part of the children and it has been my observation that the impression which a lesson from the Bible makes even upon an adult mind, depends largely upon the ability of the reader in interpreting the passages. ■ We have had some efforts made in this state to secure the ig of thf Bible in the public schools, but I have urged the im - ve necessity of not raising this question until several other important school problems are settled."

R. C. Stearnes Superintendent of Public Instruction. June 19, 1913. Washington KThe only literature we have on the use of the Bible in the schools is the opinion of a former attorney-general as follows: "'The stated reading of the Bible in the public schools of this state is a religious exercise within the meaning of the constitution, and as such is thereby prohibited in section 11, article 1, of that document '" A. C. Nelson </seg>
            <seg id="p305">" My personal opinion would be that the informal reading of the Bible in the public schools, without comment, would be of great value; and would not contravene the letter or the spirit of our constitutional restrictions. I do not favor however, the required reading such as Pennsylvania seems to have adopted." Assistant State Superintendent of Public Instruction. June 17, 1913. West Virginia "I think we have no available literature on the subject of the use of the Bible in the public schools of the state. The qu&lt; has not been agitated to any extent. The custom has been to read the scriptures for opening exercises, though this custom is not universal. For the coming year I have designated the Old Testament as one of the books for our teachers' reading circle, and I hand you here - with a copy of the 'statement made in connection with that an - nouncement." M. P. Shawkey State Superintendent Free Schools. June 14, 1913 Wisconsin ■The supreme court has passed on the question of the reading i Bible in the public schools of this state and decided ry to the constitution of Wisconsin. Since the decision of 'My decision to designate the Bible as one of the primary texts of the state reading circle is based upon my conviction that it is studied the least and understood the most imperfectly of any of the great history making books of the world. There is perhaps no book to which more frequent reference is made by all civilized peoples but the references are usually haphazard and unscientific. It is quoted by men everywhere but the quotations are fragmentary and in many cases are wrenched from their setting and distorted in meaning. The Sunday Schools which do the greater part of all the Bible teaching that is done at the present time, as a rule do not make either a systematic or thorough study of the Bible. Parts of books and chapters are taken up and scanned hastily, a few illustra - tive notes given and some morals pointed, but the average child going through the process comes out without any adequate idea of the whole compass of the book or without any mastery of the book as a whole. I am convinced that from the standpoint of ethics, lit - erature and pedagogy that a thorough study of the Bible will be worth more to the teachers of this state than any other volume that I could name at this time, and I, therefore, designate it as one of the reading circle books upon which teachers will be examined for the renewal of certificates in 1914.

            <seg id="p307">AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOLS THE SHUMWAY ACT 1 he late superintendent Jackson said in his biennial report for li*00 that the three subjects upon which educators should give immediate attention were manual training, agriculture and domestic economy. In this report he quotes an article on "Domestic Science" written by Miss Herberta Jaynes of Omaha who visited the Oread Institute at Worcester, Massachusetts, for the state department of education. Former State Superintendent Fowler, during his administration, was instrumental in securing the passage of the law requiring teachers holding first and second grade county certificates to pass an exam - ination in agriculture. At that time there were very few available text books on this subject in existence. In order that the teachers might prepare themselves to meet the requirements of the law. Mr. Fowler asked Drs. Bessey, Bruner and Sweezey, of our State Uni - versity, to prepare an elementary text on the subject. He sent a copy of this book to James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture at that time. Secretary Wilson's reply is found in Mr. Fowler's bien - nial for 1904, from which the following sentence is quoted: "I do not happen to know of any superintendent o public instruction who is doing this work as well as you are doing it. You have taken a sensible course; you have gone to the doctors in your state university and had them prepare something for young minds; and it required the united work of three great men to do it." I'ormer State Superintendent J. L. McBrien selected his deputy. . Bishop, to work out a scheme of agricultural and industrial tion for elementary schools. Mr. Bishop's contribution along ine during his service as deputy and later as state superintend - as been of great value to the state. In the biennial for 1910, Bishop recommended to the Governor that a bill be passed ling state aid for industrial education very similar to the one discussion. Eirmer State Superintendent Crabtree made provisions in the city ation law whereby special supervisor's certificates could be i teachers who have completed courses in agriculture, manual g and domestic science from recognized special training schools. This continuity of ideals on the part of our state administration for the past fourteen years represents an unbroken line of progress in the history of industrial education and indicates how the way was paved for the passage of the "Shumway Act," the most impor - tant educational measure of the Nebraska Legislature during its thirty-third session. This measure provides state aid in high schools </seg>
            <seg id="p308">maintaining a somewhat intensive course in agriculture, home econom - ics and manual training, and carries with it a provision whereby rural schools associated with these high schools, and giving instruction in the industrial subjects named, may receive state aid not to exceed $50.00 per school. The bill was introduced in the Senate by Herbert P. Shumway, Chairman of the Educational Committee of the Senate, and a representative of the sixth senatorial district. Mr. Shumway has resided in Nebraska more than thirty years, is a farmer and a graduate of the Minnesota State University. His bill was modeled somewhat after the Minnesota law which provided state aid for agricultural and industrial training in high schools. The other members of the committee on education from the senate were Walter Kiechel of the first district, Nathan P. Dodge, Jr. of the fourth district, Philip H. Kohl, of the seventh district, and John Robertson of the twenty-fourth district. Before presenting the bill to the senate, Mr. Shumway went over the draft in conference with the legislative committee of the State Teachers' Association. The bill as it now stands on our statute books is practically intact as it came from the conference of this joint committee. An appropriation of $15,000 for the biennium was made for state aid and inspection and supervision of these schools. In the summer of 1913 nineteen high schools in the state made the requirements necessary to be designated as "Agricultural 8 Schools under the Shumway Act." These schools were as 's: Alliance, Alma, Aurora, Blair, Crete, Fairfield, Gothenburg, ngs. Holdrege, Kimball County High School, O'Neill, Pawnee Red Cloud, St. Paul, South Omaha, Stromsburg, Tecumseh. o and York.

Delzell, State Superintendent. SUGGESTIVE PLANS FOR THE AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL FARM Kiuggestive plans for the school fields of the agricultural high Is and other schools which have fields for agricultural demoti - ons, tests and experiments. The plans are considered under eight main headings, as follows: Section A - Fertilizer Tests. Section B — Crop Rotations. Section C — Continuous Cropping. Section D — Crop Museum. Section E — A Few Simple Tests With Crops. Section F— Cultural Field Studies. Section G-The Orchard. Section H — Family Garden. Section I — Pathological Demonstrations. E,lthough the majority of the schools will rind it advisable to the fields in order that each of the main headings or portions if is represented, yet it is quite probable that some may be d to entirely omit one or two of these sections. SECTION A FERTILIZER TESTS Ehe object of the fertilizer tests is to demonstrate the im - lce of organic matter, humus and nitrogen, in crop production rmal Nebraska soils. Plan No. I </seg>
            <seg id="p325">I. Laying Out of Plots: The one acre which is to be de - voted to tests with farm manures, crop residues and commercial fertilizers, should be permanently laid off into plots, each one-fifth of an acre in size. EH. Treatment: After the fertilized acre is carefully laid out, y good farm manure to Plot No. 2, at the rate of 8 to 12 tons acre, and if wheat straw is to be used in the experiment, apply &gt; plot No. 5 in such thickness that it will cover the ground it one or two inches in depth. Disk all plots thoroughly, after h plow at a uniform depth of from four to eight inches. The should then be harrowed. To plot No. 3 apply commercial fertilizers as follows: Steamed bone meal at the rate of 300 pounds per acre, and potassium sulphate or potassium chloride at the rate of 300 pounds per acre. Plot No. 3 should then be disked, and in order to prevent any difference in treatment, the other four plots should also be disked at this time. Just before seeding, apply dried blood at the rate of 100 pounds per acre, and harrow the entire acre as well as the plot receiving the application of dried blood. Bt this operation two weeks later, and again in another two until dried blood shall have been applied at the rate of 300 s per acre. AH tillage operations should be the same on all for reliable results from the different fertilizer treatments. ■II. Method of Applying the Commercial Fertilizers: ' all fertilizers broadcast or by the use of a drill. The fertilizers i be scattered over the land as uniformly as possible. IV. Alfalfa or Straw: If alfalfa be used as indicated in the ng of Plan No. I instead of straw, the plots should be so placed Plot No. 5 falls on an alfalfa field. This alfalfa plot may then owed and treated as the check plot. The crop yields on the i land may then be compared with those on each of the other plots. g. Check Plots: Plots No. 1 and 4 are to be reserved as plots and will receive similar treatment as the others except do fertilizers or applications of any kind shall be applied to Comparisons can then be made of the yields on the fer - ; and unfertilized plots. ■VI. Data: All data should be carefully collected and recorded uture reference. </seg>

            <seg id="p330">ABC SECTION B CROP ROTATIONS It is intended to demonstrate the importance of rotating in the vicinity of the school by conducting a series of crop rotations on the school farms. The more thoroughly the demonstrations are performed, the more effective will be the results. Suggestive Rotations. The following rotations are suggested: I. Non-legume Rotation. The rotation consists of corn, oats and wheat. Three plots are to be devoted to this rotation in order that each crop may be grown every year. III. Legume Rotations. Each school should strive to demon - ■ate the importance of a leguminous crop in a system of crop tations. The following are suggested: a. Clover Rotation. This one may consist of clover, corn, oats and wheat. Each kind of crop to be grown every year and consequently four plots of ground will be required for this rotation. b. Alfalfa Rotation. This rotation will probably be the most important one for the vicinity in which the school is located. Twelve plots are necessary for this rotation as in- dicated by the following order: Alfalfa, alfalfa, alfalfa, alfalfa, corn, corn, oats, wheat, corn, corn, oats, wheat. kit may be desirable to use sand vetch, cow peas, soy beans, or eet clover as the leguminous crop in the rotation for some portions the state. III. Some of the schools may desire some other practical crop in the rotation, in order to better demonstrate the needs of the vicinity in this respect. For instance, a rotation in which potatoes are one of the crops, may be suggested. IV. The following rotation is suggested as probably the most feasible one for a large number of the schools. It is completely planned and drawn up, since the majority of the schools may find it necessary to use it in preference to any of the others here men - tioned. ROTATION PLOTS </seg>
            <seg id="p331">Nebraska rotations should include a legume for restoring nitrogen to the soil. In the greater part of the state, alfalfa is undoubtedly the most profitable legume. In that part of the state where alfalfa is a profitable crop, at least three plots should be maintained to show its influence on other crops. One crop is rotated continuously with staple non-leguminous crops. In eastern Nebraska, corn, wheat and oats should probably be chosen. In the western part of the state, potatoes should unquestionably be included. This gives each year a comparison of some crop in a non - leguminous rotation with the same crop in a leguminous rotation. Clover, sweet clover, or vetch might be used instead of alfalfa, the other crops in the rotation being arranged so as to give comparative yields. The alfalfa might be left only three years, and only one crop of corn be raised. The agricultural teacher in making his selection of rotation, should be governed by the crops which are raised in his community. In a county where the acreage of winter wheat is large, and that of corn is small, corn should be raised only one year, while the wheat should be raised twice in succession. In order to show satisfactory results the rotation should be continued over a considerable number SECTION C CONTINUOUS CROPPING It is advisable to devote a small area of the land to purposes of continuous cropping in order to better show the benefits of rotat - ing crops, especially when a leguminous crop is used in the system. It is suggested that a small tract of ground be cropped continuously to corn. Some schools may desire- to have plots producing other crops continuously, such as wheat, oats, alfalfa, etc. rhe I foil llowing is suggestive A for eastern Neb B brask ka cone ditions: 914 915 916 917 918 919 Corn Corn Oats Wheat Corn Corn Corn Corn Oats Wheat Alfalfa Alfalfa Alfalfa Alfalfa Alfalfa Alfalfa Corn Corn 920 921 Oats Wheat Alfalfa Alfalfa Oats Wheat </seg>

The following are suggestions for the arrangement of their l?nd into plots for demonstrational purp&lt; Notes Concerning the Diagram of the Experimental or Demonstrational Plots of the School Ground. A I. The land for school purposes should be as level as pot and yet have good natural drainage. II. The soil of such land should be approximately uniform in each of the following factors: a. Texture. b. Structure c. Organic matter content d. Color e. Depth f. Topography g. Drainage h. Origin. i. Native vegetation j. Natural productiveness III. The size of plots will depend upon the number of | desired and the area of land available for school pur - poses. IV. The wagon roads or turn ways, as indicated in the dia - gram, should be one rod wide. These large spaces » between the plots are sometimes sown to blue grass, brome grass or other grass seed. They are sometimes kept free from growing vegetation. V The path ways should be two feet wide so as to enable the students to move about the plots without injury to growing vegetation. The positions of these are in - dicated in the diagram. These strips should be kept free from growing vegetation. VI. A convenient form of plots is one in which th« length is twice that of the width. The plots in the diagram are four times as long as wide. VII. All plots should be uniform in size and form. VIII. The size of the plots should be a convenient fraction of an acre for easy computations. 1 X Keep systematic records of each plot for future reference. </seg>

Bradford, Principal of the School of Agriculture and Professor of Secondary Agricultural Education, who Inspected the Agricultural High Schools Agriculture was first taught in Nebraska high schools because it was required for a teacher's certificate. In most high schools it was a one semester subject attempting to cover the entire field of agriculture and taught with little reference to laboratory or field exercises. Usually the one chosen to give instruction in this subject was the science teacher because no one else came so near to having a knowledge of the soil and its products. ti response to a growing demand that agriculture should be with proper equipment and by teachers who were qualified, gislature of 1913 passed what is known as the Shumway Act g state aid to Nebraska high schools which could qualify to agriculture, manual training and domestic science according es and regulations laid down by the state superintendent of </seg>
            <seg id="p355">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT public instruction. The law provided that the state superintendent should recognize certain high schools which should receive state aid not to exceed $1,250, for each year. The number of schools to be recognized was left to the state superintendent with certain restric - tions as to location. For the first biennium the sum of $15,000, was appropriated to be distributed as state aid for the teaching of agriculture. Al - though it was well known that the sum of money from the state would be small many high schools applied for recognition and the following schools were recognized: Alliance, Alma, Aurora, Beatrice, Blair, Crete, Fairfield, Gothenburg, Hastings, Holdrege, Kimball County High School, O'Neill, Pawnee City, Red Cloud, St. Paul, South Omaha, Stromsburg, Tecumseh, Wahoo, and York. Each school was required to have at least a five acre tract of land to be used as a demonstration farm. Competent instructors in agriculture were to be employed and laboratories and libraries were to be equipped according to standards set forth by the state superintendent's office. No instructor in agriculture could be em - ployed without the approval of the Dean of the Nebraska College of Agriculture. For the first year eleven of the agricultural high schools secured instructors in agriculture who were graduates of four year courses in agricultural colleges. The remaining nine schools employed teachers of agriculture with fr3m one to three years of training. It was decided then that for the school year 1914-1915 teachers of agriculture should be required to have had at least twenty-four hours of training in some recognized agricultural college and for the year 1915-1916 the standard of preparation should be raised to forty The course of study in agriculture, manual training, and domestic science was prepared by a committee of public school superintendents and recommended for general use. This course of study is included in this report.

            <seg id="p357">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT Grade XII Subject to change to suit local conditions Most of the designated agricultural high schools at once organized classes in manual training and not more than two agricultural sub - jects. In domestic science both cooking and sewing classes were begun the first year. With this plan, from three to four years would be required before the entire four years course in agriculture could be put into operation. A few schools, which had been pioneers in the work before the arrival of state aid, were able to begin with students in every class in the course. In nearly all schools the chemistry and physics laboratories were made to accommodate the agricultural students while the domestic science laboratories were furnished with tables, stoves, kitchen cabinets, and other equipment necessary for the teaching of cooking and sewing. The larger high schools had cooking labora - tories furnished with gas, while schools in the smaller towns used for the most part kerosine stoves. A few had electric hot plates. Ewo visits were made by the inspector, one in the fall of 1913 second in the spring of 1914. One day was spent in each on each of the inspection trips. Interest Shown by Patrons In a large majority of the towns the patrons and school board were greatly interested in the new subject which was being taught in their high school. Their opinion was that agriculture, taught by a teacher who knew his subject, would tend to bring the high school into closer touch with the people. One school board member said, during the last visit of the inspector, that agriculture had brought their high school into greater favor with the farmers, had taught the country boys to be proud of the farm and had given the town boys a greater respect for the farmer and his business. K\s might be expected, in a few towns the people were indifferent even small numbers were antagonistic on account of the extra lse incurred in the introduction of the industrial subjects. Interest Shown by Pupils I Where only two classes in agriculture were organized in the of 1913, those classes were usually crowded. In many cases were found choosing the agriculture in place of foreign language, second semester found interest on the increase wherever the ler was able to present the subject matter as a study of nature K Semester P mistry or Elective . . nan or Elective tive •erio&lt; ids .5 5 5 5 Second Semester P&lt; Chemistry or Elective ....

            <seg id="p358">■nan's efforts and not a mere text book description. In only a few schools had the class enrollment decreased at the close of ear. Out-door Work E "lasses in animal husbandry found opportunity for judging at y farms, in stables of horse owners and in town barns where cows were kept. The stock yards furnished hogs and cattle kinds for study. ! Implement dealers were glad to have classes visit their sheds an hour of study on the farm machines. Separators and Bab - k testers were loaned to the schools and in many towns cream tions and creameries afforded splendid opportunities for the in - ction of the commercial handling of cream and milk. In the fall, cornfields were visited and estimates of yields made, methods of planting and cultivating were discussed, stalks and of corn compared and judged and the percentage of a perfect figured for small areas. The Five Acre Demonstration Plot the five acre plots were in most cases used for the planting of s crops for demonstration and experimental purposes. The of winter wheat, shallow and deep plowing, fertilizing with nt fertilizers were some of the projects attempted by many of hools. A number of varieties of grain were grown as a crop m. The harvesting of these grains furnished seed and grain head for a study of crops the following year. Conclusion Taken as a whole the first year of teaching agriculture in schools organized under the Shumway Act has, been a decided success. With small means and in many cases at an expense too great for the individual district, the schools have taught agriculture, manual training and domestic science in a manner that has interested the students and convinced the people of the distrid. It will be neces - sary, however, for the next legislature to appropriate much more liberally if the work is to be kept up according to the standards set for it. REPORT OF RURAL SCHOOL INSPECTOR By Edith A. Lathrop Hon. James E. Delzell, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. My dear Superintendent: I have the honor of submitting to you the following report of inspection of rural schools associated with the Agricultural High Schools established under the Shumway Act. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">Alliance R[n company with County Superintendent Delia M. Reed a visit made to District 124, Box Butte county. This school is asso - d with the Alliance High School. Miss Merle Welliver was the teacher. She held a second grade with honor certificate, had finished the eighth grade and in addition had attended three terms of the junior normal at Alliance. She had an enrollment of seven pupils, and six grades were represented. Nearly $30.00 had been invested in a bench and some tools. It was her habit to advise regularly with Mr. Clemmons, the manual training teacher at Alli - ance, relative to her work in this line. She was following the state course of study in agriculture. I found a good collection of seeds, soils, etc. Since there were no girls in the school, she did not attempt anything with domestic science. Her collection of manual training exhibits showed stools, necktie racks, scissor hangers, wedges and patterns of animals. Miss Welliver was enthusiastic about her work and was getting good results. The other school associated with the Alliance High School was visited in company with County Superintendent Delia M. Reed and Superintendent W. R. Pate. This district is No. 45, Box Butte county. The teacher, Miss Jessie Taylor, had finished the twelfth grade at Alliance, and in addition had had two summers of junior normal work. This district has no railroad property, hence found it difficult to raise funds on property situated in the sand hills. About $20.00 had been invested in a bench and manual training apparatus. Miss Taylor also advised with Mr. Clemmons relative to her work in manual training. The children furnished their own lumber. Nothing had been done in agriculture. Miss Taylor showed us quite a large exhibit of sewing. This work was a regular Friday afternoon exercise ?s well as the work in manual training. Alma No rural schools have yet been appointed as associated with the Alma High School. In company with County Superintendent Mattiene Bragg I visited the two schools that will probably be appointed for next year. One of these is a two room rural school which is carrying eight grades of work and is contemplating adding the ninth grade next year. There seemed to be a good field in this school for industrial work. Aurora E bounty Superintendent E. W. Jackson, Mr. R. W. Eaton of the rsity Farm and myself started out in a blizzard to visit the schools associated with Aurora. These schools are fortunate ving teachers who have been especially trained for their work b School of Agriculture at Lincoln. Because of the storm we not able to get farther than the boarding place of Miss Malloy. f the teachers referred to above. We enjoyed a good country </seg>
            <seg id="p360">AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOLS Eand talked with Miss Malloy relative to her equipment and It would seem from all reports that the work of these two has been very satisfactory. Crete Only one school has been associated with the Crete High School this past year. This is District 87, Saline county. County Superin - tendent L. J. Bouchal accompanied me on a visit to this school. Miss Bessie Herget, a graduate of the Crete High School, had charge of the work. I found a bench with tools, an oil stove and some dishes. The exhibit of manual training work showed tabourets, and flower stands. Miss Herget had served warm lunches regularly all winter at the noon hour, soup being one of the favorite dishes. In agriculture she had been guided by suggestions in the state course of study. Miss Herget's school was well organized and the room was very orderly. She had no extra room for cooking, so her cup - board, stove and manual training bench were all in the general assembly room. Fairfield At the time of my visit to Clay county, only one school had bet-n selected as associated with the Agricultural School at Fairtield. This county reported later that a second school had been affiliated. County Superintendent Mabel Kirk, Mr. John Boehr, the agricultural teacher at Fairfield, and Miss Mattie Hall, the domestic science teacher, inspected District No. 36 with me. A very fine equipment had been placed in this school, somewhere about $75.00 had been expended in a bench and tools. In addition there was a fine kitchen - cabinet and an oil stove. Mrs. Emma R. Wilkins the teacher had been giving attention to this industrial work Friday afternoons. Gothenburg I a the time of my visit no associated rural schools had befn nted in Dawson county. However, County Superintendent ?r met me at Gothenburg and arranged for conferences with 1 officers in perspective districts. City Superintendent P. M. ;head accompanied us on this trip. The conferences with the I officers seemed favorable and it is probable that Gothenburg lave associated rural schools next year. Hasting* K stings has one associated rural school. This is Distric ams C3unty. The teacher, Miss Grace Weiler, is a normal graduate from Hastings. She has had in addition one term summer school. Mr. Joseph Rees, the teacher of agriculture Hastings High School, and County Superintendent L. R. inspected the school with me. We found a kitchen cabinet oil stove. There was also a good equipment of dishes. Warm had been served twice a week all through the year. We </seg>
            <seg id="p361">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT inspected the school on Friday afternoon and saw the girls at work with their sewing. The beginning of the work along the industrial line in Adams county is the outgrowth of an industrial teachers' institute held during thi- summer of 1912. Nothing was offered in that institute but agriculture, manual training and domestic science. On the closing day of the institute a spelling contest was held. The prizes in that contest w.Te a work bench and complete set of tools and a kitchen cabinet. The kitchen cabinet was won by the teacher in District No. 40. Holdrege Holdrege was the first school visited and this was in February and at that date the associated rural schools had not been decided upon. However, County Superintendent Aletta Neff had planned a systematic tour of the schools in her county and we inspected the two schools that she had decided upon as being desirable to affiliate with Holdrege. At the close of our day's visit we drove into Hol - drege and held a conference with Superintendent C. W. Mi-Michael and his agriculture teacher Mr. J. G. McMillan. Mr. McMillan later prepared some excellent outlines along his line of work for the teachers in the associated schools, and all reports indicated that the work was being most effectively done in these schools. Kimball County High School County Superintendent Claude Alden and myself were about three hours following a muddy trail to the one rural school asso - ciated with the Kimball County High School. Miss Winifred Chid - ester, the teacher, is a graduate of the Kearney High School and has had four years of experience. Six grades were represented in her school with an enrollment of sixteen. Mann's Agriculture was the text used for the eighth grade. The boys in this class alternated agricul - ture with geography. About the only thing done in the way of warm lunches was the roasting of potatoes. A very fine exhibit of sewing showed samples of the various stitches, hemming, patching, etc. The children had hemmed the safh curtains for their room. A crude bench was fitted up for manual training. Tools were borrowed from the neighborhood and old dry goods boxes furnished the only avail - able lumber. One of the ranchers' wives, with whom Miss Chidester boarded, had been assisting with the sewing. Considering the meager equipment, this school was doing some very satisfactory work along industrial lines. Pawnee City In a tour with County Superintendent Lulu Wolford over Paw - nee county, the associated schools of Pawnee City were inspected. Mr. R. C. Grubb, in District No. 14, had thirty pupils and all eight grades were represented. He had two benches and two complete sets of tools aside from his own set. Over $60.00 had been spent in equipment. The lumber in discarded desks was being made use of </seg>
            <seg id="p362">AGRICULTURAL HIGH BCHOOLS in manual training. His exhibit showed more than fifty art which included plate racks, tabourets, flower stands, picture frames, foot stools, book racks, waste paper baskets, pencil trays, towel rollers, magazine racks and a piano bench. Considerable work had been done in sewing. Recipes were given the girls at school and the cooking was carried on at home. We saw these pupils at work with their tools and some good pictures were secured. The other associated rural school was in the hands of Miss Sarah B. Miller, one of the most experienced and one of the best teachers of the county. Her building was poor and her equipment crude. Only about $5.00 had been spent for tools. The bench was home made. Superintendent Wolford has made a special effort along indi. lines in her county and the results of this were plainly shown in all her schools. Superintendent I. N. Clark of Pawnee City accompanied us in the visit to the associated schools. Red Cloud A day was spent in the schools of Webster County in company with Superintendent Gertrude Coon. Miss Coon and Superintendent Moritz have no associated schools this year. We visited the two schools which will probably be associated with Red Cloud next year. Miss Coon felt that these districts were not ready to take up this work, and rather than make a failure of it she decided to wait until the proper teachers and proper line of equipment could be secured. South Omaha When I landed in the station in Omaha I found Superintend- Yoder ready with his fine touring car for a tour of inspection of the rural schools of Douglas county. He had with him the manual training teacher, Mr. R. O. Bagby, and the domestic science teacher, Miss Mary Bookmeyer. Our first visit was to District No. 6, one of the associated schools with South Omaha. This is a two room school where eight grades of work are attempted. Miss Laura Craig, the principal, teaches four grades. About $50.00 had been spent in equipment along industrial lines. One of the small cloak rooms had been fitted up for a kitchenette. During our visit to this school Superintendent Yoder arranged for a conference for the teacher and pupils with both Mr. Bagby and Miss Bookmeyer. Mr. Bagby gave the boys some very helpful suggestions for the industrial work, and Miss Bookmeyer got the girls aroused over domestic science. The other school in Douglas county, associated with South Omaha, is in the hands of Miss Mamie Malloy. Miss Malloy is a graduate of the School of Agriculture at Lincoln. She had a little hall re - painted and we found a very dainty and attractive kitchenette. Her bench and tools were in the back of the main room. Warm lunches had been served all winter. On Friday afternoon when she has charge of the industrial work, she calls in an assistant to help </seg>

The assistant is a young girl in the neighborhood. This school had done remarkable work along all industrial lines. Superintendent H. A. Collins of Sarpy county was so anxious to have one of his schools associated with South Omaha that he urged one of the districts to do such work as would entitle them to state aid under the Shumway Act. He selected District No. 18, in charge of Miss Besack. In a visit to that school I found a very well equipped and roomy school building. A hall contained a cup - board and oil stove for cooking conveniences, and the manual train - ing bench was in the rear of the main room. Some work in cooking had been attempted. The teacher had used the State Farm bulletins and her manual training patterns were pencil drawings furnished by Superintendent Collins. 1 found the school gardens quite general in both Douglas and counties. In fact Superintendent Yoder had furnished seeds pupils of his county together with a little manual on school St. Paul IIo rural schools were appointed this year as associated with aul. I spent a portion of the day with Superintendent E. L. of Howard county. We visited one cf the schools which Mr. considered as a desirable one to affiliate with the St. Paul School. Stromsburg B bounty Superintendent Amelia Rasmussen, Mr. I. R. Palmer, er of agriculture in Stromsburg, and myself started out in an nobile to visit the rural schools associated with the Stromsburg School. We got stuck in the mud, walked two miles to the school and had a carriage meet us. Miss Eulalie Lindberg, a graduate of the Stromsburg Normal Training class, is the teacher I charge. Mr. Palmer spends considerable time in inspecting both these associated schools. He prepares outlines in agriculture from nth to month for the teachers. The other associated rural school n charge of Miss Fay Marquis. Miss Marquis is a graduate of Normal Training class of the Osceola High School. The work te here is a duplicate of that done in the former school. Tecumseh Both the rural schools associated with the Tecumseh High School were found to be in excellent shape. In the forenoon I went with Superintendent V. L. Strickland to visit Miss Rosa Dennis in District No. 18. Miss Dennis has finished her junior year at Peru, has had six years of experience and has some special training herself along industrial lines. I found a bench and full set of tools for </seg>
            <seg id="p364">AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCH(" manual training. Her exhibit showed that some effective work had been done. Warm lunches had been served all through the year and a systematic course in sewing had been given. We visited this school on a stormy forenoon. Miss Dennis had no halls and hence, everything had to be housed in one room. She was deserving of great commendation for the system and order which was seen both in her room and in her program. In the afternoon Superintendent L. C. Kuster accompanied me on a visit to Miss Ora Bush, teacher in District No. 73, who has charge of the other associated rural school. Miss Bush has the same equipment as was found in N She has a better building and hence is able to have her domestic science work housed in a different room. She has been serving hot lunches during the winter. Macaroni and cheese, soups, baked I hot chocolate and muffins were among the things that had been There is no question but that the introduction of industrial subjects into the one teacher school adds an additional burden to the already over crowded program. It is an attempt to give rural children all the advantages found in our present city building equip - ped with laboratories and special trained teachers. In short it is an attempt to put a twentieth century school course into an eighteenth century plant. I put this question to the teachers: "Does this additional work crowd the program?" In nearly every case the answer was that it did. One teacher solved the problem by calling in a young woman of the neighborhood who acted as an assistant on Friday afternoons when special lessons were given in domestic science and manual training. One teacher admitted that it was difficult to concentrate one's thoughts on arithmetic when the room was filled with the fumes of a chicken dinner. In every case it was found that the teacher with special training along industrial lines was succeed - ing better in her work. The best teachers had been trained in the school of agriculture connected with Nebraska's agricultural college. Fletcher B. Dressier, who is a national authority on school sanitation and architecture says that we should no longer speak of the one-room-school, but rather the one- teacher-school. The modern school, he says, cannot be carried on in a single room. The one teacher rural school with its broad course, offering instruction in experimental agriculture, manual training and domestic science along with the so-called cultural studies, can never compete with a similar course offered in the well equipped city school. Knowledge of all these subjects rightfully belongs to the country child and the country boy and girl is entitled to every advantage offered the city boy and </seg>
            <seg id="p365">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT The Shumway act has demonstrated that from a physical point of view, hot lunches are a good thing for a rural school; that the study of agriculture and manual training is giving to boys, practice in the things that they will do as men; and that instruction in the domestic arts is giving the girls training that will help them become practical home keepers, and women of refinement. And it has further demonstrated that one teacher and one room cannot handle all this in a satisfactory manner, and that the country boy will never come into his rightful heritage until we have the consolidated school. And herein is the great mission of the Shumway rural school in Nebraska. </seg>

The egislature was so overwhelmed with a flood of school law bills they requested the governor to appoint a commission to make rough investigation and present to the next legislature such a Dn of the school laws as will best meet present day demand?. We, the undersigned members of the commission, respectfully ask you as leaders in education to give us any suggestions you may have for the betterment of the public schools, together with your reasons therefor. We would further ask you to name some citizen in your community especially interested in education whose co - operation would be valuable in preparing this needed change in the present school laws. E lease address all communications to Miss Edith A. Lathrop, ary of the School Law Revision Commission, Lincoln. i. Yours very respectfully, James E. Delzell, Chairman Edith A. Lathrop, Secretary N.

Sheldon of the Legislative Reference Bureau was an honorary member by mutual consent of its members. His ce, advice and investigations have been of untold value to the ssion in determining its recommendations. He prepared for e of the commission a comparative table of every state in the covering the following points: 1. Units of administration. 2. Course of study in country schools. 3. Basis of apportionment of state school funds. 4. Consolidation of schools. 5. Certification of teachers. 6. Compulsory school attendance. 7. Minimum length of school year 8.

            <seg id="p371">His important mission was the explanation of the county unit organi - zation for the administration of school affairs and for other phases of school administration work. Mr. Monahan is a student and an authority on the various units of school administration existing throughout the various states of the United States. He is the author of a number of Bureau of Education publications, one of which, The Status of Rural Education in the United States, gives a report of the important features of the county unit, the township unit, and the district unit. He is the author also of the bulletin entitled The County Unit of Administration of Rural Schools, which gives in more or less detail the features of this system. He said that ten states bordering close to Nebraska will present county unit measures to their various legislatures this winter and that Nebraska may be a leader in this as she has been in other educational measures, or she may follow in the rear, for county unit unit is going to come sooner or later. In Conclusion This commission was appointed on September 17, 1913, and at a meeting held November 28, 1913, met with your Excellency for a short session. You explained to the commission that you regarded this as one of the most important commissions that you had ap - pointed and urged us to be especially thorough in our investigations. We called your attention to the fact that this would be impos - sible if the commission made its report by the time specified in the resolution. You made it clear that thorough work was more de - sirable than any time limit. The commission has followed this sug - gestion and has made as thorough an investigation as lay within its power It has been greatly handicapped because of lack of funds. Through the medium of the State Teachers' Association $150.00 was secured which has enabled the commission to print and distribute the report. As this appropriation was not made until November 6, 1914, it was not possible to distribute the report at an earlier date. The commission has been careful to give the newspapers, after every meeting, a complete report of all its proceedings. Its meetings have been advertised in advance through the medium of the public press and have at all times been open to the public. It has been the effort of the commission in its work to suggest such changes as will affect an equal distribution of the best educational advantages to all the boys and girls in every school district of the state, and we ask the citizens and the legislature to review the work of the commission with the realization that this has been our motive, and if any of you have suggestions to offer which you think will better our report, we ask you to give them, bearing in mind at all times the welfare of the children of this great state. </seg>

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION State Superintendent The elimination of the office of state superintendent and the creation of a State Board of Education, with authority to appoint a Commissioner of Education as its executive officer and to perform such other duties as may be provided by the statutes. Reason: This places the office on an educational in - stead of a political basis and places a premium on ac - complishment and service rather than trying to get on the good side of the electorate. School Lands Khe commission recommends an amendment preventing the r sale of school lands. Reason: The schools of the state are entitled to the increase in value of the land. </seg>
            <seg id="p373">REVISION OF THE SCHOOL LAWS CHANGES IN THE PRESENT LAW CHAPTER 71 SCHOOLS Revised Statutes of Nebraska 1913 ARTICLE I SCHOOL DISTRICT fc. 4. First — Amend second paragraph to read as follows: the county superintendent shall have discretionary power to a new district from other organized districts upon a petition by one-half of the legal voters in each district affected." t Reason: The present law requires the signature of ne-third of the legal voters. The purpose in raising the per - entage is a check upon the tendency to multiply small istricts. !SEC. 4. Fourth — Strike out the second sentence of the paragraph •h reads as follows: "One district may be discontinued and its tory attached to other adjoining districts upon petition signed by half of the legal voters in each district affected," and substitute following: "Districts located contiguous to each other may unite form one consolidated district in the manner following: "Fourth (a i -The boards of directors in the districts affected shall require their secretaries to give at least ten days notice of the time and place for a meeting of the electors residing in each of said districts whenever each of said district boards shall agree to order such an election, or whenever a written request of ten legal voters, or if there be not ten then a majority of such voters in each of said districts, is presented to their respective boards in favor of uniting.

It involves so much red tape in the circulation of petitions that the in terest is often lost before the preliminary steps effecting con solidation are completed. Again, the fact that there is no definite requirement for transportation has worked hardships One district said, "They got us in and then cut out the transportation."

            <seg id="p375">REVISION OF THE SCHOOL LAWS enting this combined consolidation and vocational mt or rural schools we have followed largely the plan in force in owa. A letter from the Iowa State Department of Eduea - ion dated in November, 1914. »myi that within the year sixty schools have consolidated in that state replacing hree hundred and fifty one-room rural schools; that the buildings erected have cost from $10,000 to $50,000; and the writer concludes the letter with the statement that Iowa will within a brief period of time be one of the leading state&gt; n the Union in the matter of consolidation. In offering state aid for vocational training we are offering an inducement to he country to provide for its youth instruction in those sub - ects which touch in a vital way the community life. 4. Sixth Add the following sentence: "This apply to change of boundaries nor to consolidation of districts Reason: A ruling to the effect that the restriction against the formation of new districts between May and October shall not apply to change of boundaries nor to con - solidation has been followed. This is simply embodying the ruling into the law. ARTICLE li DISTRICT MEETINGS BBC. SI. Change the date of the annual meeting from last ay in June to third Monday in June. Reason: This will escape the season of wheat harvest. An earlier date would make it difficult for school officers to settle up the business of the year; and a later date would hurry county superintendents and the state department in making their reports. Skc. 38. Amend the tirst sentence so that it will read as fol - "The qualified voters in any new school district, when law - fully assembled tor the first time, shall have power to adjourn for not longer than a period of six weeks to designate a site for a school house, by vote of two-thirds of those present, and the qualified voters of any established district may change the same by similar vote at any annual meeting." Follow this sentence with the follow - ing ruling: "Neither is there any authority for adjourning the annual meeting for the purpose of changing the site when once established." Reason: The present law permits the voters in a new district to adjourn indefinitely until a site is established. It seems best to limit the time for the selection of a site. Wrangling in the district may so prolong the designation ol a site that school will be interfered with. The lust sentence embodies into the law a ruling which is now followed. </seg>
            <seg id="p376">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT 42. Insert "latest" before "assessed valuation" in the fourth line. Reason: Sometimes county clerks omit sending the —nod valuation to joint districts because it is not possible o get the valuation for the present year on or before the '15th day of June" as the law requires. They must wait until the board of equalization sits and this is usually late n July. The insertion of the word "latest" will permit the county clerk to send the valuation of the previous year. EEC. 46. In the first paragraph provide for seven months school minimum for any district. Also add this new provision at the of the section: "Provided, the county superintendent be given to carry into effect the provisions of the section." Reason: State aid districts levying the maximum o hirty-five mills are required to hold seven months schoo nd districts able to support themselves should do as well Vhere districts fail to meet the provisions of the law relative o length of term, it seems best that the county superin - endent be given authority to carry these provisions into effect in the same manner in which that officer is given au - hority to carry into effect the provisions for the levy of the ree high school tax. Sec. 50. Add the following provision at the close of this set "Provided further, that county superintendents are hereby authorized to include in their estimates to the state superintendent, of the amount necessary for state aid in their respective counties, a sum necessary for free high school tuition for all pupils entitled to such tuition under the provisions of the free high school act, and residing in school districts exempt from such tuition as set forth in the provisions of the law on free high school education. It shall also be the duty of said county supe intendents to pay public school districts earning such tuition from the funds allowed and appor - tioned to their counties by the state superintendent. '' Reason: Under the present system children finishing the eighth grade in weak districts are denied the advantage of free high school tuition. This is not a square deal to the children in the sparsely settled portions of the state. IIec. 52. Amend the second sentence to r?ad as follows: "The ated income for the current year shall be the sum of all moneys ging to the district on hand in the district and county treasuries all unbended indebtedness has been paid in full, ex - ve of all sinking funds held fcr building purposes or for payment of outstanding bonds, [ lus the maximum amount </seg>
            <seg id="p377">REVISION OF THE SCHOOL LAWS that can be raised by taxation of state school funds." plus the estimated apportionment Reason: The present law does not contemplate the de - duction of indebtedness from money on hand. The change is suggested because a literal interpretation of the law of 1913 was not equitable, in that it counted as available for current expenses moneys on hand that had been collected from past levies and should be applied on the debts incurred in the preceding years. To illustrate: A district might have in the hands of the county and district treasurers $100.00 collected from the levy made for the past year. There might be an indebtedness of $100.00 or more incurred during the past year. Obviously the $100.00 on hand should be ap - plied on the past incurred indebtedness. But under a literal interpretation of the law as it stands the $100.00 on hand would be counted as available for current expenses. ARTICLE IV POWERS AND DUTIES OF DISTRICT OFFICERS tSEC. 74. Insert after the words qualified teachers in lines :J and the following: "Provided said teachers are recommended by the unty superintendent for that particular school." Reason: Under the present law the recommendation of the county superintendent is not required. It seems wi3e that the recommendation of the county superintendent be an essential factor in the selection of a teacher since that officer is in a better position to know the real value of a teacher than any other one person in the county. Very often a teachar will make a success in one district but fail in another. The recommendation of the county superin - tendent would very often prevent these misfits. ARTICLE V DISTRICT BOARDS -POWERS AND DUTIES Sec. 84. Amend this section to read as follows: "The district school boards shall have the general care of the schools and shall have the power to cause pupils to be taught in such branches and classified in such grades or departments as may seem best adapted to a prescribed state course of study, and the school board of each district shall cause a record of the advancement in each branch of study of all pupils to be kept in a book provided for this purpose; and it is hereby made the duty of each district board, or one of their number empowered by the board, to attend all meetings' called by the county superintendent for the purpose of making such rules and regulations and of devising such means as they may think neces - sary for the government and health of the pupils and of devising such means as may seem best to secure regular attendance and pro - gress of children at school. Provided, that it shall be the duty of the district to pay the actual expenses for attendance of at least one a </seg>
            <seg id="p378">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT meeting during the year of said member empowered by the board to attend such school officers' meeting." Reason: The present law leaves the establishing of a course of study with the county school officer. In actua practice this is not done, it being the custom to follow the tate course of study. The state course of study is preparec &gt;y teachers who have given their life work to school prob - ems and school officers generally feel that the teachers know more about the preparation of a course of study than the&gt; themselves. The present law makes no provision for the pay ment of expenses for school officers while in attendance a' county meetings. Sometimes the attendance at schoo officers meetings is a burden upon the officer. Again, the at tendance at school board meetings would be very much in creased if the expenses were assured. IsEC. 94. Add the following to this section: "Any violation of section automatically removes him as a member of the board, the board shall proceed at once to fill the vacancy; and said r so removed shall be ineligible to vacancy for which he was Reason: This provides a penalty for school officers interested in contracts for building or furnishing supplies in their official capacity as members of the board. "Sec. 96. School District Library — The treasurer of every county in this state shall withhold annually from the general school funds of each school district in his county the sum of ten cents per pupil as shown by the total number of pupils within each school district in that county at the last annual census. Said amount so set aside shall be known as the school district library fund, and shall be annually invested in books other than the regular text books. It shall be the duty of the county superintendent to report on or before the fifteenth day of October of each year to the county clerk and county treasurer of his county a statement of the number of persons of school age in each school district of the county. "Sec. 96 (a). Superintendents to select books between April 1 and Sept. 1 — Between the first days of April and September of each year the county superintendent for schools organized under article three, and the city superintendents or principals for schools organized under article 6 and 22 shall provide for the expenditure of all moneys withheld by the county treasurer for the purchase of library books, for their respective schools, said books to be selected from a list prepared and furnished by the Nebraska Public Library Commission, and to be distributed among the dis - tricts of the county in proportion to the amount of money withheld from each.

The county superintendent shall also certify to the county clerk the names and numbers of the books selected for each district, the price fixed in the list issued by the Nebraska Public Library Commission to be attached in each case and the total cost of such books to be cor - rectly summarized and indicated. "Sec. 96 tei. City superintendents in districts organized under articles six and twenty-two shall in like manner certify to the county clerk the cost of the books selected for the schools under their jurisdiction. A duplicate copy shall be furnished to the com - panies or firms selected by the Nebraska Public Library Commis - sion to furnish the books, preiodicals, etc., for school libraries. The com - panies or firms shall, upon the receipt of the list from the county or city superintendent, fill the order for each district or city as directed, said order when so filled to be sent to the director of the district or the secretary of the Board of Education. The director or sec - retary shall immediately, upon the receipt of the books from the companies or firms, compare the order so filled with the list in his possession and shall immediately report to the county or city super - intendent. If such report is satisfactory and discloses no error or irregularity in the number, kind or condition of the books received, the county or city superintendent shall notify the county clerk to draw an order upon the county treasurer for the cost of the books so furnished to each district or city. If the report is unsatisfactory, the proper superintendent shall forthwith report the fact and the cause thereof to the companies or firms supplying the library books. Such companies or firms shall forthwith take steps to rectify any error or irregularity which may have been made in the filling of the order for the books in question. "Sec. 96 (f i.

The county treasurer shall thereupon immediately issue a warrant in favor of the companies or firms for the amount so certified. KSec. 96 (g). Payment of Transportation Charges The ex - charges and postage on books purchased under the provisions s act shall be paid by the district or city receiving them. E"Sec. 97. Rules — Care — The school boards or school trustees provide for the care of such library at the schoolhouse, and the • superintendent, together with the secretary of the Nebraska Public ary Commission, shall furnish rules and regulations under which library shall be used by the district." Reason: The present law makes the selection of library &gt;ooks optional with the local boards, does not insure &gt;roper selection of books, and does not provide for a uniform and systematic care of the same. The amendment insures a growing library for every school district in the state. B &gt;lacing the compilation of the list for selection with th State Library Commission we are utilizing the services c pecially trained librarians with a wide knowledge of chile en's books and securing a close co-operation of the librar and school interests of the state. A well chosen list wit lirections for the systematic care of the books will result i iniformly good school libraries impossible under the presen laphazard system. In making these changes in the schoo ibrary law we are simply following the lead of all the states which have developed strong school library systems. A &gt;resent Nebraska is one of the very few states not insurin &gt;y law the proper selection and care of books in its school 1 &gt;rary. ARTICLE VIII FREE HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION KEC. 115. Amend to raise the tuition from seventy-five for each week's attendance to one dollar for each week's lance. Reason: This raises the year's tuition from $27 to $36 per year. It is costing the high schools on an average $50.00 per year to educate non-resident pupils. In a recent letter from a member of the Fairbury school board to the state department of education reasons are made plain why rural districts in Jefferson county are able to pay $50.00 per year tuition. What is said of Jefferson county applies equally well to all counties in the more thickly settled portions of the state. The following is a quotation from the letter of the Fairbury school officer: "In Jefferson county this year the rural districts have an average levy of ll| mills including the bond levies and money paid out for tuition. The accredited high schools of the county have an average levy of 35 2-5 mills not including tuition and license money also expended. The chief high school that takes about 90', of the non-resident pupils, has a levy of 46 mills and also expends tuition and license money equiva - lent to 65 mills more. This school has an average of about </seg>
            <seg id="p381">REVISION OF THE SCHOOL LAWS one pupil from each rural district of the county, represent - ing a loss of more than $2,000. "If the rural districts paid $50.00 tuition, the average increase of taxes necessary one mill, making their total about 12; mills, as against high school district whose ploy." would be $23.00 or less than burden of school taxes average four times that much for the services the rural districts em- EC. 116. Add the following provision at the close of the : "Provided, that should the parent or guardian remove to • district before the expiration of the time for which free :hool attendance was applied for, the district in which such s levied will still be holden for tuition." Reason: Under the present reading of the law the parent removing from the district forfeits the right of tuition for his child for the remainder of the school year. This loss of tuition in nearly all cases falls upon the tenant who is least able to pay it. His personal property has in E early all cases been assessed in the district from which he amoves and since the school district is enjoying the benefit f his taxes it is only just that said district provide his hild with high school tuition for the remainder of the school ear. Kc. 118. Amend so as to conclude the section as follows: ded, the county superintendent shall notify all parties in - 1 upon the approval of n in-accredited schools." Reason: The present law makes no provision for the notification of persons interested relative to approved schools. A pupil may bring credentials for the completion of a certain grade of work in an approved school to the city superin - tendent of an accredited school and yet the city superin - tendent is at a loss to know whether such pupil can legally be holden for tuition. ARTICLE X -NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS Sec. 142. Amend to read as follows: "The appropriation pro - vided by this article for instruction in high schools of students in the science and practice of common school teaching shall be deemed to include and shall include due inspection and supervision of such instruction under the direction cf the state superintendent of public instruction, and the expenses of such inspection and super - vision shall be paid out of the appropriation on vouchers certified by the state superintendent." Reason: The present law omits giving the state super - intendent power to appoint an Inspector. It was not the intent of the maker of the bill nor the law makers that the state superintendent should himself do this inspecting; but rather an inspector appointed by him. </seg>
            <seg id="p382">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT ARTICLE XIII— TEACHERS' CERTIFICATES Sec. 156. Strike oat the entire third provision thus elimi - nating the issuance of third grade certificates. Reason: The crying need of the rural schools is better trained teachers. These third grade teachers are usually little more than eighth grade graduates with no professional training. Sec. 160. Amend the portion of the first sentence as far as "Provided" in the seventh line to read as follows: "The second grade county certificate may be granted to any person of approved learning and character, who shall pass a satisfactory examination in orthography, reading, penmanship, geography, arithmetic, physiology and hygiene, English composition, English grammar, United States history, civil government, bookkeeping, blackboard drawing, theory and art of teaching, and the elements of agriculture, including a fair knowledge of the structure and habits of the common plants, insects, birds and quadrupeds: Provided, that the fees received by the state superintendent as herein provided shall be deposited with the state treasurer at the close of each month, and drawn out on vouchers certified by the state superintendent." Reason: The present law states that the applicant sha pass "in addition to the branches specified for the thin trade county certificate," a satisfactory examination in civi fovernment, bookkeeping, etc. Since the third grade certifi cate is recommended to be eliminated, it is necessary to name the branches for a second grade county certificat n this section. This plan of depositing examination fee with the state treasurer and drawing the same out only jpon vouchers, while not required by law, has been followec jy the state superintendent since 1911. Sec. 161. Strike out the entire section. Reason: This section names the branches required for a third grade certificate, and is combined with Sec. 160 above. ARTICLE XIV — TEACHERS AND TEACHERS* INSTITUTES Sec. 178. In the second requirement for incorporated educa tional institutions raise the investment from $50,000 to $100,009. Reason: $50,000 is not a sufficient investment to establish a school plant Capable of giving the best service. Many of the high schools in the state have an investment, including school plant, equipment and teaching force, far in AWfMMM t\t *£ft f\fi(\ 111 tfACWB Ul </seg>
            <seg id="p383">REVISION OF THE SCHOOL LAWS 180. Amend so as to conclude with this provision: "Pro - vided, that in all vocational schools in which agriculture, domestic science, manual training, or any other industrial subject is taught no teacher shall be employed to teach these subjects after Sep - tember, 1916, who has not qualified to give such instruction by pats - ing an examination under the rules and regulations prescribed by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, or by holding a diploma or certificate from industrial courses of study pursued in a State University, State Normal School, Standard College, or private Normal School recognized or accredited by the State Super - intendent of Public Instruction." Reason: This guarantees that competent instruction will be given in industrial subjects. Sec. 181. Change the months for holding teachers' institutes from June, July and August to September, October and November. Reason: Teachers should not be asked to use the vaca - tion period to attend institutes unless they are paid for their time in attendance. If the institute is held after school has begun the teacher will be in a better position to receive suggestions of real value from the institute session. Sec. 182. Amend the paragraph to read as follows after "joint institutes" in the third line: "during the time that such insti - tute is held for the purpose of comparing notes, planning and out - lining the work of the current school year and to study methods of school work and the science and art of teaching." Reason: The present law requires attendance of one week. There is a tendency to shorten this time to two o three days as is the case with city institutes. This woult be very desirable where institutes were held in the autumn when schools were in session. The phrase "or coming school year" appearing after "current" would be unneces sary provided institutes were held after schools had begun. CSec. 184. Raise the minimum amount to be given by county ds from $25 to $50. Reason: A minimum of $50 now means about the same as a minimum of $25 at the time the statute was written when consideration is given to the increase in the cost of conducting institutes. Sec. 187. Add at the close of the section the following pro - visions: "Provided, that teacher's attendance at the institute shall be counted the same as her services in the school room under her contract: Provided, further, that teachers holding positions in </seg>
            <seg id="p384">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT schools organized under Article 22 are required to attend the city or county institute unless excused by the city superintendent." Reason: Under the present statute the teacher draws no salary while in attendance at institute. Assuring the continuance of the teacher's salary while in attendance at nstitutes is just, for the teacher gives back to the district through the agency of the school the improved methods and inspiration gained while in attendance at the professional meeting. Again, it often costs the teacher several times the salary earned in the few days that she spends at the in - stitute. The last provision is already a ruling. City teachers need to attend institutes as well as do country teachers. Too often these teachers seem to think that the holding of the better positions means professional stagnation. ARTICLE XV— COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT R.EC. 188. Amend the second sentence to read as follows: person shall be eligible to the office of county superintendent does not hold at least a professional state certificate valid ebraska and has not had three years of successful experi - as a teacher." Reason: The present law requires the county superin - tendent to hold a county first grade certificate and makes no requirement as to experience. In many counties a fair percent of the rural teachers hold county first grade certifi - cates. It seems only reasonable that the leader of the schools of a county should be better equipped educationally than the teachers to be supervised. The requirement of actual experience prevents the election of county superin - tendents unfamiliar with school work. Sec. 32. (Chapter 21, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1913 Amend the third sentence as far as the colon to read as follows: "The county board shall allow the county superintendent such clerk hire and traveling expenses as they deem necessary and for said traveling expenses the county superintendent shall present such sworn statements and receipts as the county board may require:" Reason: The present law reads that county boards nay at their option allow the county superintendent clerical lelp and traveling expenses. It is poor economy to pay a county superintendent a salary of from $1,200 to $1,800 a rear for the purpose of supervising the schools and promot - ng the educational interests of the county and then tie that officer down to routine office work such as can be performed &gt;y a fifty dollar clerk. The sheriff is paid mileage and a fee when he goes out on official duties and his trips are very ew when compared to those of the county superintendent The county superintendent is often punished to the extent of paying his own traveling expen.ies when out in the per formance of his official duties. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">REVISION OF THE SCHOOL LAWS Sbc. 189. Amend by placing after "same" in the fifth line "to recommend teachers." Reason: The argument for this is given under Article IV. Powers and Duties of District Officers, Sec. 74, in this pamphlet. ARTICLE XVI -STATE SUPERINTENDENT ■EC. 199. Amend by adding the following provision at the of the section: "Provided, that no person shall be elected superintendent who does not hold a life certificate and who &gt;t had five years successful experience as a teacher." Reason: The present statute fails to provide any educational qualifications for the state superintendent. It would be possible under existing laws for an illiterate to become a candidate for the highest educational office in the state. ARTICLE XVII SCHOOLHOUSE SITES Sec. 210. Add the following paragraph to this section BSec. 210 lai School buildings shall be located on as high d as possible at as great a distance as possible from low, y ground and from railroads, manufacturing plants and other ■s of noise, smoke, dust or danger." b Reason: Our present law makes no provision for the nitary location of school buildings. To compel children attend school and then make no definite requirements relative to a sanitary environment is criminal. Sec. 214. Add the following paragraphs: "Sec. 214 (a). No public moneys shall be expended for the purchase of a site or the erection or alteration of any school build - ing in the state until a proper contract has been made in writing and signed by the parties to the contract, or their agents thereto duly authorized. No contract for the purchase of or the erection or alteration of any school building shall be enforceable unless a certified copy of the plans of said building or alteration shall be attached to and made a part of said contract together with a sworn statement of the state superintendent of public instruction setting forth that the proposed plans for the building or the alteration comply, in every particular with the requirements of law. Any treasurer of any school district in this state who shall pay out public moneys in viola - tion of the provisions of this section shall be personally liable there - for and his bondsmen shall also be bound. "Sec. 214 ibi It shall be the duty of the state superintendent to prescribe rules and examine all plans and specifications for the erection, enlargement and change of school buildings, which plans and specifications shall first be submitted to him for approval before contract is let, and no new school building shall be erected or any </seg>
            <seg id="p386">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT Ing enlarged or changed until the plans and specifications have submitted to and have been approved by the state superin - nt of public instruction. He shall include in such rules those from time to time by the state board of health, relative to iry standards for toilets, water supply and disposal of sewage blic school buildings. In all other respects the authority to rules for public school buildings shall be vested in the state ntendent of public instruction." Reason: The average citizen does not attach sufficient importance to the proper lighting, heating, and ventilation &gt;f schoolhouses. This is the reason that the commission eels the act above suggested is necessary. We have the precedent of many states to guide us in making these regula - ions and, in addition, we have the precedent of our state which has passed certain regulations affecting the building of factories, tenements, hotels, etc. ARTICLE XIX — COMPULSORY EDUCATION Sec. 225. Amend the sixth line to read "or youth to attend the public day schools for a period of not less than twenty weeks." Amend the beginning to the sentence reading "In city and metro - politan districts" to read as follows: "In city, metropolitan city, town or village school districts every person residing within," etc. Amend the exemption as to distance, line thirty, so that it will read "two and one-half miles" instead of "two miles." Reason: The present law makes the minimum for school attendance twelve weeks. The commission has recom nended that the minimum length of school terra be raisec rom four months to seven months. Since the length of the erm has been increased it seems only reasonable that the ength of time requiring attendance at school be raised in similar proportion. The present law does not include corporate limits o towns and villages. In these small towns are to be fount oo many boys and girls loafing on the streets when they ought to be in school. There is no reason why children ir he small towns be required to attend school only two-thirds of the year while those in the cities be required to attend the entire time. b Where parents are really interested in the education of eir children they do not let the difference of a half-mile terfere. Sec. 226. Amend the sentence beginning "In all school dis - tricts," line 9, as far as "Provided," line 21, as follows: "In all school districts in this state where the board of education has not appointed a truant officer, as provided by law, the sheriff of the </seg>
            <seg id="p387">REVISION OF THE SCHOOL LAWS officer thereof ex-officio. In all such districts, any superintendent, principal, teacher or member of the board of education, or any other person, who shall know of any violation of the compulsory education law on the part of any child, or children of school age, their parents or the person or persons in actual or legal control of such children shall, as soon as possible, report such violation to the truant officer, who shall investigate said report at once, and, if necessary for the enforcement of the compulsory education law, shall give written notice to the person or persons violating said law to comply with its provisions; and if one week from the time such notices are given, such person or persons are still violating said law, then the said truant officer shall file a complaint against such person or persons before the county judge of the county charg - ing such persons with violation of the provisions of the law." Reason: The present law makes the county superinten - ent the truant officer in all districts where the board of ducation does not employ a truant officer. The county uperintendents of the state at their meetings have quite enerally expressed the idea that the sheriff should be the ruant officer of the county. In most counties the sheriff's uties are very few compared with those of the county uperintendent. The fact of the sheriff being the truant fficer will carry with it more weight than where that duty alls upon the county superintendent. Sec. 227. Amend by adding at the close "in addition to the costs thereto." Reaaon: It it a rule of common law that the losing party shall pay the costs in addition to the fine. ARTICLE XX SCHOOL FUNDS Sec. 231. Amend the clause beginning, "and within twenty days," line 5, as follows: "and within twenty days thereafter the state superintendent shall make the apportionment of the funds to such counties as follows, to wit: One-fourth of the whole amount shall be divided equally among the districts of the state and shall be distributed to the counties according to the number of districts as shown by the report last returned from the county superintendent; and the remaining three-fourths shall be apportioned to the counties according to the pro rata enumeration of scholars in each county last returned from the county superintendent. The state superin - tendent shall certify the amount of the apportionment c-f both the one-fourth and the three-fourths of said state school fund to the county superintendent of the proper county and to the state auditor, who shall draw a warrant on the state treasurer in favor of the </seg>
            <seg id="p388">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT various counties for the amount so specified by the state superin Reason: Under the present law the state superinten - ent apportions the entire amount to the counties on he basis of school population. The county superintendents hen apportion one-fourth of the amount received from the tate superintendent equally among the districts of their espective counties. A few figures will show how the thickly &gt;opulated counties have the advantage. In Douglas County he entire amount of the May 1914 apportionment was 38,787.60. One-fourth of this, or $9,696.90, divided by 63, he number of districts in the county, gave thr pro rata hare per district of Douglas county $153.95. Wheeler ounty received only $734.93. One-fourth of this, or $183.73, ivided by 40, the number of districts in the county, gave he pro rata share per district of Wheeler county $4.59. 'he entire state apportionment for May 1914 was $349,254. - 6, one-fourth of this, or $87,313.64, divided by 7,185, the ntire number of districts in the state, would make the mount apportioned to each district $12.15. Sec. 232. Amend the entire section as follows: "The several county superintendents shall immediately and within twenty days after receiving such apportionment divide the whole amount as follows: to wit; They shall deduct from the total amount received, the amount shown to have been apportioned direct to said districts by the state superintendent. To the balance of said apportionment they shall add all moneys received by the county treasurer on account of fines and licenses and* this sum total shall be distributed to the several districts of the county pro rata according to the average daily attendance last returned by the directors of the various districts. The total apportionment of each district shall bt its share in the direct apportionment made by the state superin - tendent for each district, together with its pro rata share of the balance of the amount of the state apportionment added to the amount received from fines and licenses, and no district, city or village, which shall have failed to sustain a school for the length of time required by law shall be entitled to receive any portion of the Reason: The present reading of the above section em )owers the county superintendents to divide the state ap - jortionment as follows: to wit; One-fourth to be distributee tqually among the districts of the county and the remaining three-fourths to be apportioned pro rata according to the school census. The reasons for instructing the state superin tendent to make the one-fourth division are indicated in *he argument following See. 231. By apportioning the remaining three-fourths sent to the respective counties upon average daily attendance rather than school enumeration we are offering an incentive for belter attendance. Sec. 237. Amend by adding the following provision: "Pro </seg>
            <seg id="p389">Bthat such funds shall be deposited in accordance with epository law and that the interest shall revert to the fund." b Reason: Under the guarantee act the funds will be rfectly safe and the district should have the advantage of e interest. ARTICLE XXI MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS ■ 243. Amend by striking out, "and at least one-half mile P to the school house in an adjoining district," in lines three our. Reason: There are numerous cases in the state where children are so located geographically that the "half mile nearer" provision deprives them of the right of transfsr to a graded school. It ought to be made easy for the child to have the best school privileges possible. ARTICLE XXII SCHOOLS IN CITIES OF OVER FIFTEEN HI MiRKU INHABITANTS Sec. 251. Amend the entire section, making it read as follows: "The boards of education contemplated by this article shall consist of six members who shall be elected upon a general ticket from among the legal voters who are taxpayers at the time for holding the general city election in each year. At the first election in cities organized under this article two members shall be elected for the term of three years, two for two years and two for one year, and annually thereafter two members shall be elected for three years and until their successors are elected and qualified and installed in office: Provided, in cities of the first class having a population of more than five thousand, and less than twenty-five thousand in - habitants, the board of education shall consist of five members who shall be qualified electors of said city and shall be actual taxpayers therein, who shall be elected at the times and hold their offices for the terms hereinafter prescribed, to wit: at the first regular city election held in any such city after this act has gone into effect, two members shall be elected for a term of two years, two for a term of four years, and one for a term of six years, and biennially thereafter their successors shall be chosen for the term of six years, and all members so elected shall serve until their successors are duly elected and qualified: Provided further, in cities of the first class having a population of more than forty thousand and less than a hundred thousand the board of education shall consist of six members who shall be elected in the manner following: At the general city elec - tion to be held in the year 1915, and every six years thereafter, there shall be elected two members of the board of education for a term of six years. At the general city election to be held in the year 1917, and every six years thereafter, there shall be elected two </seg>
            <seg id="p390">members of the board of education for a term of six years. At the general city election to be held in the year 1919, and every six years thereafter, there shall be elected two members of the board of educa - tion for a term of six years. The members of the board of educa - tion shall enter upon the duties of their office on the first Tuesday succeeding their election. In event of a vacancy among the members of the board of education, such vacancy shall be filled by nomina - tion by the mayor and confirmation by the city commission, and such appointment shall continue for the unexpired term. Reason: The present law reads that cities of the firs lass 'having a population of less than forty thousand am lore than five thousand may at the option of the -choo istrict have a board of nine members; and it further pro ides for elections in such a manner that cities under th ommission form of government may have a majority o he board retiring at once. It is desirable to have the schoo &gt;oard so that only one or two members go out at each elec ion. Sec. 273. Add a sixth provision as follows: "Sixth. In warrants to their own issue." Reason: This may now be done in cities and is often found to be quite helpful. The advantage should be ex - tended to people who live in the rural districts, thus giving them the advantage of the interest arising from their own funds. It is also desirable to keep school warrants at par. NEW LEGISLATION Statutory Provision* for Taxation A tax of five per cent of the gross receipts from water power projects in the state under state- franchise to be invested in per - manent school funds. Reason: The commission has investigated the reports of various experts on the estimated cost of producing elec trical power from the water power which it is possible to develop in the future of this state. They have found tha the highest estimate cf cost of production is $50.00 per kilowatt per year, the lowest estimate $30.00 per kilowat per year. They have found that the State Railway Com mission estimates that it costs to produce the same amoun of power from coal $81.00 per year. They believe, therefore that a five per cent tax on the gross income from such pro - ceeds would not be an unreasonable increase in the cost, for taking the highest estimated cost of producing by wate power and adding five per cent, the consumer would still b saved $28.50 per kilowatt per year, or a saving of thirty-fiv per cent over the present cost of producing such power. The commission further believes that the water power belongs to all the people in the state and that all the people in the state are entitled to some returns for the privileges which they have granted to a few. </seg>
            <seg id="p391">This five per cent tax on the water power, devoted to school purposes, would distribute the benefits derived from the development of the state's water power to every corner of the state and would prove of direct advantage to every citizen of the state. A tax sufficient to wipe out indebtedness in insolvent schoo' districts, said districts to be named in the bill. ' Reason: In some of the weak districts of the state the maximum levy of thirty-five mills plus the present aid from the state will do little more than maintain a seven months school. Some of these districts have a debt of several hun dred dollars and under present conditions their prospect o getting out of debt seems to be hopeless unless the state comes to the rescue. ■Phe levy of a two mill state tax for the support of the school tax to be distributed with the state apportionment. Reason: The flat two mill state levy advocated by the commission will, in a measure, distribute the taxes for schoo jurposes, derived from the large corporations doing business n the state, more equitably throughout the state. At the &gt;resent time, the railroads, the large insurance companies and large mercantile concerns and manufacturing plants, al - hough deriving their income from all parts of the state, pay school taxes only in the local districts in which they happen o be situated. This flat two mill levy would tend to dis - ribute these taxes more evenly. IIIUUIC tllt»V VUAVU ■■■»&gt;*' WTWtaij. At first thought, some people in the larger cities migh object to this, but, when they realize that a large number o :heir future citizens will come from the country, they wil appreciate the fact that it is to their advantage that the schools out in the state be brought to as high a state o efficiency as possible. tThis two mill state levy will assist materially in bringing bout this condition. Re-Appraisement of School Lands Board of Public Lands and Buildings shall re-appraise all school lands at the expiration of the present contract as follows: Land shall be appraised at five times the average assessed value of the land in the township in which said lands are situated. If sufficient proof is submitted by the special agent for the state, or by any party interested, the board may alter such appraise - ment, making it just and equitable. Reason: Most people familiar with the appraisement of the public school lands from which the state school funds are derived, will realize that many of these lands are ap - praised at figures far below their value and do not bring to the state the income that they should. EThe plan proposed for re-appraisement takes this atter out of the hands of local politicians and places it _ &gt;on a scientific basis. </seg>
            <seg id="p392">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT County High School The idea embodied in the County High School Law, enacted in 1913, is sound. An open way should be made for the establishment of county high schools wherever local conditions demand them. This is particularly true in the western counties. We favor such legislation as will secure this privilege in a constitutional manner to counties desiring the same. Reason: The county high school law seems the only way whereby high school advantages can be offered boys and girls in some of the sparsely settled counties of western Nebraska. We refer to the Kimball County High School as an example of what can be done along the line of a county high school. Medical Inspection The recommendation of the enactment of a law designed to secure medical inspection through the State Board of Health and the State Superintendent's office, which shall provide for one or more competent inspectors attached to the State Board of Health. Reason: When the state compels parents and guard ians to send children to school, the state is under obligation to protect the health of such children and to guard them against infections and contagions. To conserve the healtl of its citizens is as important for the state's welfare as to promote their intelligence. For the state to invest mone; for medical inspection and even necessary medical treatmen of children who would otherwise be neglected and hence b rendered inefficient and unable to care and provide fo themselves as adults, is immeasurably better from every standpoint than to invest in poor-houses. Let the matte of medical inspection in schools be put under the directio and control of the state board of health which now control matters relating to quarantine against contagions. In th school may be found children from a home where sanitatio and medical treatment are neglected who may, as carrier of contagions, inoculate all the other children from homes where the utmost care is exercised. The purpose of medica inspection should be to detect and prevent spread of con tagious diseases, to discover physical defects in their incipien stages and to prescribe and enforce sanitary regulations Medical inspection may be very properly based on th principle that "an ounce of prevention is better than pound of cure."

Reason: No modern invention exerts a greater in luence on the ideals, morals and intellect of the people han the moving picture show which is in every village town, and city throughout the country. Since it exerts such a powerful influence, it is a matter of grave moment whether the scenes thrown upon the screen for the millions in picture show audiences are of such a character as to be elevating or degrading in tone. In a majority of cases the scenes are such as to lessen respect for the most sacred institutions of civilization, such as suggest a disregard for law anc irder and even a violation of personal and property rights When youths say that at picture shows they learn how to ob houses or when lasses say they learn how to get free rom the marriage ties, it is time for the state to step for - ward with regulations forbidding the sensational, the lawless and the questionable scene to be displayed before audiences argely made up of youths and children. For a nation to &gt;ermit the pollution of its youth's ideals and morals by he improper suggestions portrayed by the sensationa moving picture, is to allow its very foundations to be under - mined and to invite its own downfall. The moving picture show may be a most potent factor for good when it exhibits that which appeals to the higher and better side. When it shows that which is noble and heroic, pure and sacred, beautiful and clean, then the moving picture is a factor for good which is deserving of encouragement and patronage.

Reason: In every community there are countless boys and girls who for some reason have not availed themselve* of the advantage of a high school education, and find them selves ill equipped to compete with their more fortunate companions. There are also hundreds of others who have not even completed an eighth grade course of study am find themselves hopeless in a "blind alley" job. The vocational educational bill is framed to meet the needs of these boys and girls, both in the city and in the country. In the city it is provided that boys and girls who must work may attend part time classes and secure specia vocational instruction. Furthermore, those boys and girl who are not through the eighth grade and who are too ol&lt; to go back to the grammar schools, may attend these voca tional schools profitably and will be associated with boy and girls of their own age, and thus not discouraged a they would otherwise be if they had to go back to schoo with children ten or eleven years their junior. The vocational schocl in the country running a shor time during the winter months will be opened to those boy and girls who cannot attend high school the full term am thus could not keep up with the high school classes. It wi also be the favored school of those "big boys and girls who have stopped attending the rural school because the are so old and yet so far behind many who are muc younger than they. It will be the school for the older boy and girls who have to help at home in the fall and spring. The vocational school will leave the present gradec school free to fulfill its function of training its pupils to be - come independent thinkers endowed with the culture o listory, literature, etc., and trained to high motives. I will not expect the common school teacher to be an exper agriculturist, an expert domestic science teacher, an exper irimary teacher, etc. It will leave to the common school th cultural pre-vocational work and will yet supply a ver necessary demand. By combining the rural high school, the consolidate schools and the rural-vocational school, there is economy or a rural high school pupil can very profitably take ad vanced vocational courses at the same time that his less ortunate brother is taking his vocational work. The rura or city high school with vocational courses cannot, how ever, meet the need of the boy who has not an eighth grade diploma nor of the city boy who cannot attend all day, no of the boy who cannot attend the country school in the spring and fall. This bill provides for the acceptance of Nebraska's share of the proposed $3,000,000 annual national appropriation fo the benefit of vocational education, and conforms in its pro - visions substantially to the requirements of the propose national act. In another part of this report the commission has recommended the establishment of a State Board o Education. The national law provides that any state board may be designated as a State Board of Education for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Smith-Lever Bill. </seg>

Reason: Ell wood P. Cubberley, Professor of Education .eland Stanford Junior University says: "A county unit o rganization and administration with a county school boarc epresenting the people; supervision placed on an educa ional, instead of a political basis, and made effective: th ubordination and consolidation of the districts, on the ini iative of a central authority, and according to a constructiv nd unified educational plan; adequate funds for the neces ary support of the schools, drawn from state and county axation, with permissive local taxation for buildings ani xtra educational efforts; and a system of apportionmen which recognizes the unit of cost of the school, and whicl places a premium on efficiency and attendance; these are the main essentials of the plan. It closely resembles the organi ation found most effective by the cities, and aims to pro uce a school system in the country as effective in preparini or country life as the city schools are in preparing for cit' Ife. There can be little doubt that such a central board, omposed of citizens of the intelligence, ability, and personal haracter necessary to secure election at a time when parti - an politics and party tickets do not cloud the judgment, and ealing with the county's educational needs as a whole, ?ould provide much better schools for all than ever will be one by district authority." One of the arguments which has been advanced against the county unit is the assertion that it is undemocratic. At first thought this might seem so, but a moment's con - sideration will, we believe, convince one that the county unit system of rural school administration is the most demo - cratic so far devised. The test of democracy of any public institution requires, first, a clear-cut knowledge of what the object of that insti - tution may be. If the investigation discloses that the institu - tion is performing its function and accomplishing its pur - pose in a democratic fashion, that institution is democratic. Let us, therefore, inquire as to what is the purpose of the rural school system. The rural school system is main - tained for the purpose of granting an equal opportunity, so far as education is concerned, to all boys and girls in the country. Let us take first the present rural school system. Can you call the present system democratic when you know that under it some boys in the state of Nebraska are able to ob - tain a nine months' school with a competent teacher in a well-equipped schoolhouse, while other boys and girls must be satisfied with five or six months of school under a poorly paid teacher in a schoolhouse little better than a cattle-shed? And, when upon further investigation you discover that the father of the boy who is securing the best advantages is paying only a 5 or 6 mill tax, while the father of the boy who has such a scanty education is pay - ing the limit of taxation, you will realize that the present school system is undemocratic in that it does not give equal opportunities to all the hoys and girls in the state of Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p407">KK VISION OF THK SCHOOL LA US bratka, and it does not distribute the burden of taxation equally upon their parents. Let us now look at the county unit system. Here is a ystem in which the tax burden of the entire community s distributed evenly over the entire county, where the funds ierived from those taxes are distributed where they are needed, where the boys and girls in one part of the county eceive the same length of term as the boys and girls in he other part of the county, where the same equipment is urnished one boy as is furnished his cousin in another part if the county, where competent instruction is given to all. t is not a system which gives to the few the best there is and the best is none too good for our boys and girls &gt;, while he others must be satisfied with a pittance. This brief com - parison clearly shows that the county unit system is more lemocratie than the present system of school administration. The argument has been advanced that the county unit system is not democratic because it does away with the local district board. This would be true were it not for the fact that the county unit system of administration has been so arranged under the bill proposed that the system would be readily re - sponsive to the will of the people. The Board of Administration is elected directly by the people. The counties are not so large but that the public ;an know personally and keep clsoe watch over the admin - stration of their school affairs. The counties are not so arge but that the people may know personally the officers who seek election. The counties are not so large but that any one with a complaint or suggestion may attend the neetings of the board, and, furthermore, there has been pro - vision made for a local director for each rural ?ehool, tlecte&lt; Dy the people, who shall be their representative before the board to see that the interests of their community are wel provided for.

            <seg id="p450">THE COUNTY UNIT The small school district as the unit of school supervision has been very satisfactory for those privileged to live in a town or city of sufficient size and assessed valuation to provide the means for maintaining an adequate school. But in the rural community, with few children, comparatively small assessed valuation, and long dis - tances from home to schoolhouse, the length of the school term has necessarily been short, the course of study abridged, the number of recitations multiplied, the length of the recitation period divided, and the consequent results not commensurate with the money and effort expended. About forty years ago, when I was yet a pupil in the country schools of Indiana, my father Solomon Delzell was a strong advocate of a township high school, but he was not able in his day to convert his friends and neighbors to the idea. Years later when I returned to the old home, I found the township high school plan in successful operation. But the real advantages of the larger unit of school supervision were not brought home to me forcibly until I visited the schools of Utah, at the time of the National Education Associa - tion in Salt Lake City in 1913. My observations of the practical working of a larger unit of school supervision were so favorable that on my return home I set about making an extended study of the proposition. In the fall of 1913 I sent Miss Edith A. Lathrop, my rural school inspector, for a week's visit among the consolidated schools of Utah. I am pleased to give you her report just as she made it to me, and later published in part by the Middle-West School Review, Omaha. During the following spring, I sent Supt. A. V. Teed of Dixon county to inspect the consolidated schools of Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa; and Supt. F. A. Stech of Butler county to inspect and report upon the county unit system in vogue in Mis - sissippi, Louisiana and Tennessee. I also asked Supt. Alice Florer of York county to report on the county unit system of Tennessee. Their reports are also appended. The U. S. Bureau of Education has issued two rural school letters dealing with the larger unit of school organization, which make a valuable addition to our consideration of this topic. In the discussion of the rural school problem by various teachers' associations, county and state, the "county unit" has had con - siderable attention. So interesting and spirited have been the dis - cussions that investigations have been made by other educators. See the article on "The County Unit System," the result of the in - vestigation by Supt. 0. R. Bowen of West Point, published in the Nebraska State Journal, February 1, 1914; and the editorial in the </seg>

At the close of the discussion on county unit at the County Superintendents' Conference in Lincoln, January 19, 1914, it was moved by Supt. Willis of Adams county, and motion carried, that the state superintendent be appointed a special committee by the county superintendents to confer with the executive committee of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association relative to the raising of funds for this investigation of the county unit system in the counties where it is now in vogue, and if successful in this, that the superintendent together with the executive committee appoint a com - mittee of three, distributed over the state, to make this investigation. Ene of the topics given special attention by the School Code on Commission is the county unit, and it gives me pleasure lude in this article a draft of the proposed measure, which my hearty approval. In my estimation, the county unit is «t method yet proposed for solving the rural school problem. James E. Dei.-.kll. OBSERVATIONS IN UTAH SCHOOLS By Edith A. Lathro^ Published in the August. 1914, issue of the Mid-West School Review, Omaha. Nebrask In December, 1913, 1 visited schools in Salt Lake and I'tah is organized under the county Utah county the district ■ and a partial county consolida- ■;ies, Utah. Salt Lake county plan of administration, while in ■erative for elementary schools for high school purposes. Ifhe county unit law for school administration came into in Utah in 1905. Since that time seven of the twenty - lies of the state have adopted county unit. In twelve of the ty-seven counties, county unit would be impossible because the il population is below the minimum i 2,000 ■ required. The department has recommended that this restriction in popula - be obliterated. Briefly the method of procedure in organizing under county unit is as follows: The county must contain a school population of over two thousand, outside of cities of the first and second cla. - majority of the voters must petition the county commissions - organize as a county school district if the first class; the commis - sioners are empowered to divide the county into not more than nine nor less than five precincts each of which shall be represented by a school board member. These board members are elected at a special school election for a term of four years. This board has general control of the school affairs of the entire county. It is the duty of this board to choose the county superintendent. </seg>
            <seg id="p452">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT On December 15, 1904, proceedings were begun which resulted in the division of Salt Lake county into two districts, known as Granite and Jordon. This is the only county in the state which is divided for consolidation purposes. Granite district occupies approximately the north half of Salt Lake county, exclusive of the corporate limits of Salt Lake City. It contains nineteen grade buildings and one high school plant. A central office at Granite contains offices for the county superintendent, clerk of the board, special supervisors, and store rooms for school property and supplies. These offices are distributing centers for the district as well. A visit to the Burton and Blaine grade buildings showed types of the newer school buildings in Utah. The noticeable thing about these buildings is the wide halls. All the space, ordi - narily used in narrow cloak rooms, is occupied in the main hall. Racks at the ends of the hall accommodate the pupils' wraps. These wide halls are especially desirable in promoting indoor games, marches and folk dances. The Granite high school contains a large, modern, brick building and two smaller buildings where shops and labora - tories are housed. The library contains a thousand volumes. Thor - oughly equipped laboratories in chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, physiology, enable the students to pursue these studies to the best advantage. This high school prided itself on having the best shop equipment for woodwork in the state. A modern kitchen and serv - ing room offers the girls opportunity for skillful training in the duties of home making. A modern gymnasium, eighty by sixty-four feet, together with a foot-ball field, a base-ball diamond and a quarter mile cinder track offers excellent opportunities for physical develop - ment. In examining the course of study for the Granite High School it was found that the courses were built in keeping with the present tendency to make schools practical and at the same time give its students that culture and refinement that should characterize the twentieth century American. Latin and German are the lan - guages given. The course is largely elective. One-third of the pupils in the high school came from a distance. These pupils provide their own means of transportation. A large shed on the school grounds accommodated the horses and vehicles. One boy came nine miles on his motorcycle. The Jordon district comprises the south half of Salt Lake county and like the Granite district is a consolidated county school district of the first class. It has been consolidated since 1905 and has a board of five members. There are seventeen grade schools and two high schools. Twenty-five wagons haul the grade children to school and two stages are used to transport high school pupils. Nearly seven hundred dollars per month is paid for the transportation of these grade children. ■ visit to the Sandy School, one of the new grade buildings, an enrollment of over three hundred pupils. A grade school tra here showed excellent musical skill. The Midvale school </seg>
            <seg id="p453">had two grade buildings on the same campus and accommodated over four hundred children. Special promotions were the rule over the entire district. The Union school is a strictly rural school and practically all the children are transferred in covered wagons. The janitor in this district called attention to his schedule that was posted in a prominent place in the hallway, and remarked that he could not get along without it. This schedule showed the janitor's program for every hour of the day, Saturday included. We found the buildings in the Jordon district excellently kept. This was due in a large measure to the splendid organization of janitors inaugurated by Supt. Orson Ryan. The janitors at their meetings discussed topics relating to the sanitation and care of school property. Super - intendent Ryan called our attention to the fact that the janitor who had praised the scheme to us, had been in the beginning one of the greatest opposers to the system. Ehe operation of county unit in the Jordon district had meant e increase in the enrollment. Eighty and six-tenths of the population were enrolled in school. The amount paid school &gt;s had been reduced one-half. A three days tour of inspection over Utah county was made in company with County Supt. J. Preston Creer, Mr. John C. Muer - man, one of national rural school specialists, and Miss Ella Murphy, primary supervisor of the south end of Utah county. This county is approximately thirty by forty miles. Its school population is 10,400 and its valuation exclusive of Provo is seven millions. About ninety per cent of the teachers are native born and about seventy - five per cent are members of the Mormom Church. Eighty-five per cent of the children are of Mormon parentage. Ninety per cent of the eighth grade graduates enter high school. Special promotions are the rule in the entire county. Utah county is operative under con - solidation only so far as its high schools are concerned. Each com - mon school district has its own set of trustees. There are twenty - two common school districts in Utah county, fourteen in the south end and eight in the north end. The districts of the south end have hired an art supervisor and a primary supervisor who supervise the schools of the fourteen districts along their special lines. Four of the larger districts of the south end have special music directors and district superintendents. The districts of the north end are doing practically the same thing with the exception of the primary supervisor. Each end of the county provides for three agricultural experts who not only teach in the high schools, but supervise the grade work as well. The fourteen common school districts of the south end of the county comprise what is known as the Nebo High School district and the eight in the north end comprise the Alpine High School district. Each of these high school districts is governed by a board of trustees consisting of one member of the board of each of the com - mon school districts comprising the high school district. The county </seg>
            <seg id="p454">Etendent is ex-offieio member of each board. These high offer complete courses in manual training, domestic science, ic art, type-writing, accounting and music besides the work ily given in high school curricula. Our first visit in Utah county was made at the Thurber school. This is a grade building in Spanish Fork where children from the surrounding country are transported at public expense. We next visited Leland, a one room rural building of box car type. The first four grades are taught here. Children in the district above this grade, living over three miles, are transported to Spanish Fork. In tbis rural school one of the best teachers of the county has charge of the twenty-five children in the first four grades. We drove back to Spanish Fork where we visited the consolidated high school. The building is a new $48,000 structure equipped with a gymnasium, swimming pool, shower baths, manual training and domestic science rooms. German is the only language taught. About one-third of the pupils are transported from rural districts. The girls of the domestic science class entertained us at a delightful luncheon. In the afternoon we visited the grade building at Salem and the high school at Payson. This latter building was a duplicate of the one at Spanish Fork. Wagons transported pupils from the rural districts. That evening the teachers of the south half of the county met at Spanish Fork for an informal meeting and reception. The next morning was spent in visiting the grades and high school at Springville. Under the direction of Mr. Robinson, the music director, the schools here have gained a national reputation in chorus singing. We were privileged to hear a girls' chorus sing "The Rosary." It was this chorus that so charmed the teachers at the National Education Association at Salt Lake City in the summer of 1913. The high school at Springville has a wonderful collection of oil paintings. What wonder that this little village, nestled at the foot of most enchanting mountain scenery, develops artists! Here a four course luncheon was served by the girls of the domestic science class. Ki the afternoon we drove through the Lincoln consolidated t. Five small districts have consolidated and now maintain ade buildings and a high school which carries the work through nth grade. KDur next stop was Pleasant Grove which is situated in the midst renty thousand acres of most fertile fruit gardens. It has a fine grade building in addition to its substantial high school building, ibstantial and attractive six course dinner was served at six :k by the girls of the domestic science class. The next morning was spent in American Fork where we visited both the grades and high school. Here we met an interesting gentle - man in the person of Mr. Forbes, secretary of the school board. He is eighty-four years old and taught the first free school in Utah. </seg>

On the schools into a larger group was Klate a teacher in a one room ry a marked tendency to unit ed. of teachers is high in Itah. The standard of qualification Teachers in the grades are required to have at least a four year high school or its equivalent and in addition thereto must pass an examination in psychology and the history of education. High school teachers must hold college degrees. The majority of high school teachers visited had been graduated from either the Brigham Young University or the University of Utah. It was not uncommon to find one who had studied in the East. The principal of the Granite High School had taken his master's degree from Columbia and the county superintendent of the Granite district had taken his master's degree from Chicago University. Bdate of December 20. 191 - of county unit: has the following to say of the A number of counties hav&lt; olved very well the administration all their former districts into one problem by the consolidation of unit. By this plan funds are secured from the wealthier parts of the county with which to aid the schools in the less wealthy lo - calities. Such consolidation results in the election of capable men for boards of education. It results, too, in the appointment of superintendents and supervisors of recognized educational standing. It makes possible the wholesale, and therefore, economic purchase of school supplies, and it insures a business-like administration throughout. In fact, schools in the consolidated counties have practi - cally all of the advantages enjoyed by schools in the cities, and, in ad - dition to these, the children have the advantages of rural life. Since 1905 seven counties have consolidated their former districts into school districts of the first class. These are Boxelder, Cache, Davis, Morgan, Millard, Sevier and Weber. Salt Lake county, with a greater population, has consolidated its former districts into two cience cla Deputy Supt. A. C. Mathesm in an article in the Deseret I </seg>
            <seg id="p456">tion possible with a smaller population than was required thereto - fore, and as the system has resulted in increased efficiency in school administration, it appears probable that other counties will take advantage of the plan." I he late Superintendent Nelson says in his biennial report for "Consolidation has not only passed the experimental stage ah, but a very large part of our citizens are enthusiastically or of it. No consolidated county would return to the small ystem. The larger unit is superior to it. It makes for economy ficiency in every department." And again in the same report he says: "In a democracy such as ours every child in the state, as nearly as possible, should have equal educational advantages. In our consolidated school districts. much better opportunities are offered to pupils; and one of the distinguishing features of educational strength in such districts lies in superior supervision." EIn his biennial report for 1910 he quotes the following from one the county superintendents of a county organized under county t: "The tax levy allowed by law under consolidation is smaller than it was before the county was consolidated into one district, yet under consolidation a very material growth has been made with - out any additional debt being created. With better buildings and graded schools we are able to command a better teaching force. Higher remuneration is offered to teachers who hold state certificates and diplomas. The care that is now exercised in the handling of the public school funds is an argument within itself for consolidation. ■'Meetings are held with the janitors of the district in which are instructed how to care for the school property. "Thanks to consolidation, which has made it possible for music to be taught to every school child in the county." Before leaving the state I asked Deputy State Superintendent Matheson to direct me to the superintendent of a county organized under the unit system who had worked out some statistics on the benefits derived from the consolidation of a county under a single board. He said, "I wish you would go into Weber county." It was then on the verge of the holiday vacation and not possible for me to stay longer. On my return to Lincoln I wrote Superintendent Petterson of Weber county telling him what I wanted and his report concludes this article. It will be noted that Weber county saved enough in one year on school supplies to pay a county superintendent more than is paid at present to any county superintendent in Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p457">the county rxiT SOME OF THE BENIFITS DERIVED FROM CONSOLIDAI Supplies All school supplies are purchased from supply houses direct instead of buying from traveling salesmen. The amount needed is determined and bids called for; the different dealers figure on the amount and give their lowest prices. The deal goes to the lowest responsible bidder and he contracts to furnish the schools of the county. Heretofore traveling salesmen have charged from twenty-five per cent to two hundred per cent more than we have been able to buy the same goods for from supply houses direct. Weber county was saved during the school year of 1905-1906 about $2,300.00 on school supplies alone. Buildings — New school houses are built by contract instead of letting every man in the district have a hand in the deal. This insures better work and comes very much cheaper. All repairs of any great extent are done by contract; the smaller jobs are done by an " all-round-handy-man" who is paid by the day. Meeting — Under the old system it was absolutely impossible to get a meeting of a majority of the trustees in the county to discuss school matters. Under the present system the Board of Education meets every Saturday morning with the superintendent where conditions in every school in the county are discussed. Where there is any trouble it is properly adjusted. The superintendent hears from every school in the county once a week aside from hi? personal visits. Instead of merely complying with the law by visiting each school twice during the school year, he visits where he is most needed. During the school year of 1905-1906 some of the schools were visited as many as twelve times. The superintendent reports to the Board the results of his visits. Taxes Under consolidation there is a uniform tax through - out the county, where before the tax varied from one and a half to fifteen mills. Under the old conditions one district with about $475,000.00 worth of corporate property could run its schools nine months on a one and a half mill tax and at the end of the year have money in the treasury, while in another district with no cor - porate property a levy of fifteen mills was made and the school was closed at the end of seven months for wants of funds. Two large corporations paid into the school fund over $6,500 in 1905-1906 while under the old system they escaped with $1,125. Under con - solidation all schools have the same length of school year and all children in Weber county have the same chance. Under consolida - tion the wealthy corporations are taxed equally with the poor farmer for the support of the public schools. Teachers — Teachers for the entire county are employed by the Board of Education. They are required to sign uniform contract* prepared by the Board. Each teacher has a copy of a school manual prepared and sent out by the Board which contains rules and regula- By Supt. W. N. Peterson, Weber County, Utah </seg>
            <seg id="p458">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT tions for the schools and defines clearly the duties of principals, teachers, pupils and janitors. One week's salary is held bark to insure a faithful performance of duty. The Board deals with all teachers in the county which does away with the old custom of teachers going from district to district bidding for higher salary. Deserving teachers are recognized and given an increase in salary. This insures better teachers and better service. Under the present system teachers are graded as well as pupils. Teachers who are particularly adapted for the primary work are placed in the primary grade, and those better fitted for grammar grade work are placed in the grammar department. Under the old system with all grades in the one room, teachers were obliged to handle all classes of children whether they were adapted for the work or not. This was an in - justice to the teacher and a decided injustice to the children. In the graded school the teacher divides her time between two classes, with a thirty-minute recitation period; while in the un - graded school she divides her time among eight grades with a seven - minute recitation period. Thus it is evident that the children in the grade schools have the advantage. Since the consolidation of Weber county schools into one school district, fourteen of the old unsanitary buildings where ungraded schools were held have been abandoned and the children transferred to the larger sanitary build - ings where they receive the benefits of grading. Well-fitted, roomy, comfortable wagons, built for the purpose, pass the homes of the children and convey them to the schools on time; tardiness to a great extent is done away with. In nearly every instance where a school has been closed the children are transported to the larger school at a cost of about $35 a month, and the services of a $55 teacher dispensed with. The children are distributed through the grades in the larger school without requiring any addition to the teaching force. This is a saving of $15 a month in addition to a saving of $10 a month for coal and janitor service. Institutes — The superintendent and primary supervisor have direct charge of the school work. The schools are divided into two departments. Miss Matilda Peterson has charge of the primary grades and Superintendent Peterson directs the grammar grade work. Institute meetings are held once a month on a regular pay-day. Once in two months a general meeting is held where matters of general interest are discussed, and once in two months department meetings are held where different phases of school work are handled. Under the able direction of Miss Peterson the primary work has become a special feature in the Weber county public schools. The construction work and the raffia work done under her supervision are certainly creditable. School critics who viewed this work at the Weber county fairs praised it highly. Albert J. Powell is the supervisor of music in all the schools. This department is a credit to the system. The music in the Weber county schools is attracting the attention of school critics throughout the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p459">The schools throughout the county are in excellent condition. Below is a comparative price list showing prices paid on a few articles by Weber county before and after consolidation. THE COUNTY UNIT Rural School Letter No. 11 1. U. S.

October 1, 1914 A unique form of district organization is in vogue in the northern part of Minnesota. While the southern half of the state early became split up into many small, independent districts, the northern part of the state, which was slower to develop on account of the great pine forests, has had quite a different history. When a county was first organized it formed one school district or, to be more exact, the part of the county which was first settled became the school </seg>
            <seg id="p461">district and the unpeopled portion of the county formed unorganised school territory. In many of these counties as soon as clearings were made in the forest, the school authorities of the settled section would extend educational advantages to the new part. In this way, by degrees, the school district grew as the county filled with settlers. Iieveral of these counties have been able to retain all the • thus gained by outward expansion. In a few instances aspiring es have succeeded in tearing themselves away from the original 1 district. It is quite common, however, to find school dist • the control of one board having within its jurisdiction two or good-sized villages and a hundred or more outlying school- A good illustration of this is the Grand Rapids undivided districts in Itasca county. The district covers practically two-thirds of the very large county, and includes full;. quare miles. The county seat, Grand Rapids, is a place of some 2,500 inahbitants and forms the educational center of the district. Here is located the Central High School, with its normal department for the training of rural teachers for the district: a strong agricultural department; and a department of household economics, with another in manual training. Besides this large town, Cohasset, Blackberry, and several other villages lie within the district. One school board of three men elected at large from over the district, together with one local supervisor for each congressional township, administer the school affairs for the entire area. A capable school superintendent is ap - pointed by the board to have practical management of all the schools in the district. As a result of this organization, educational advantages are distributed uniformly over the entire district. The large towns and the remotest country communities are perfectly willing to continue under the one board. Every child has the opportunity of a high school education. The Central High School, to be sure, is at Grand Rapids; but the children are transported to the school at public expense, both from the nearby villages, and from the country. In the many instances where children from rural communities live too far away to be transported by wagon, the district pays from $7 to $10 for each child for board and lodging per month while attending school at Grand Rapids. Rural schools are constructed wherever they are necessary and nowhere else. As soon as a new community is settled in a fresh clearing, the school board builds a new schoolhouse. In some in - stances, portable schoolhouses are in use. If there are only two or three children in a newly developed section of the district, the board pays the parents a sum of money sufficient to board the children while attending school in some neighboring district rather than build a schoolhouse. If it is impracticable to bring the schoolhouse to the children, the children are brought to the schoolhouse. </seg>
            <seg id="p462">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT What appeals to the casual observer of these schools is that the poor sections of the district get just as good schoolhouses and as good teachers as the older and richer sections. The school year is nine months for all, and the teachers are paid an average salary of $55 a month. The furniture, books, and supplies are furnished by the district at large. This means that all the schools are treated equally well. A good library, manual training benches, cookery outfits, drinking fountains or individual cups are found in all these schools. The lighting is always good, and all the schools are provided with ventilating heating stoves. There is close supervision of the rural schools. A corps of super - visors go from the central school at Grand Rapids to all the village and one teacher schools. Thus, for example, the manual training in - structor, the domestic-science teacher, and agricultural supervisor, or their assistants, spend a certain number of hours each week with all the schools in the outlying districts. This means that the teacher of the little school is under the immediate direction of supervisors of the high school at Grand Rapids. It means satisfactory supervision and intelligent and efficient work. THE COUNTY UNIT SYSTEM (Published in Department of Nebraska Schools, Nebraska State Journal, February 1, 1914. Superintendent O. R. Bowen of West Point, having been an auditor in the classes of Dr. Moore, department of education, Har - vard University, summer session, 1912, and being impressed with his wonderful ability in matters pertaining to school administration, submitted to him the following questions relating to the county unit system. The questions and the replies to them are here given (1) Is the county unit system preferable to the district system? (2) How many members should there be on the county board? (3) How should they be elected? ■4) If elected, should they be elected by the whole county or d the county be divided into districts? ■5 1 Should there be special qualifications for members of the .? (6) What powers should they have? B) Should the board have power to go outside of the county in ng a county superintendent just as city boards do? Cambridge, Mass., December 28, 1913 B)ear Mr. Bowen: Replying to your several questions in the in which you ask them. (1) The phrase "district system" is in two senses, the first is of a single school with local manage - and control —the second is of a group of schools usually smaller </seg>
            <seg id="p463">in nu m oer indn inc counij out so rnt'ii mcs even liirjjer , lor purposes of supervision. I take your question is "Is the county unity s&gt; preferable to the district system?" using "district system" in the first sense. I think the county system is greatly to be preferred to the district system because it gives real school administration ir of incidental attention to the schools, because it brings to all ad - vantages which any of them may have worked out and becai. takes the schools out of the petty neighborhood quarreling from which they suffer in the district system. Their business can be and is better attended to and their work is standardized. (2)- The county board should be small rather than large. This plan of conducting schools attempts to apply the experience which has been gained in conducting city schools to the country. Thr board should have five, seven or nine members, the fewer the !&gt;• So that five is the best number. If the board is larger it will not be so easy to get high grade men to serve on it, individual responsibility will not be so clear and attendance upon the meetings will not be kept up. The small board is therefore much the !&gt;• I think they should be elected at large. This is the only way in which they can be made responsible to the people and in which the people can manage their own schools. If any one appoints them he has claims upon them and will stand between them and their responsibility to the people. (4) I think they should be elected by the whole county, as they should represent the school interests not of a locality or section but of the county as a whole. Localism and sectionalism we want to keep out. (S) I think there should not be special quali - fications. They should be the representatives of the people, sei by them to direct the management of their schools for them. If only those men who have teachers' certificates are selected the board will be made up of schoolmasters, which is distinctly not desirable. The people should be free to select whom they will. 6 They should have power to make by-laws, to define policies, to fix the amount of tax needed to maintain the schools, to appoint a county superintendent as their executive officer and approve or disapprove of the course of study, etc., etc. They are school officials only as they sit as a board and their function is to act as a board only, leaving the execution of their orders and decisions to their executive officer, the superintendent. All their orders should go to their sub - ordinates through the superintendent's office, save that any one at any time may be free to appeal any matter from his decision to the board for final determination. (7) Decidedly, the board should be free to get, and it should be its duty to get, the best available person to serve as general manager or superintendent of the schools. What they want and are elected to get for the people is the best educational management possible, not home industry, but the best directors of the schools. They must, therefore, be free and it must even be their duty to hunt outside the county and the state as well as in them for the best available talent for this purpose. What we want is free </seg>

You are entirely at liberty to publish this letter if you care to do so. What I should most strongly impress upon you is the very great importance of the interests of public education. I am satisfied that there is no branch of government which requires so much atten - tion as this. A good scheme of school administration will not of itself make good schools, but it will make them possible. Whereas a bad scheme of school administration will defeat the work of the best teachers and make good schools impossible. Very sincerely yours. Ernest C. Moore. RELIEVING ILLITERACY (Lincoln Dmily News, Oetober 26, 1914 The need of more and better rural schools in Nebraska is made manifest by conditions revealed in a recent census report showing the percentage of illiterates among the native white farming class of this state. The figures show that the percentage of illiteracy in the rural districts of Nebraska is twice as large as that in the cities and villages of the state. Nebraska has 18,009 illiterates and 11,428 of them live on the farms. There are 6,109 boys and men and 5,:H9 girls and women on the farms of this state that can neither read nor write. These are facts that should be borne in mind by the farmer members of the legislature next winter when they will be asked to adopt the county unit system for the schools. Under this plan it will be possible, without increasing the aggregate cost, to furnish better Bil facilities and better schools for the country districts. One n why the country makes the poor showing given in the above •a is that is tome sections of the state, either inability or unwill - m to spend enough money to get the best results has existed, condition must be changed in the public interest at least. THE UNIT SYSTEM (Editorial from Nebraska State Journal, February 16, 1914. E Meetings have been held in several Nebraska counties recently more will be held in the future to explain to the taxpayers the ntages of the new unit system of school organization. It is a er of much importance to all people interested in the rural ,1s. Bhe system contemplates giving to the rural schools the unified ement that is now the rule in the cities. If it were proposed </seg>
            <seg id="p465">are school buildings with a separate board and an independent set of teachers for each building, the proposition would be deemed un - thinkable. And yet that identical plan obtains in the rural schools of Nebraska today. The educational work of each county is split up into between fifty and one hundred districts, each managed by its own board. The only co-ordination in the school work of the county is effected through the county superintendent who holds a poorly paid political office and is able to look in on each school for an hour or two not more than two or three times a year. Under this lack of s&gt; the greatest variation exists in the quality of the instruction even in neighboring districts. One school may have nine months of school under good instruction. The neighboring school may run but - months under a poorly equipped teacher. The right of extreme local government involved in the district system is of course its foundation and its defense. It is time for the farmers of Nebraska to ask them - selves if they are not paying too much for even so precious a boon as the management of their local affairs. It is urged on behalf of the unit system that it puts at once all of the experience acquired in the management of the city schools at the disposal of the rural districts. A county school board is elected and serves without pay. This board chooses a county superintendent, who selects the teachers, subject to the approval of the board, and has general charge of the entire system outside of high school districts. Supplies are bought in bulk and distributed to all the schools at a considerable saving in expense. District lines may be crossed at the convenience of the pupils. Weak schools can be consolidated with others without expensive red tape. The school taxes throughout the county are made uniform. Professional standards are insisted upon and the result, it is claimed, is an increase in the efficiency of the schools out of all proportion to the expense involved. The plan looks so promising that it is at least worth studying with open minds. OBSERVATIONS IN ILLINOIS, INDIANA, AND IOWA By A. V. Teed, Superintendent of Dixon County To Hon. James E. Delzell, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- tion ■i accordance with your request, I visited the states of Iowa, i and Indiana, in March, 1914, to investigate rural school ions, and respectfully submit the following rsport: Iowa Brevious to the last session of the Iowa legislature, their school ions were be coming so unsatisfactory that in 1911 the - rs association appropriated $2,000 to defray the actual expenses </seg>
            <seg id="p466">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT of a commission to investigate the school conditions in their owr and other states and to report its findings and recommendations to the association. This commission was composed of representative citizens of the state engaged in farming, business, household duties and professional life, and was known as the "Better Iowa Schools Commission." This commission in turn, appointed nine sub-com - mittees and after much work and deliberation, drafted a report mak - ing twenty-three recommendations for proposed legislation. report of Better Iowa Schools commission i. Largely as a result of this agitation, new laws were passed cover- .ng the following: BA law governing school treasurers and providing for the t of district funds at interest on daily balances. 2. A teachers minimum wage law. 3. Provides that the state superintendent shall be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate for a four year term at a salary of $4,000 a year and gives him more help and increased powers and duties. 4. Provides for the election of county superintendents for three year term by the presidents of the school boards of the county extra qualifications for the county superintendent who need not be a resident and provides office help and traveling expenses. E. State aid for normal training in high schools. State aid to consolidated schools: A 2 room school receives $250 for equipment and $200 annually for maintenance. A 3 room school receives $350 for equipment and $500 annually for maintenance. A 4 room school receives $500 for equipment and $750 annually for maintenance. Khese schools must teach agriculture, home economics and il training. 7. Free high school tuition law. 8. Institutes to be held during the school year and teachers draw full pay while in attendance. All of these laws seem to be giving splendid results. The state superintendent and county superintendents will be out of politics. This freedom from politics, increased salaries, and office help and traveling expenses will make possible greater efficiency in super - vision. The state superintendent now has three efficient inspectors who are in the field organizing and directing the work. This strength - ening of supervision together with their new consolidation law should be of great interest to us. The new law for consolidation has tuken like wild fire. The state superintendent's office cannot supply the demand for consolida - tion meetings. While but sixteen such schools had been organized </seg>

The law provides that such districts must have a minimum of sixteen sections. The state department recommends from twenty-four to twenty-eight section?. The method of organiz - ing is very simple. The proposed boundaries are submitted to the county superintendent and when approved by him. the people within the boundaries vote as a unit and a majority is required to establish. The proposed boundaries may be brought before the state superintendent on appeal from the county superintendent. IJnder this law and the normal training law, Iowa is making erful progress in the teaching of agriculture, home economics manual training. This work will be an absolute requirement Iowa schools after July 1, 1915. Illinois Ellinois has a combination of the township and district system, ically all power is vested in the district board of three directors, g about the same control of school affairs within the dist Nebraska board, except that the school funds are in the hand - e township treasurer. The congressional township has an elec - board of three trustees who have charge of the distribution of arising from the school section of the township. They may also ;e district boundaries. Many of the schools in cities are gov - under special charters. A strong feature of the Illinois system is the township high school which is established by a vote of the township. At the present time 109 such schools have been establiihed. From Bulletin No. 8 of the University of Illinois School of Education, we find that these schools vary greatly in size and attendance. Many of them are really city high schools such as Evanston, Oak Park, and Trier, and have no rural attendance. Some of the smaller schools have a fair percentage of pupils from rural schools, while the average from the seventy-five schools reported in this bulletin is about fifteen per cent. When we consider the fact that this plan offers no relief to the children in the grades within its territory, and has such a small rural enrollment in the high school, we cannot believe that such an arrangement would be any improvement over the advantages offered by our free high school law. We might state that these schools are more necessary in Illinois due to the fact that four year high schools are not so plentiful in the smaller towns as they are in Nebraska. Etate Superintendent Blair believes in making the best possible f the materials at hand and has done a great work in the irdization of the single room schools of Illinois. Schools which ire up to certain standards in grounds, buildings, equipment, ization and teachers are approved by the county superintendent </seg>
            <seg id="p468">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT and the state inspector of rural schools. Such schools then receive from the state superintendent a diploma and a door plate bearing the words "Standard School." If the school can meet still higher re - quirements, it is approved as a "Superior School." To date, about 1,500 schools have been approved as Standard and some five or six as Superior. I visited some standard schools in Sangamon county and while they had splendid equipment and high priced teachers, who were making every effort to carry out the system of alternation as recom - mended in the Illinois course of study, I found the work no better than that done in many Nebraska schools by teachers working for a smaller salary and with less equipment. In spite of alternation, these teachers had from twenty-four to thirty-seven classes per day and about ten to fifteen minute recitations. I was informed that the county superintendent advised that the number be limited to twenty-eight classes per day which would give but twelve minutes for each class. In this county, about twenty per cent of the teachers are men and only eight per cent are beginning teachers. Two-thirds of the teachers in rural schools received $60 or better per month and eighteen per cent of them receive from $75 to $90 per month, yet even these fine plants and splendid teachers working with the best time saving course of study known, cannot get more than one-fourth to one-third of the time that is needed for recitations making no allowance whatever, for individual help. While the alternation scheme should enable a teacher to elimi - nate from one-half to one-third of the usual classes, all school au - thorities agreed that it was impossible to do high school work in the single room school except in schools where some of the grades were not represented. The following clipping from the "Sangamon School Interests," edited by County Superintendent Edgar E. Pruitt of Springfield, Illinois, shows the attitude of Illinois school officials: "The State Superintendent of Public Instruction has ruled that ninth and tenth year work, in order to meet the requirements of the law, must be approved by the county superintendent and accepted by some four year high school in the county. There are but very few country school districts which can offer such quantity and quality of matter and instruction as will meet the approval of the county superintendent or be accepted by any four year high school. It is very doubtful whether such work can be done in a one-room school without serious injury to the work in the lower grades." Bonsolidation is making no progress due to a court decision prevents the use of district funds for transportation.

He has an elective ad - board of three members who are the power behind the throne y control tax levies and appropriations. The trustees of the various townships with the presidents of the boards of city districts comprise a county board of education, having advisory powers over the entire county. This county board elects the county superintendent for a term of four years. This system of selecting the county superintendent gives splendid results for it takes the county superintendent out of politics, makes professional county superintendents, and relieves them from campaign expenses and the temptation to keep one eye on the political outlook and the other on the educational interests of the county. As a result, they get strong men for the office and retain them. One of the best county superintendents in the state remarked that he would not think of accepting that office if he had the bother and expense of a cam - paign every two years. The law provides for a local director for each school, but as he has practically no power, and consolidation is becoming so general, the people have quit filling the office, leaving all school management in the hands of the township trustees. Among the many good laws under which the schools of Indiana are working, may be mentioned: 1. A splendid minimum wage law 2. Compulsory abandonment of any school whose average daily attendance is twelve or are then transported to less for the year. These pupils iome other school. 3.

County superintendents are elected by county boar&lt;: education for a term of four years. The most striking feature in the Indiana school system is the great progress which is being made in consolidation. While they had splendid single room schools and many township high schools, they were not able to hold the boys and girls for high school and were not able to offer sufficient time nor a satisfactory course of study for the grades. The unit was also too small for the school to have any influence as a social center. Speaking of consolidation, State Superintendent Charles A. Greathouse, says: "This has brought into rural districts much needed supervision, industrial work, greater permanency in the teaching force, more experienced and able teachers, the use of the school as a social center and secondary education."

All school wagons are furnished by the district and are en - closed and heated by a furnace fastened under the wagon. On a zero morning, I walked one and one-half miles into the country to catch a school wagon and then rode five and one-half miles facing a north wind without discomfort. The driver told me that he had missed but one trip in five years, and that due to the floods of last spring. The wagons run on a regular schedule like a train. Children must come out to the road to meet the wagon. In our wagon were twenty-two children, the driver, the superintendent of the school and myself. The children seemed to enjoy the ride and lifted the roof with their songs. If a child complained of cold feet, the driver had him change places with a child sitting near the register in the floor of the wagon. This school, known as the "Breaks Consolidated," has been running since 1901 and is five and one-half miles from town. It has four rooms and a basement. They use six teachers regular and two township supervisors who teach part time. Departmental teaching is practiced from the sixth grade up. A four years high school course is offered with special instruction in music, art, cooking, sewing, agriculture and manual training. Sup*. F. D. Welch of this school, left a position in a city school to take this place at $300 less salary, because as he expressed it, "Of the chance to do things." This school is mentioned because it has been in operation thirteen years and is evidence that consolidation is not an experiment. Near the school is a splendid country church and it and the school form a social center for the community. Many of these schools run an eight months term which is the minimum for a commission laccredited) high school in Indiana. Some of the smaller schools have but seven months of school, but more work and better work is done in that time than is possible in the single room school with nine months. Many of these consoli - dated schools when located in the small towns, have splendid modern buildings, with excellent heating and ventilating systems, private water supply and drinking fountains, gymnasiums and large as - sembly rooms, i with stage! and used for numerous public gatherings which are invariably well attended. Some of these schools have bands, orchestras, glee clubs, athletic associations and other organiza - tions which make them the center of community interests. Every township in Montgomery county has a township superintendent who teaches part time in the schools of his township. Most of the schools report an average daily attendance of ninety-eight per cent of the enrollment. </seg>

SUGGESTIONS FOR NEBRASKA febraska has always held high rank as a school state, but present time we are in danger of losing our high rank u filers mt public sentiment can be aroused to keep us in line for growth. Briefly stated, the problem is to determine just remedy is needed for our faulty conditions and to get the sufficiently interested to finance the remedy. Kt is generally conceded that our colleges, normal schools and lited high schools are in a very satisfactory condition. True schools often feel the need of more money but this is the best evidence of their rapid growth and the needed funds are y provided, if their efficiency justifies the expense. Our great weakness, in common with most states, is the poor school advantages offered in the small towns and rural sections. They suffer from lack of supervision, poor teaching, crowded pro - grams, poor equipment, and neighborhood quarrels. El can offer no specific for all the ills of these schools, but will est that any Nebraska school community, outside of the sparsely ed regions, may have as good a school as it is willing to for. When the people demand better schools and provide funds, the better schools will follow. Ehile legislation cannot create this demand, it can make the ons easier for filling the demand, hence the following sug - s are made for new legislation: 1.

But few districts will make erence of more than five or ten dollars between the poores; ;rs and the best teachers. This offers no encouragement to tost skilled teachers. In many Illinois counties, country school &gt;s range from $40 to $100. 5. State standardization of rural schools. Many districts want the best but are not sure as to what is the best. I. Standardization or legislation should provide for better ngs and equipment and thus make the rural school plants attractive, more efficient, and safeguard the health of the en. t Legislation to encourage consolidation when practical. While resent single room school can be made more efficient than it e only relief for the crowded program and meager course of is consolidation. This will give high school privileges to ry children without taking them away from home. Such ition should establish the consolidated district upon a majority of the proposed district, offer state aid, and provide for eom - ry transportation. II, A better financial system might be provided for school . We might suggest a state tax to be apportioned, a plan by i the permanent school funds might be made to produce a t rate of interest — (In Indiana these funds are loaned locally must net six per cent) — and the apportionment be based upon il attendance.

            <seg id="p476">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT SCHOOLS OF LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI AND TENNESSEE David City, Nebr., May 11, 1914 Dear Sir: I beg to report as follows on school conditions in the states of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee: GENERAL 1. Most of the educational achievements are of recent date not exceeding the last decade. 2. In all these states some form of a county unit is in force. This is the logical and historic plan with the people of the south. In Tennessee this plan went into operation in 1907, and met with a great deal of opposition, but now seems to meet with universal satisfaction. In Mississippi and Louisiana, some modification of the plan has always existed. The New England town meeting had not its counterpart in the south, and hence the ease of inaugurating larger units for administrative purposes. 3. Consolidation of schools has made wonderful strides. There are four principal reasons for this: la) it can be easily effected by means of the county board; (b) its value has been thoroughly demonstrated; (e) the mode of settlement is such that transportation is made possible, and idj not a small portion of the increased burden of taxation is borne by non-resident property owners. Except as to legislation, the south has nothing to offer to help us solve the prob - lem of consolidation. If we must follow example, we must look to other states for suitable and similar types. ■. The whole school system is attuned to practical vital needs, is a striking feature of the course of study which is written in of country life. 5. The boys and girls club work is receiving a great deal of attention, and meeting with wonderful success. There are three chief reasons for this: iai I here is a great need for it; (bi the climatic and soil conditions are favorable ; and (e) the woik is under competent leadership. All of this wotk is carried on from the state superintendent's office, and is closely welded to the regular school 6. The agricultural high schools of Mississippi present con - spicuous examples of what can be done to make high school education universally available and intensely practical. The agricultural and domestic science courses are exceedingly strong. These institutions are real democratic peoples colleges. 7. The leadership of the south is in competent hands. Their long term of office, good salary, and freedom from interference makes it possible to achieve great things. 8. The rank and file of the teachers of the south has not as yet caught up with the spirit of their leaders, and when they do Hon. James E. Delzetl Lincoln, Nebr. </seg>
            <seg id="p477">states to stand in the very front rank of educational achievement. I My reception throughout the south has been of such a i nature that I would suggest that your department write state superintendents of the states of Mississippi and Louis - and thank them for their kindly treatment. I have already ally done so. PARISH UNIT LOUISIANA Khis letter from the state superintendent of Louisiana sets tersely the features of their plan. It is so complete that I i append it. "We have in this state what is known as the parish (county &gt; unit of school organization. Each parish selects a small board of school directors of from five to ten in number, which board is en - trusted with the complete management of the schools of the parish. The membership of the board is overlapping, one-third of the mem - bers going out of office every two years, the maximum term being six years. The board elects the parish superintendent who must be a teacher of proven ability for a term of four years. The board elects all teachers for the schools of the parish, city schools included, upon the recommendation of the superintendent. The board locates all school houses, and can at any time discontinue a school at a certain location, and re-establish a school at another. In other words the school board has absolute authority over the schools of the parish except in certain cases of a general nature, where the state board of education has authority. This state has made admir - able headway in the matter of consolidation of country schools, due very largely to the fact that the parish school board has the author - ity to determine the location of schools. We have a few more country schools that could be consolidated, but the principal obstacle in the way of consolidation in this state is not the indisposition of the people to place their children in better or larger schools, or the lack of authority in the school boards to consolidate small country schools, but to the fact that some of our roads are still bad and transportation is therefore a problem. There is a healthy sentiment in the state now in favor of good country roads, and when the different parishes have built good roads there will be no trouble to consolidate such schools as can still be consolidated. AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOLS OF MISSISSIPPI The agricultural high schools of Mississippi are the finest thing I have seen in my entire trip. These schools are organized by counties whenever there is a demand for them placed with the county board of education. The county board of education then asks the various towns of the country to submit propositions. This generally calls for a building large enough to do the school work and also a dormitory housing not less than 40 boarder". In cm«e </seg>
            <seg id="p478">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT there is no town willing to put up such an offer, the county board of education then submits the matter to the people authorizing a bond issue. These schools are also subsidized by the state, and can receive all the way from $15.00 to $25.00 a year, depending upon the enrollment. I am informed that every one of the 32 schools now operating is receiving the maximum limit. These schools now enroll 2,500 pupils. Most of these boys and girls come from the farms. At two of the schools that I visited, I asked the question how many of them would have attended the regular high school, and although the enrollment in each was more than 140, the number of hands in either case did not exceed 20. The courses of study in these schools are intensely practical, each school must have from 20 to 60 acres of land, and on this practical farming is carried on by the schools under the supervision of the instructor in agriculture. I visited two of these schools, one at Ellisville, and the other one at Poplarville. Each of these schools enroll about 190 students, and in every case at least two-thirds of them were country boys and girls. Each school has a dormitory, and the average cost to the boys and girls for room and board is $5.80 a month. A good many of the boys and girls work their way through. This makes it possible for every boy and girl who has any aspiration, to get an education. Each student enrolled is required to devote two hours each week to some work on the farm or in the kitchen. The farm produces practically everything that it consumes, including the vegetables for the table. These schools serve as experiment stations for the various counties, and the farmers seem to be in perfect sympathy with this form of education. The home life that these institutions present is some - thing that is purely wholesome. The principal has a home in con - nection with the school, and the whole institution becomes one great family. The men and women teaching in these schools, while most of them are native borne, are for the most part graduates of those colleges. The domestic science is carried on in an intensely practical way. The remarkable feature about all these schools is, that the students are actually required to do the practical work, and no one is excused. Quite a number of these boys and girls when they graduate from these schools go out and teach in the one room school. It will be but a short time before these institutions will not only supply a practical education for the farm and farm home, but likewise train a goodly number of young people to teach in the rural schools. These agricultural high schools are not agri - cultural high schools only in name, but in fact. The entire atmo - sphere is one of the farm. Kam preparing an exhaustive report dealing with the organiza - state, county and district of the three states I have visited, with the source of revenue for school purposes, likewise the lidation and vocational work. I have also collected a large er of photographs which I am going to append to that report. </seg>
            <seg id="p479">THE COUNTY UNIT I would summarize my report as follows: ■ We have much to learn from the south in the matter of tion, but we must be exceedingly careful to take into consider - the temperament of our people and local conditions. KWe can take notable examples from the south as to making tion practical, and reducing it down to the basis of the every roblems of life. ■ The agricultural high schools of Mississippi, deserve careful leration because they are not high schools featuring agricul - work, but agricultural high schools featuring culture. 4. There are no better teachers than the teachers of Nebraska, and to consider the wonderful work we are doing in the conditions under which they do it, makes me feel that with the proper organ - ization we can well maintain first place among all the states of the Very respectfully yours F. A. Stech County superintendent. COUNTY UNIT SYSTEM, TENNESSEE The state of Tennessee has the County Unit System. Each county elects a county court, term, six years. The county court consists of two members from each civil district i Township) and a proportional number from cities. The county court appoints a county school board of five mem - bers; this court also appoints the county superintendent of schools. Kn addition to the county board and county superintendent, appoint what is known as an advisory board. This boar Dsed of one member from each township. This was done as a tication Act", to get away from the small district system and ave a representation from each portion of the county. County intendent Anderson of Nashville, thinks the next legislature liminate the advisory board. Ehe county board, in conjunction with the county superintend - lects all teachers, buys all supplies, makes all repairs for all the s of the county; in fact this board does all the business for all ■hools of the county. Bhis board has the power to eliminate school district boundaries, ish new districts, build new school houses, etc. Bnder this system, they have rural consolidated schools in ssee that are doing most excellent work. ■'he Eastland school, a school of ten grades and nine teachers, rural consolidated school. They have a fine nine room brick ng, well equipped and employ the best teachers available. The pupils come in their own conveyances, no pupil driving </seg>
            <seg id="p480">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT more than four miles; most of the pupils in the district come less than four miles. I spent three-fourths of a day visiting this school. From observation and from conversation with the people there, "The County Unit System" is a decided success in Tennessee. Supt. Anderson has four sub-supervisors; for primary grades, intermediate and grammar grades, agriculture and canning clubs. These super - visors are working in the schools of the county all the time. They report to the county superintendent each day, the conditions as they find them in the different schools. The county superintendent also spends as much of his time as he possibly can visiting schools. The county board and the county superintendent have their offices adjoining; the board has a permanent paid secretary in Davidson and other large counties, but not in smaller counties. The county superintendent recommends teachers and also any changes he deems necessary in any of the schools of the county, to the county board, and they make the changes. Thus the responsibility is removed, in a measure, from the county superintendent to the county board. The County Unit System as I saw it in Tennessee centralizes authority and places back of each teacher the moral and legal support of the county. It makes teachers eligible for any school in the county and renders it possible for assignment to be a matter of merit and promotion. It enables the superintendent to have a uniform term and course of study for all schools, and enables super - visors to do systematic work. EIn all counties of Tennessee, they are making the effort to iblish rural high schools in which agriculture, domestic science, I related subjects shall be emphasized, the elementary schools have 1 to 8 grades, while advanced pupils (9, 10, 11 and 12 grades: Jl attend the most convenient high school, an arrangement that ;ht to ineresae the efficiency of both classes of schools.

            <seg id="p481">NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS I very pupil in normal training classes should be supplied with a of this bulletin and should become familiar with it. He will t helpful as a guide in directing his work and as a means of lation on matters of importance relative to preparation and cer - ion as a teacher. Each teacher who is in any way responsible e normal training work should have a copy of the course of and should know clearly all its provisions. The cases in our experience where normal training students learn at the time of graduation that they have failed to comply with some of the requirements of normal training, and hence are at a disad - vantage in securing their teacher's certificates, come largely from failure on the part of such students to become acquainted at the proper time with the normal training requirements. Often they have been misdirected by their teachers. For this reason, we urge that each normal training student and instructor, at the begin - ning of the year, become at once familiar with all the provisions con - cerned in the normal training course. At the time of the first edition of the course of study, normal training in high schools was in the experimental stage. Considerable space therefore was devoted to discussion of the value of this work and its relation to the teaching force of the state. The experimental stage has passed. The excellent results attained by actual trial of this method of helping to prepare more and better teachers for rural schools attest the wisdom of those who evolved the plan. The hun - dreds of such teachers now doing successful work in our schools are evidence of the fact that normal training in high schools.in Nebraska has helped in a large way to solve the problem of a greater supply of better trained teachers for the rural schools. |.ince the course of study has given such general satisfaction, little change is made in the outline for this edition. The course ended to be suggestive as well as directive. After meeting all ■ed conditions, each superintendent and director in charge will such use of the course of study as is found most helpful with conditions. That the normal training work is meeting with the approval of school men and women, of patrons, and of high school pupils is shown by the large increase in enrollment in classes and the increase in the number of schools giving the work. The work has grown from sixty-nine schools in 1907-8, when the state appropriation was made available, to 176 high schools in 1913-1914. The general expression of satisfaction from county superintendents, school boards and pa - trons with the quality of work done by graduates of normal high schools is our strongest evidence of the wisdom of continuing to ex - tend the work to all communities of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p482">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Pit session of our legislature the value of this work to its bearing upon the development of the highest type through education was fully discussed, after which the was increased from $100,000 to $125,000, thus indicat - of men who give careful attention to the real needs of No other appropriation of an equal amount has done so much for the betterment of the rural school*. The interest in and the enthusiasm for the work so general throughout the state comes from the real test as shown by the results already attained even in the short time that normal training has been operative. Our normal schools, filled to their capacity, are yet unable to supply a sufficient number of teachers for the grades of the city and town schools. This leaves the high school our great - est source of supply for teachers for rural schools. Our rural schools must continue to be supplied with teachers, very largely, by the high schools. Whether trained or not for it, high school graduates begin their work of teaching, almost without exception, in the rural schools. It is this condition which makes the normal training course in high schools of so great importance to the upbuilding of the rural school which has been and will continue to be one of the greatest factors in education in this country. Incidental good results are reported by city superintendents. The large majority agree that: Normal training has improved the discipline in the high school; given higher ideals to the school; helped normal pupils into a better attitude toward their studies, as well as toward discipline; and brought the community into closer and more helpful relation to the schools. Each of these points will appeal at onee to the intelligent patron of our public schools as be - ing very desirable for forming the atmospheie and environment that will be mast helpful in developing true manhood and woman- County superintendents report that the normal trained teachers from high schoolr have very much improved the grade of work done in rural schools. We are at the beginning of a solution of the problem. Teachers for rural schools should not only have a general training for teaching, but should have an operative degree of special training for teaching in rural communities. This provision is being rapidly met by our best high schools in the introduction of courses in agriculture, domestic science, and manual training, which enables a teacher educated in the normal training high school to make an effective application of educational principles and practice in his work in the rural community. The time is near when these courses of study will be a requirement in all institutions training teachers for rural communities. James E. Delzell, State Superintendent. </seg>
            <seg id="p483">REPORT OF INSPECTOR State Superintendent James E. Delzell, Lincoln, Nebraska. I Dear Sir: In compliance with your request, 1 submit the wing report of the Department of Inspection of Normal Training igh Schools for the biennium 1912-1914. ■There are now 176 public schools and six academies giving nor - training. Each of these 182 schools has been personally inspected lg each of the past two years. Khe enrollment of normal trainers for the year 1913-1914 was Most of these were vigorous young people who were appreciat - e opportunity offered them of fitting for rural teaching. I Often these trainers were found in charge of a grade acting as :itutes for regular teachers and they were generally doing good They had previously given careful observation to the methods ie regular teachers and studied the work to be presented for the day in which they were to teach. Superintendents of normal training schools are giving more at - tention than formerly to both observation and practice work by the trainers. County superintendents are much pleased with the better preparation that is evident among the new teachers who come to them from these training schools. More attention than formerly is given to the phases of practical school management and the various problems of the rural school. In many places the county superin - tendent visits all the normal training schools in his county, observes the work of the trainers, gives talks and suggestions along many lines that are practical and helpful for teachers in his county. This is an excellent plan, as it helps materially in co-operation between town and rural schools and gives the county superintendents oppor - tunity of noting the efficiency of different trainers. There has been noticeable improvement in many of the schools during the last two years. Especially is this found in the following items: School boards are not permitting new pupils to enter except at the beginning of school in September, unless there is a kinder - garten under a special teacher, where such children may be cared for. This plan is best for teachers, pupils and patrons. Pupils en - tering after a class is well started are at great disadvantage and are not injured by waiting until the beginning of the next school year. feachers are not asked to teach three grades. This simplifies ■8 very much. Formerly many teachers were asked to care for grades and thus waste their energies trying to look after too different classes. Fifty pupils to a teacher is now the limit and it is seldom that a teacher has charge of that many. Several schools have advanced their standard very much by adding a teacher to the grades so as to </seg>

All the regulations published in normal training bulletin No. 7 are proving to be helpful to normal training pupils, to the work in the grades of normal training schools, and to the rural and village schools where the normal trainers first teach.

SUGGESTIONS TO SUPERINTENDENTS AND TRAINERS Normal Training Do not enter the normal training class to prepare for teaching unless you believe you are worth something to the world. Erhere are now enough high school pupils in the Junior and r classes who do believe in themselves, who have become manly womanly enough to lay aside childish follies, who can separate from play; so that the weak and giddy are not needed for The kind of normal trainer wanted is the one who is full of life and vigor, who enjoys all the best things in life, who can lend a helping hand to any good cause, too broad-minded to do little mean things, too pure to harbor ignoble thoughts, too clean to tolerate personal habits that are unsanitary or obnoxious to others. Et no young man sign the declaration who uses tobacco, or or who is given to profanity, or who has the silly habit of g about places where vile stories are told. Such young men should never seek to become teachers of the young. A young man who indulges in useless or injurious habits such as are offensive to the purest minded, cleanest boys and girls is not fit to teach them. Superintendent* and Trainers Pit is your duty to become familiar with the requirements for the pletion and recognition of normal training. In the following is you will find directions which must be carefully followed both your superintendent and yourself in order to secure credits that </seg>
            <seg id="p485">will enable you to receive a county second grade certificate at the close of your high school course. All records of your four-year high school course must be properly reported. Much responsibility rests on your city superintendent and you should do all in your power to help him keep your record clear. Among other duties your super - tendent must report to the state superintendent each year your at - tendance in the normal class. He must also report to the E University all the grades of your four-year high school course, in all subjects for which you are to receive University credits. Declaration I Sign the declaration which is sent to your school for that pur - . on entering the class. This must be done each year you are in class. Failure to do this forfeits all rights to any grades. Do sign, if you are sure you will not teach. ■The only method of knowing who are members of the trainers' is the signature of the members filed with the state superin - ent.

It is imperative that the pupils sign in duplicate, one signature being in some permanent record book kept by the school. During the coming year the inspector will meet the trainers' classes and discuss the work already covered, the plans followed in observation work and all such details as may in any way lead to a clear know - ledge of the value and progress of the normal training in tfcx spective classes. He will also endeavor to meet some or all of the teachers who are directly concerned in the normal training work. Though county superintendents are usually very busy among their rural schools we trust that each one will visit the trainers' classes in his county early in the year and be able to give helpful criticism when opportunity offers. Class Attendance Attend all the twelve required classes the full time. These classes are, under major reviews: Reading, grammar, arithmetic, geography, each not less than nine weeks; history, pedagogy and agriculture, each not less than eighteen weeks. Classes under minor reviews are: Drawing, mental arithmetic, penmanship, physiology, orthography; four weeks for each of the first four minor reviews, and two weeks for orthography.

            <seg id="p488">Summary From above statements it appears there are three groups of sub jects from which grades are secured for normal training teachers Krst. Normal training special subjects: Major reviews, and pedagogy. Examinations are required in these. gecond. Those studies which are not accredited at the State rsity: minor reviews, and, if not studied in the high school, government, and bookkeeping. Examinations are required in 1 reviews, also in civil government and bookkeeping if not ;d a semester in high school. Third. Subjects that are accredited by the State University and not found in the first group: Algebra, botany, geometry, physics, agriculture, and if taught in the high school, in such a way as to meet the approval of the State University, ci\il government, book - keeping, physiology, and English composition. In these no exam - ination is required if the University grades are accepted by the county superintendent. Change of Rules Kl rules are subject to change, but all county and city superin - ts will receive due notice. Observation I The observation work of trainers should be planned and system - d so that the pupil, the superintendent and the grade teachers I when the observation lessons will be given and who will observe, superintendent should often be present. The work should be dis - &gt;d at some later period. A mere visiting a grade by a trainer will be very helpful. Visiting Rural Schools f)uring the senior year every trainer hereafter must spend at two days in rural schools. Two or more good schools should be ed for this purpose and a full written report of each visit filed the superintendent. These visits, if properly planned and the judiciously spent, will be of much help to trainers. Algebra Two Semesters K Beginning with the school year 1913-14 two semesters of algebra be accepted by the state department as being sufficient for a al trainer. Three semesters are required for all pupils who grad - l prior to September, 1913. Minor Reviews The minor reviews are penmanship, drawing, mental arithmetic </seg>
            <seg id="p489">G. A. GllEGOHY </seg>
            <seg id="p490">The minimum time for the minor reviews is four weeks for each of the first four subjects and two weeks for orthography. Bn case any one of the five minor review subjects is regularly t in the high school, pupils who take the subject in such regular need not take it in a review class, but the superintendent must : the number of weeks taken by each trainer in each of the ninor reviews. I formal trainers may need to omit chemistry, which is no longer ed for University entrance, solid geometry or some other sub - if less importance to them. Normal training is given to help re teachers, primarily to teach in rural schools. It is found they need at least the amount of review indicated in these •ts. Credit for Reviews Two credits are given by the University for a minimum of nine weeks given to each of the major reviews, provided the pupil wishing the two credits shall not take more than three other subjects during the time he is taking a review subject and provided the superin - tendent shall so state in his report to the University for each pupil wishing such The University in granting such credit expects the pupil to put as much time on a review subject as on any other academic work. No University credit is given for minor reviews. Records and Reports Normal training °s contemplated by the state law will not care for itself. There must be some machinery to run a system in which are found one hundred seventy-six schools and over three thousand trainers. The law makes the state superintendent of public instruc - tion the head of this system and he must know in some way the con - dition of the schools, quality of work, type of teachers who come from the schools, type of teachers who are training them and many other items. For this purpose two regular reports are asked from each school. At the close of the first week of school in the fall a report is made which shows the qualifications of the teachers and gives the names of the trainers together with the application for recognition. Near the close of the year the attendance report of the trainers is to be given. Any flaw or failure in either of these reports might cause much trouble to the entire class of trainers. Usually no other written reports are required, but occasionally some data bearing on the work is asked. I So vital to the interests of the trainers are these two regular ■ts that we are asking school boards to consider it a grave error ne whose duty it is to make out the reports to fail to do so. No can make them out except the superintendent or some one of faculty appointed for that purpose, though the secretary of the i must vouch for them.

See page 10 of this bulletin for explanation. Out of over fifty mistakes during the past year affecting normal trainers all but tur were due to superintendents who had omitted something or pied the record incorrectly. Early Reports Both the University inspector of high schools and the inspector of normal training advise that the university reports and the attend - ance report to the state superintendent be mailed to their respective destination at least two weeks before the close of the spring term. By that time the records of the graduating class are sufficiently complete so that the reports may be safely sent. In case of any emergency after the reports are sent, an amended report to cover the emergency can easily be made. It is to be hoped that school boards will hereafter hold the proper member of the faculty responsible for the sending in of these reports. An incentive to prompt action is offered by one school board which pays the superintendent his last month's salary when he produces evidence of the acceptance by the proper parties, of these final reports. Post-Graduates Es'ormal training in our high schools is generally so well done that young teachers of one or more years' experience who did not the normal training course are doing post-graduate work in the il training subjects. This is the proper thing for them to do. any high schools the entire work can be done in one year by UK in both the junior and senior classes. When a post-graduate pupil completes a normal training course, she would be reported in full to the University for the previous four years course and the normal training, just as though she graduated with the class of the current year. If this is not done the pupil would not receive full credit for all work done. Better Work in the Grades Kt is not enough that a normal training school shall be properly ped in the high school department only. Well qualified teachers successful experience should be in charge of every grade. This :essary that the pupils may be well fitted for the high school </seg>
            <seg id="p492">NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS normal training class and that the trainers may have ample oppor - tunity of observing good grade work. The policy of some school boards to elect inferior or inexperienced teachers will soon result in lowering the quality of work done, then in a removal of the normal training from such school. It is very important that trainers should have ample opportunity of learning the best methods of the best teachers in the grades. Reading, arithmetic and language are the three subjects poorest taught in the country. Trainers should be well founded in good methods in these branches. If teachers in grades are not using some consistent method of teaching addition and other fundamental processes in arithmetic, require them taught in the review class. Give opportunity of hearing good language work in the grades. So important is this subject and so effective is the example of the teacher, that no trainer should be continued in the class beyond the eleventh grade, who does not use good language, with good enunciation. It has been said, and perhaps truly, that "the subject most poorly taught in our American schools is English," meaning by this, daily oral English and the written work of every day life. Inspection ■During the school year personal visitation and inspection of the is made by the normal training inspector or one of his assist - who reports to the state superintendent. f luring this visit the credit points already made by each trainer e called for and a note made of the general standing and ability :h one. Those in charge of the training may facilitate this by having the record of each pupil up to date. Overcrowded Rooms No teacher should be expected to take charge of a grade in which over forty pupils are enrolled. Although during the growth of a town it is not always possible to keep down to this number, school boards and superintendents should anticipate as well as pos - sible the needs of the year. Better arrange for thirty to a teacher than to plan for more than forty. Often an emergency is met by renting an outside room and employing an extra teacher. When several grades have a few more than the proper number the problem is solved by taking a few of the best pupils from each grade and placing them with a strong teacher who is paid a better salary than others for doing this harder work. Special for Superintendents Ee years' experience is checking reports of work done by trainers enables the inspector to know in what details superin - i are most likely to make mistakes. Attention is here briefly j some of the most vital requirements. </seg>

Grefory, Normal Training Inspector So many requests have come to the state superintendent for the methods in numbers, published in normal training bulletin No. 5 that the material has been revised and is again presented. Many of the most progressive teachers in the state have adopted these methods and superintendents are advising their use. The addition method as given here is not found in any text book on mathematics and it will not take the place of regular problems in addition. If best results are to be obtained the method should be used from the beginning of teaching numbers. By the methods commonly used, the results secured in teaching primary numbers are very unsatisfactory. Neither skill nor accuracy is secured, although much time is expended. From careful study of the conditions and methods in one hundred sixty of the best schools in Nebraska the conclusion is that the children are permitted to use counters of some sort, blocks, sticks, corn, and squares of pasteboard, until the counting habit is firmly fixed. This habit once formed can not be broken until the child is old enough to be shown the folly of it, and reasonable enough so that his will can be enlisted to fight the enemy of his easy progress in numbers. I Addition is the first number work undertaken. All agree it d be well done as a basis for later work. If it is well done s in a third or fourth grade will read columns of figures easily accurately. In all the hundreds of grades tested not one grade found, from the twelfth down, that could add the following </seg>
            <seg id="p501">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT accurately until after a cure for the evil habit of counting had been carefully used for some weeks: 8679 7*6* 9796 8679 77«x 9«7H 7787 6898 Teachers, try this with all grades, from the fourth to the twelfth, inclusive. Let us hear from any grade that contains ten pupils who add it correctly on the first trial in forty-five seconds, provided such grade has not been cured, in some way, of the counting habit. There are known to be in the public schools many grades that have been cured, and they can meet the test. Pupils who have been properly taught meet this test in the fourth grade, often in the second and third. Superintendents and supervisors who carefully examine the method may care to direct their teachers to this safer and surer path to success. Teachers who are left to their own devices may safely follow the method, for it has been tried and no failures are reported by any teacher who gave it a thorough trial. Method There are forty-five addition facts or combinations of two figures each in addition. Nine of these are such as 1 plus 1, 1 plus 2, 1 plus 3, etc. They need no attention. The remaining thirty-six facts are to be taught as follows: It is desired to develop the fact that 2 plus 3 equals 5. Teacher takes three objects in one hand and two of same kind in the other hand. Let pupils count each group to be sure they are right. Teacher then puts the three and the two together in one group; or teacher may direct pupils to use objects in a similar way on their desks. Help pupils to realize that three and two have been put together. Now let teacher or pupils count the objects in the one group thus made as: one, two, three, four, five. Question them carefully to see that they fully sense the fact that three and two put together makes five. This method does not permit of counting one group of sticks into another group, but discovers the truth without injury to the child. The child now knows that three and two added makes five. At once and many times through the day ask the pupils "How many are three and two?" Also vary the question, as: If Nellie has two apples and Jennie gives her three more, how many will she then have? The object of the frequent drill, requiring three or four seconds at a time, is to fix the fact in the mind of the pupil. In the beginning of teaching number facts one new one every two days is enough. During the day on which a new fact is in- </seg>
            <seg id="p502">NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOi troduced no other number fact should be mentioned in any way, the mind of the child should be free for the one new thing. On the day following the introduction of a new fact, review very much on the new fact and moderately on all that has preceded. Work slowly through the thirty-six combinations in this way, but g&gt; no faster than the pupils can easily and accurately follow. Two facts per week would finish the work in eighteen weeks. That is sooner than necessary. It may not be best to introduce the subtraction facts, three from five leaves two, etc., until half the addition facts art Ell this work is to be done by the teacher drilling the pupils. isy work in numbers at the seats, no placing on the board such as 3 plus 2 equals ? for pupils to work out by counters or any way. The number fact having been once dfveloped, nothing •ill, drill, drill has any place. It should take about one year to master the thirty-fix addition facts, together with the reverse subtraction facts. Generally, little or none of this work should be done during the first year the pupil is in school. Consecutive counting, time on the clock, pages in the book, writing consecutive numbers, and the like, is enough in numbers for the first year. Devote that first year to reading, talking, stories, games, reproductions, making everything bear upon reading or KhoeG who wish at the beginning of school to use this method ring grades that are afflicted with the counting habit may have Ian at once by writing to State Superintendent Delzell for al Training Bulletin No. 7. It is also given in The Nebraska er for September, October and November, 1912. A perfect edge of all the combinations does not enable a pupil to read a n of figures, but it is the first indispensable step. With this ighly in hand the later steps are not difficult.

            <seg id="p503">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT As soon as the 4's in the combination are completed, work like the following should be used on the board: 7 4 3 2 5 6 2 2 4 3 4 3 9 6 7 5 9 9 Teacher points to these combinations and pupils name results rapidly. No time is allowed for pupils to gaze at the combination. The replies are to be given the instant the combination is indicated. If previous drill on combinations has been properly done pupils delight in this rapid work. The above six combinations should be read in four seconds. It is not best to write down the results as above when doing the rapid drill. P\fter the 6's are learned work should be used that involves ing, but use no combinations above the 6's in this work until has mastered more of the advanced tables. In other words, put practice only as fast as thorough advancement is made. Practice exercise in carrying: In using this on the blackboard proceed as lonows: Teacher points to 6, pupils say "6;" then to 7, pupils say "7, 13, set down the 3 and carry the 1." Teacher places 13 in small figures at the top of column and 3 below. Teacher points to 1 at top of column, pupils say "1," points to 7, pupils say "7, 8," points to 4, pupils •ay "4, 12, set down the 2 and carry the 1." Continue in this man - ner either singly or in concert. Leave sums of columns in small figures at the top, through the grades, as a record is thus kept of each separate column. fill work thus far is on the blackboard with the teacher leading, work in numbers has no place in this method until after pupils learned to read columns of figures rapidly and accurately. IVhile the above practice work is in progress, pupils should be very familiar with the two following steps of preparation. Thorough knowledge of the scale from 20 up to 100, so they illy sense or visualize the grouping by tens. If this is properly they can begin anywhere in the scale and write to 100. Second: oral drill as follows: What is the first number up the scale 22 ending with 8? Pupils, "28." Above 37 ending with 5? "45." Above 89 ending with 6? "96," etc. This is for the purpo of developing clear visualization of the number scale. When pupils are well grounded in the preceding steps they are ready for the final step preparatory to addition. They now know 14 » 14 12 i: 6 3 5 4 1 8 5 8 7 f 4 9 4 2c </seg>
            <seg id="p504">NUKMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS that 6 and 7 make 13, but few are impressed with the fact that 13 ends with figure 3. Pupils must not only know and sense this, but they must also know that the sum of 6 and any number ending with Ei a number ending with 3, or 26+7 =33, 86+7 =93. In this show two following facts and drill on them until pupils are instant and urate in their answers. First: That the sum of 7 and any number ending with 9 is always a number ending with 6. Second: That the sum will always be the first number ending with 6 up the scale from the number That is, if 47 is taken, 47 and 9 gives the first 6 up the scale from 47, or 56. In a similar manner drill on many different combinations orally or on the board with pointer as: 22 plus 9 gives a number ending with 1, or 31; 65 plus 8 gives a number ending with 3, or 73. B.fter some of this drill shorten the work to this: Teacher, , pupil, "39"; 47+8, "55"; 59+8, "67", and so on with much y, but always instant response. Give plenty of rapid-fire oral drill of about 30 to 60 seconds many times each day. gf all the preceding work has been thoroughly done under the diate control of the teacher, pupils will be proficient in the fol - g four preparatory steps for addition: First, all the combina - of two figures each; second, the number scale; third, the fact any number plus a single digit gives the same right hand figure e sum as would the unit figure of the same number plus the single digit; fourth, ability to recognise the location in the and name the sum of any number plus a single digit. I With these four steps perfected pupils are ready to begin adding eading columns of figures. In drill on the work that follows ot use any digits from 1 to 4 inclusive during the first few weeks actice. This is to avoid the possibility of counting the numbers her which is apt to be done by some pupils when small digits The work as shown in fig. 1 comes first and is done as follows: Teacher with pointer, points to 8 in units column, pupils say "8," Fig Fijt t M 9 7 8 6 5 8 57 7 a 8 ■a 6 M 9 6 8 I 9 19 8 6 9 7 7 8 » 6 9 6 7 8 9 6 V 8 :{ 6 0 •! 0 3 0 2 3 1 </seg>

Teacher writes 24 in place then points to 4, pupils, "4," teacher points to 6, pupils, "4, 6, 0, 30," teacher writes 30 at top in small figures and 0 at bottom. Teacher points to 3, of the 30, pupils "3," teacher points to 7, pupils "7, 10," teacher writes 10 in position then points to 0, pupils "0, 9, 19," etc. t Do not hurry pupils in the beginning of the drill in fig. 1, but gradually increase in rapidity until a problem like the one given can be added in twenty seconds. After such degree of skill is acquired, the numbers will not be inserted in the columns. The teacher will ask the pupils to tee the numbers, that is, visualize them in place but the teacher will point to the numbers as though they were written in. Fig. 2 shows ap - pearance of this second stage of addition. Column one in fig. 2 would be treated as follows: The teacher points to the numbers as before, "8, 6, 14;" teacher points to place of 4 in 14, just as though the number were written. Pupils "4, 9, 3, 23"; teacher points to place of 3 in 23, pupils "3, 8, 1, 31." Einally, after pupils are reading easily in this way, encourage to make quick mental instead of oral steps, simply naming i. The entire problem in fig. 2 will then be read, "14, 23, 31, down the 1; 10, 18, 24, 33, write down the 3; 9, 17, 25, 32 down the 2; 12, 19, 25, 30, write down the 30." A teacher should not undertake this method with a class until she has worked it over carefully and become proficient in its use. A little time spent by oneself trying it out will bring success. Many teachers have already cured their intermediate and grammar grades ol the habit of counting numbers together by using this method in general exercises. If a cure is attempted it is best to go over the entire plan with the pupil, moving as rapidly as possible but requir - ing accuracy and speed. We have yet to find a single grade in any school in Nebraska from the second grade to the twelfth in which 50 per cent of the pupils knew even the combinations, except such grades as had been cured or had been taught from the beginning by this method or some similar method.

Bt is very important that each quotient figure should be placed ly above its dividend figure. Ey this method it is evident that pupils can scarcely fail to place er in the quotient when it is needed. For division of decimals (lowing rule would do, though not technically worded: I /rite the dividend and divisor as for the Austrian method, an (x) at the right of the divisor, make an x as many places ; right of the decimal point in the dividend as the x&gt; in the r is to the right of the decimal point in the divisor and put a al point at once in the quotient's place directly over the ix&gt; in ividend. Divide as in simple division, treating the numbers as rs.

            <seg id="p507">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Jgure 1 indicates what is done before dividing. The decimal is located, as it should be before the division takes place, als is the new topic for the pupil, he knows division, hence size the decimal point. If the decimal point is placed before lg, it will not be forgotten afterward. Figure 2 shows tho completed. There are three possible cases in division of decimals. Kase 1: In which there is a decimal point in both dividend and ■. Figure 2 illustrates this case. Case 2: In which there is a decimal point in the divisor only. Figure 3 illustrates this case. In this case the decimal point, which may be said to follow every integer, is made visible in the dividend, then to apply the rule it will be found necessary to annex ciphers. Pase 3: In which there is a decimal point in the dividend only. 4 illustrates this case. In this case the rule applies, but since cimal point is not moved in the divisor it must not be moved dividend, therefore, place tbe decimal jtoint directly above the in the dividend.

To the County and City Superintendents, Members of School Boards, Patrons, and Teachers: THE SCHOOL BUILDING I 'here is no doubt but that before the school year of 1914- 1915 in September, if the teacher, school board, patrons and pupils unitedly investigate the conditions of the school building, I grounds, sheds and outhouses on the grounds, a, decided im - ment might be desired for the general appearance and good of chool. A little paint here, a little whitewash there, with a il cleaning up, would increase the interest in the school of community. (he "better schoolhouse," "the better school grounds," and better roads to the schoolhouse" will encourage teachers and to more earnest work in school. Money invested in the edu - of your pupils in better, cleaner and more sanitary home and surroundings tends to give us a more desirable class of citizens generation to generation. BVill you do your part to make YOUR SCHOOL, whether you ounty superintendent, school officer, patron, teacher or pupil, est possible in accordance with the financial conditions in your borhood? Ii'ou must be inspired with a vision of a school house of rustic ic beauty, ventilated, lighted, heated and seated in accordance the best laws of health and comfort — then, and only then, can make your present schoolhouse approach your ideal. The new school buildings of the state should be made thoroughly sanitary in regard to ventilating, lighting, heating and seating. We give in this bulletin illustrations of model one-teacher rural school buildings and floor plans of the same, which may give you some ideas in planning your new schoolhouse or in remodeling your old building. Brhe improvements that have been made in our farm homes and buildings make the box-car schoolhouses erected in earlier days far out of date. The boys and girls should have comfortable ary schoolhouses in which to spend the eight years required for elementary education. I; is well to plan also for a commodious building so that the com - y may use it for literary, scientific, and social improvement. jral school that has occasional literary programs, singing schools, g schools, or old-fashioned school exhibitions, is laying a ition for many happy, profitable hours for the entire school t. The teacher who can take the initiative and inspire pupils </seg>
            <seg id="p515">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT and patrons to meet at least once a month for some intellectual enterprise is a teacher that is worth while. As suggested in several places in this bulletin, it is to your advantage when you erect a school building to make it modern in every respect — ventilating, lighting, heating, and seating. Keep your schoolhouse well painted, and have its walls and ceiling neatly calcimined or papered. Adorn the walls with some well selected pictures. Install a library, consisting of a few well chosen volumes of history, biography, literature, travel and good fiction. The Model Rural School Building; By an Architect The plan as laid out contemplates either an entirely new build - ing, or the ordinary rectangular plan rural school building remodeled, and is designed to embody all of the latest ideas pertaining to light - ing, heating and ventilating.

The upper part of the receptacle which receives this heater curves out- ward at the top so as to deflect the warm air into the room air leaves the heater, being pure and warm, it rises the ceiling to </seg>

This rely eliminates all currents and drafts and holds the temperature he room the same in all parts. To absolutely insure an ascend - current of air in the vent flue at all times there is an iron plate vertically between the heat and vent flue just opposite where the ke pipe enters. The heat from the smoke pipe heats this iron e, which in turn heats the air in the vent flue, causing an upward ent which pulls the air out of the schoolroom as above mentioned. The apparatus as described and laid out is practically fireproof, and much safer than stoves, as there is a double jacket between the fire and the woodwork at any point, and between these jackets is constantly passing a current of air. It would be next to impossible to build a fire intense enough to set the building on fire. While this plant includes all the desirable features of the more elaborate and more expensive plants used in larger buildings, it has the distinct advantage of not being a patented article and can be installed with - out the payment of any royalties whatever, at the same time being practical and economical. Phe fuel room is sufficiently large to hold fuel for at least a week, ng assumed that the janitor or person in charge can fill the at the end of the week and do away with the dust and dirt i by bringing in fuel from the outside many times during the She work room is large and well lighted and heated directly from :hool heater, and is separated from the main schoolroom by a ; partition or sliding door, permitting the same to be thrown he main schoolroom when desired. The closet adjacent is designed for the use of the teacher. The building as designed can be built of either frame or masonry, and if of frame the only masonry required would be the foundation walls and smoke and vent flues.

RURAL SCHOOL LETTER NO. 10 One Day's Work on a Country Schoolhouse It took just one working day of eight hours to transform a Tennessee rural schoolhouse that was in very bad condition into a building of which any community would be proud. What was ac - complished in this instance by community co-operation could be carried out effectively by any county superintendent, teacher or school improvement association. This unique and practical demonstration in public-school im_ provement was engineered by Prof. D. Riley Haworth, of the Eas </seg>

Kband of teachers, school patrons, and normal-school students ied out to the Neil school early in the morning to begin opera- An official photographer was taken along; he made photo - i of the school grounds, the building, and interior at 8 A. M. work began, and again at 4 P. M. when the day's work was eted. The "Before" and "After" pictures made it look as if a e had taken place. The building at 8 A. M. was in as disreputable a condition ma it could be and still be used for school purposes. The workers were armed with shovels, hoes, axes, carpenters' tools, paint, whitewash and soap. They nailed on new boards where they were needed, painted the building, built a chimney, cleaned up the rubbish, scrubbed the floor, renovated the entire interior, constructed a book - cue for the teacher, tinted the walls a pearl-gray color, and hung pictures. The old desks were removed and new desks, supplied by the school district, were placed in the building. The outlay aggregated, in cash, $33. It included 12 gallons of paint, 5 gallons of linseed oil, 4 paint brushes, one-half bushel of whitewash, $2 worth of weather boarding and lathing, 2 pounds of nails, 4 window shades, material for sash curtains, 4 pictures, a number of books to start a school library, and one American flag. When the work was completed the building presented as attractive an appearance as the best one-room country schools. One of the most delightful features of the day was the social enjoyment that resulted from the gathering together of such a large group of workers. At noon a picnic dinner was served by people in the neighborhood of the school. It is planned to repeat the demon - stration in many other parts of the state. THE TEACHER Three elements necessary for a successful teacher are E First, personality that constituent something that is not »• able, but is a part and parcel of the true teacher's resources, that which influences others to action. It is that which iwak - dormant talents. It is that which opens the doorway to a vis - &gt;f usefulness. Second, knowledge of nature, mankind and books. Khird, an inherent desire to point out the way to others that luse them|to make the most of their God-given talents. </seg>

            <seg id="p521">knowledge of nature, mankind and books must be thoroughly understood. Third, the inherent desire of the pupil to know must be given more than ordinary thought. The teacher must be given liberty to use her own methods and plans to reach the desired end in her teaching. The superintendent must be free to guide and direct in a general way so as to be a helper to the teacher. The school teacher that is over-supervised becomes a mere satellite, a phonograph. The whole student body becomes a mere fact depository. And a generation of non-initiative citizens is left to the unsuspecting public.

            <seg id="p522">SCHOOL CALENDAR RECREATION One of the great drawbacks to rural life and rural schools is the isolation and lack of social and recreational life. The teacher can do much to overcome this by interest in and supervision of the play periods at recesses and the noon hour. Senator J. M. Grace says: "Tell the teacher to play with the children at the noon hour; that she should at all times supervise the plays and games; that her influence for good at play time is far greater than during the hours in the schoolroom." We urge the hearty co-operation of teacher and pupil during the play period. The child who learns to "play fair" develops in himself the qualities which tend to self-restraint and obedience to lawful authority, a just consideration of the rights of others, a sympathetic relationship, and the ability to do "team work." Organized play will give the children of the community a common interest, which, if carefully fostered, will gradually lead to other forms of recreation in which the older boys and girls, the fathers and mothers, may later be induced to participate. As the playground is the great developing agency for the children, so the recreation and social gatherings of the patrons will promote their educational, social, and civic activities, and bring happiness and pleasure to the rural communities.

            <seg id="p523">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT SCHOOL AFFAIRS OUT OF POLITICS I "he city, village and rural schools have for years been freed partisan politics. The last legislature eliminated the judges e supreme court from partisan politics. This movement has carried forward to a successful conclusion because the school era and the judges, acting as advisers, helpers and arbiters, have dealing impartially with people of all political beliefs. The following timely editorial by Dr. A. E. Winship is given for the encouragement of taking forever out of politics the manage - ment of our schools in all departments. If a county superintendent is inefficient, no matter what his politics, he should be eliminated and an efficient one selected in his place regardless of political affiliations. If he is efficient, he should be retained, no matter with which political party he is allied. Rescue County Superintendents from Politics E Everyone studying education says that the greatest present need American education is the improvement of rural schools, and every - 1 knows that rural school conditions cannot be greatly improved ere the county superintendent has to play politics. Such public respect for the office that only in very rare cases will a faithful county superintendent be required to waste time, energy and money in a campaign to retain one of the most im - portant public offices in the United States is as high a manifestation of patriotism as can be found in times of peace. P Whoever forces a county superintendent to rob the schools of rt and devotion to their professional needs for months that he f have the salary of the man in office, comes very near being enemy to his country. A political regulation or understanding that a county superin - tendent should serve but two terms — in one state it is a law — is a crime against the children and the country. The country protects a letter carrier, a rural delivery man, and hundreds of thousands of other government and state officers from politics entirely on the ground, for instance, that a letter carrier cannot be efficient in his business if he is thinking about the danger of losing his office. It is impossible for a politican or any rival candidate to shorten a letter carrier's tenure on the ground that he has learned so much of his business that efficient service will be jeopardized- by change, and yet the county superintendent's knowledge of the best interests of the future citizens of the republic is not considered of as much value to the country as a letter carrier's knowledge of the mere residence of men and women. Is there any greater absurdity than such an assumption? E requires four years for a county superintendent to acquaint with the conditions of his work, with local situations, with is of each community, with the teachers, with children, and </seg>
            <seg id="p524">four years in service, and yet, where politics reigns, county superin - tendents are offered as a sacrifice to political traditions. Rhe county superintendent is about the only public school man as no protection from political raiders. EOf course there are states with such noble ideals that this is im - ible and there are some counties in every state in which a virtu - and honorable people make it impossible for political raiders to domineer in such a sacred matter. Is not this a good time for 6 who reverence righteousness and would serve their fellow men to rt themselves? Isn't this as noble an evidence of progressiveness iny that can be demonstrated? Can any public service be greater? Are we willing to continue the degradation of one of the noblest of officials? Every sentiment of patriotism, every impulse of manhood, every BEAUTIFING THE SCHOOL GROUNDS civic propriety, every sense of business sagacity appeals so strongly to men of today that it ought to be easy this year to rescue the office of county superintendent from all taint or suspicion of polit Journal of Education. In Conclusion I Do not hesitate to make your school the best possible in your r. As one has said, "The attempt and not the deed is the idiate power." So to reach the goal, you must put forth a entrated effort if you wish to win. For "Doubts are traitors, make us lose the good we ever might win by fearing to at - t," so attempt to reach your ideal school. "Nay, falter not, our highest good to seek the noblest, — 'tis your only food now you have found it, for the higher vision poisons all meaner </seg>

Everyday Problems in Teaching By M. V. O'Shea, Professor of Education, University of Wisconsin Few persons engaged in school work are known by so many teachers in this country as is Professor O'Shea of the University of Wisconsin. For years he has been lecturing throughout the United States, and has thus had opportunity to come in contact with thousands of teachers and to learn at first hand what their difficulties and problems are. It has been his business for many years to try to solve in the most helpful and sane way the problems of the school - room, and to present his ideas to teachers in a simple, straight - forward, common-sense manner. So well has he succeeded that he is in demand as a speaker on educational topics in all sections of the country. Now, his very best thought and judgment, the product of his years of experience, observation and research, have been presented in the clearest possible manner in his latest book "Everyday Prob - lems in Teaching." So it is possible for every teacher in the country to have every day the expert assistance of Professor O'Shea through this book. A hundred important cities are using it now, ten states (Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina and Texas) have adopted it for their teachers' reading circles, and a score of important normal schools are using it as a text book. </seg>

He is one of the foremost writers and lecturers on educational subjects in America. Doctor Betts, besides having a wide knowledge of and keen insight into the educational problems and progress of today, has ability to tell what he knows in a fascinat - ing and forceful manner. In Better Rural Schools Doctor Betts has given the results of years of first-hand study and investigation of the problem of teaching and managing rural schools. Iounty Supt. Otis B. Hall is well known throughout this country e effective work he has done in the schools of Montgomery !, Indiana. His schools were \isited for an entire week by en state superintendents who desired to see one of the best school systems in the United States. Superintendent Hall has ?d extensively before state and county teachers' associations, regarded as a rural school expert of first rank. Elementary School Standards Vy Frank M. McMurry, Ph. D., professor of elementary educa- Teachers College, Columbia University. I Phis is Dr. McMurry's latest book and he regards it the b«8t he has yet done. Compared with his other works, teachers this book most helpful because of the very specific treatment the concrete application of the standards whereby instruction d be judged. The question of standards of education is vital to every teacher as well as to the superintendent. The superintendent must have an understanding of the right standards in order to formulate a course of study which will produce results; his teachers must understand these standards if they are to work out this course of study according to his ideas. Dr. McMurry rejects the usual examinations as inadequate and unsatisfactory for his purpose. He judges the quality of teaching, course of study, and supervision by the degree to which all three are controlled by purposes of recognized value in daily living. Dr. Hanus of Harvard says of these standards: "They are so funda - mental to satisfactory plans and procedure, and elementary school work that, whatever limitations as to scope and variety they may possess, all good elementary schools must conform to them." g'he author thus defines these standards of value in instruction , properly applied, enable one to judge the school work from the of view of its power to lead to effective and successful life of each individual pupil: 1) Motive on the part of pupils (leading to efficiency The quality of a man's motives determines the quality of his character and vice versa. The work of the school should train pupils to purpose in life. </seg>
            <seg id="p537">P) Consideration of values (relative importance of things). The power to judge of the values and relative importance of things is essential in daily life in order to know where to concentrate time and energy so as to produce the best results. l3) Attention to organization by pupils &lt; system . Orderliness of thought and orderliness of action are closely related and are interdependent. (4) Initiative by pupils (leadership Independent reason and independent thinking lead to inde - pendent action and to leadership.

            <seg id="p560">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Do right and fear not." — Bruce Barne INTRODUCTION EThe State Department has not issued Special Day Programs the use of teachers of Nebraska for several years. Since several ial days have been set aside since the issuance of the last pro - 1, it is advisable that we issue a new edition at this time. The contents of the book are arranged in the order of the special days, the first being "Clean-up Day" in September, with sugg* plans for the work as well as suitable material for a program for the day. Patriotic Day will be observed in October. This seems to be an appropriate time for instilling in the minds of the children interest in true patriotism and a love for the flag and country. Other special patriotic days come after the close of the school in June and before the opening of the school in the fall, when it is not convenient for the school to take charge of the program. Suggestive material, however, is included for some of these occasionr. The Thanksgiving and Christmas programs have suitable ma - terial for excellent exercises for those occasions. The Lincoln and Washington birthday programs are always of interest to the children and patrons. Suitable poems and selections have been printed for use on these days. Kebraska Day, which comes in March, has a very interesting m to all lovers of Nebraska. Sheldon's History of Nebraska ! an excellent reference book for that occasion. Bhe Bird and Arbor Day program for April seeks to inspire in »n a love for the birds, and to encourage them to plant I therwise beautify their surroundings. Mothers' Day, which comes in May, is an occasion in which all, old and young alike, should take an active interest. geace Day in May is a day which should be observed by the b. Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews, Secretary of the American I Peace League, who has taken much interest in this question as been present at the Peace Conference at The Hague, will be d to furnish you with special information for the day if you will her. Address her at 405 Marlborough St., Boston. The Cloring Day exercise is given due prominence, as" it is the only day in the school year that teachers, pupils and patrons may meet and rejoice together over the completion of the work of the year. KFhese programs were arranged and edited by Miss Jennie B is and Miss Anna V. Day. We trust that you will use them and much to the interest of your school, as well as instill into the b of your pupils pride in clean school grounds and schoolhouse, itism, and a love for all that is good.

            <seg id="p563">CLEAN-UP DAY IK picnic on the Friday preceding the opening of school in the to which members of the school board, patrons, teachers, and s are invited, would be an excellent opportunity to clean up the ilhouse, grounds, and outbuildings. Such an occasion would be excellent for promoting the acquaintance of the teacher and ommunity, and would be the starting point for similar meetings ig the year for social and intellectual growth. The old-fashioned schoolhoure in many parts of the state has replaced by a commodious modern building, well equipped, well ventilated, heated and lighted, set in grounds beautified with appropriate trees and shrubbery, with sufficient space devoted to playground purposes. This improvement may become more general by a united effort on the part of the teachers, school officers, county superintendents and state superintendent, each doing his part to raise the efficiency of our schools. There is another interest that is needed to accomplish the greatest good and that is the hearty co-operation of the patrons of the schools. JAMES E. DELZELL. State Stperintendent SCHOOL LAW 6488 Sec. 95. Water closets It shall be the duty of school district boards to provide on every schoolhouse site, and keep in good repair and in clean and healthful condition, at least two separate water closets or privies, located on those portions of the site farthest from the main entrance to the schoolhouse, and as far from each other as the surrounding condition will permit; Provided, where adequate and separate interior closets are provided and maintained in good repair and healthful condition, the foregoing condition of this section shall not apply. Bt would be a good plan to paint outhouses on the inside and sand the paint, the plan that is followed by the railroad com - i in regard to their depots.

            <seg id="p564">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT OPENING CLOSED EYES It was a plain little school building situated at the country cross-roads. The grounds were bleak, bare, and unattractive, devoid of shrub or vine, or tree, to hide their utter nakedness. The un - sightly out-buildings stood out in all their ugliness. The schoolhouse itself was old, weatherworn, and gray. Close at hand was a German farmhouse. Handsome shade trees surrounded the house, in the grassy front yard were clumps of lilacs, and other shrubs, while groups of dark evergreens behind the house shut off unsightly objects and cut off the wintry winds. A border of bright, old-fashioned flowers added a bit of color and gave a touch of home-like beauty. Why couldn't the school home of these country children borrow in imi - tation a share of this simple beauty? Musing on the evident lack of taste in the rural teacher, the visitor approached, indulging, too, in a pessimistic forecast of what he might expect to find inside such a school house. As he opened the outer door, and stood in the entry there came a surprise. In one corner was a low bench with wash-basin and soap, while just above on the wall hung a mirror, a comb-box, and a clean towel. Rows of neatly inserted hooks held the hats and coats and hoods and wraps. Above each separate hook, attached to the wall by brass-head tacks, was a neat card, inscribed with the name of some pupil. The unusual sight and the music of a glad morning song, brought a desire to enter the school-room. A word of courteous greeting and a handclasp of welcome made the visitor feel at home as he took the proffered chair, and turned to look into forty happy A glance around the room brought pleased surprise. The wood - work of seats and walls was as clean as soap could make it. The floor was well swept. The stove with its pipe shone in a coat of polished black, while a neat screen of zinc protected the children near the stove by shielding them from its violent heat. The walls were fresh and sweet from a coat of lightly tinted kalsomine. Around the rear wall and the two sides, just above the black - board, was a border of red cheese-cloth. This border was about ten inches in width, and served as a background for some fifty Perry pictures, arranged according to subject, and placed in groups pleas - ing to the eye. I he windows had plain green curtains, that drew down from the Over the lower sashes were neat curtains sliding on horizontal These curtains of dainty muslin softened the glaring light, they gave an air of cosy comfort to the room. It was a simple story, how this plain little dingy room had been transformed into a place of delight. The teacher first donated a Longfellow picture, and encouraged a free donation of pennies to purchase Perry pictures. Enough was soon raised to buy fifty of these picture*, and the cheese-cloth to serve as back-ground. Each </seg>
            <seg id="p565">child had a voice in helping to select fifty from a lot sent on ap - proval, as every pupil had given his mite. An earnest appeal to the board from pupils and teacher secured a coat of kalsomine and promptly brought a neat bookcase. A Saturday morning "bee" ac - complished the house-cleaning. Irhe children gathered about the visitor at recess time to tell each one gave at least a penny and how all did some work in &gt;ing to make our school-room so pretty." A big boy volunteered nformation that teacher and pupils were already planning a g campaign "to make the grounds just as pretty as they can Wisconsin Arbor and Bird Day Annual IS YOUR SCHOOL-HOUSE ATTRACTIVE? This is a personal question to each teacher. Is the schoolhouse in which you are teaching attractive in appearance? Are the school grounds attractive? If not, what have you done to make them at - tractive? It will not do for us to sit around and wait for someone else to do it, for that policy will not improve the conditions. On the other hand, if you have done what you could each year to make the schoolhouse and the school grounds more attractive, you have left your mark on the scnool, in the minds and hearts of the pupils, and upon the homes which they will help to make later on. Let us all pull together, each doing his own part in his own school, until this splendid state becomes noted for the attractive school grounds and buildings which it provides for its children. This is not an argument for expensive buildings and grounds. Not that by any means! We desire to teach simplicity and not extravagance: for beauty in school houses and on school grounds can be attained by simplicity and not by extravagance. A DEFINITE PLAN If your school grounds are very unsightly, with fences half down, no walks, ashes scattered all around, and no trees planted: if the building needs painting, and there is so much to do that you hardly know where to begin, do not be discouraged. Look the situa - tion over carefully and formulate a definite plan. Do not attempt to do it all at one time. Get the school board to do at least one thing each year towards the improvement. Then decide upon some certain alteration which you and the pupils can carry out. The next year do a little more. For instance, suppose you get the school board to paint the schoolhouse this year. Next year ask them for a new walk or new outhouses. This year suppose you get the pupils to level the yard and sow grass seed, putting on some manure if necessary. Plant a tree on Arbor Day. Next year plant some shrubs, some vines to grow over your out-houses to shield them, and keep the lawn in </seg>

Another year keep all this in shape and do a little more four years of constant, definite work will transform a school Your pupils will be glad to help and will become proud of dI. SOME PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS e While the improvement of the interior of the building is just important as the improvement of the exterior, and should go d in hand with it, yet the purpose of this article confines us to onsideration of the latter. It is hoped that the teachers &gt;f the e will not pass the following suggestions over with a mere reading them. On the contrary, it is hoped that each teacher will act n as many of them as possible and that not one year will pass hout each school being improved in appearance. gn the first place, each school should have plenty of land for a in front and ample playgrounds in the rear. There is a consoli - school in Illinois that has twenty-four acres surrounding the I building. It is divided into lawn in the front and part way along the sides, and splendid playgrounds in the rear. Here is room enough for the little children to play without the in - snce of the older ones. The children of the country need to be t to play and the school yard is the place for it. Now then if school is located on a patch of land about as big as the palm of your hand, see if you cannot get the grounds enlarged. Get two acres or more. If the yard is uneven, full of bumps and holes, level it off to a good even surface which slopes slightly away from the building. It may be necessary to plow up the yard and harrow it to accom - plish this. Have a "frolic" some Saturday and get this done. If you are enthusiastic you will be able to get several of the men of the community to help you. This is being done in many places this There should be wide, clean-cut walks leading from the road to the door of the school house and from the door around to the outhouses. Concrete walks are the best and most enduring. How - ever, should it be impossible to have concrete walks put on gravel. Make the walk rounding so as to shed water. Keep it frep from weeds and grass. The out-buildings of many school grounds are eye sores. Thi s is not necessary, for when properly screened by latticework or fences covered with vines, and further concealed with a few shrubs planted in a group, they are barely noticeable. Teachers should consult the School Laws to see that the out-buildings come up to the requir&lt;;- ■)o not plant any trees or shrubs out in the center of the lawn, i a large open space in the center and plant the shrubs and along' the edges and in the corner. The idea should be to have </seg>
            <seg id="p567">PECIAL DAY PROGRAMS a large open lawn with shrubs on the borders as just suggested Plant a row of trees along the walk or street and along the other walks. Other suitable places would be along the boundaries of the school plot as along the fences. A group of trees in the rear of the yard forms a very pretty background, particularly when edged with shrubs. If the school house is in an exposed position, a row of tree »r a double row of mass planting of trees should be planted on the windward side to cut off the cold win tie of these should be deciduous trees and some should be evergreen trees. Do not place too close to the building as they shut off the light hrubs make a much better appearance if planted in group; They should be planted in the corners, along the base of the build- ing, and along the fence. Do not plant them in straight rows, but with an undulating or waving edge to the mass. Be sure to plant a few or a group that will, at least, partly conceal the out-houses. Have the pupils do as much of the work as they can with your help. This is practical education. You will be greath I at the enthusiasm you can stir up. Plant your trees and shrubs on Arbor Day, having the pupils do the planting under your direction. Previous to Arbor Day have pupils prepare the ground for planting the shrubs There will be some who will be unable to carry out many of these suggestions, owing to the fact that the location of the school building is such that it can never be made attractive. In this case the thing to do is to work up public sentiment in favor of a new location, and if need be, a new schoolhouse. It is ethically wrong. to house children in a schoolhouse that cannot be made attractive. Remember the school must lead the way. Do not be discouraged if your plans for an attractive building are not accepted at once. It takes time to mold public sentiment.

Jingle, jangle, jangle, jingle, Till I wish that I was single. BEAUTIFYING RURAL SCHOOL GROUNDS Khe country school yard is often a dreary place. The plain building of the rural school, too frequently little better in •ance than a cattle shed, stands in the middle of its bare yard like a scarecrow in a cornfield after the corn has been gathered. And like the scarecrow in his deserted field, the picture is well fitted to frighten children. ■here is no bit of ground where beauty is more appropriate, it will extend a wider and more constant blessing, and where tore easily obtained. I There are ferns for shady corners; there are many varieties of goldenrod that, bending in September breezes, will beckon the ren back to school as to a golden way to knowledge; there are itities of sumac which, put in clumps against the building or high back fence, will change an ugly barrier into a gorgeous ■n; there are vines that ask only for a chance to climb lovingly over the doors and windows; there are little trees only waiting for an opportunity to spread their roots in the school yard and grow great there, entering tirelessly into the games of a ceaseless pro - cession of scampering children, receiving into their arms the boys and accepting the confidences of the whispering girls and making for all when the sun is high a beautiful welcome shade. There are violets and snowdrops that are eager to play hide and seek in the school yard early spring days, and in some parts of the state there are wild roses to bloom in June and lend their sweetness for all the summer to the memory of school. ■ince we can so easily make the school yard beautiful, a little in the lives of ourselves and of those who are to follow us, and it is fun to do it — going out into the woods and the fields for </seg>

After the last verse, the trio should work into the center of the stage and form a picture pose, the tallest kneeling and the other two, one on each side, posing over her, the flags held well up at the back. As the trio take their pose all the others move forward a little, still keeping the half circle.

Rustle the wild, long grasses there, And through the chambers vast awake The echoes of his parting prayer, Who died for freedom's sake. Take roses in both hands and strew The graves of those to honor known; But, oh! one tender thought is due To him who died alone. Alone with none but God to see The young brave soul his bondage break: And yet he fought for liberty, And died for freedom's sake. Amelia Barr On Beautiful May Mornings On beautiful May mornings I often watch and wait Where lilies of the valley grow beside the garden gate: For when the white flowers open in fragrance and in grace. A lovely garland I shall make for my soldier's resting place. When I lay a wreath upon his grave on Decoration Day, I shall dream of the bright May morning when the soldiers marched away. ■1 to all they loved so dearly they said a sad good-bye, think how grand a thing it was for their native land to die. Mary F. Butt*. God give us men! A time like this demands Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands; Men whom the lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honor; men who will not lie; Men who can stand before a demagogue And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking; Tall men, sun crowned, who live above the fog In public duty and in private thinking. For while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds Their large professions and their little deeds, Mingle in selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps, Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps. — J.

The wind is cutting and bold. From each lowly hut and cottage Unto the house of prayer, With rifles upon their shoulders The pilgrims assemble there. The dark, dreary winter is ended. The spring with its soft, gentle rain. And the warm sunny days of the summer Had ripened the much needed grain. Now each garner is bursting with plenty. Each heart, too, is filled with great joy. This winter no famine will haunt them, No terror their thoughts will employ. In the bleak little church in the village Are gathered stern men and fair maids, Their praises are joyfully ringing And echo o'er high hills and glades. Thus passed the first day of Thanksgiving, With thanks that e'er came from the heart And no matter how humble his station Each person in them took his part. American History Stories </seg>

It was formerly the custom to have some one impersonate Santa Claus and distribute gifts to the children in per - son. Gradually this custom died out, and the presents were left for them, generally at the hearthstone. As the giver was no longer seen by the children some explanation was necessary, and the little ones were told that Santa Claus came down the chimney, left their presents, and departed the same way. Undoubtedly the poem, "'Twas the Night Before Christmas," published in the United States in the early days of the nineteenth century, spread the myth enorm - ously in English-speaking countries.

Phillips Brooks QUAINT RUSSIAN CUSTOMS At Christmas time in the Russian provinces, as at Hallowe'en in in other countries, popular superstition holds that it is very easy to read the future. The girls read the future by breaking eggs in a glass of water and deducing their fate from the shape it takes, first leaving it before the shrine of some saint, or by pouring melted wax into cold water. The final test of fate is to put a ring of each guest into a large pan, covered with a cloth, being careful to place three bits of charcoal and small pieces of bread and salt at the psychic angles of the pan. The rings are all turned with a spoon while the girls sing songs. At the end of each song a ring is pulled out and the song that has been sung is known to fortell the future of the owner of the ring.

            <seg id="p628">LINCOLN DAY February twelfth ABRAHAM LINCOLN AT GETTYSBURG, PA., NOVEMBER 15, 1863 Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here; but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the un - finished work for which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take in - creased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families second families, perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a family of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside in Adams, and others in Macon county, Illinois. My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, emigrated from Rockingham </seg>
            <seg id="p629">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT county, Virginia, to Kentucky about 1781 or 1782, where a year or two later he was killed by the Indians, not in a battle, but by stealth, when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest. His ancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks county, Pennsylvania. An effort to identify them with the New England family of the same name ended in nothing more definite than a tilarity of Christian names in both families, such as Enoch, Levi, rdecai, Solomon, Abraham, and the like. My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age, and he grew up literally without education. He removed from Kentucky to what is now Spencer county, Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home about the time the State came into the Union. It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals, still in the woods. There I grew up. There were some schools, so called, but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond "readin 1 , writin', and cipherin' " to the rule of three. If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened to sojurn in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education. Of course, when I came of age I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to the rule of three, but that was all. I have not been to school since. The little advance I now have upon this store of education I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity. Kwas raised to farm work, which I continued till I was twenty- At twenty-one I came to Illinois, Macon county. Then I got w Salem, at that time in Sangamon, now in Menard county. I remained a year as a sort of clerk in a store. Then came the Black Hawk war; and I was elected a captain of volunteers, a success which gave me more pleasure than any I have had since. I went through the campaign, was elected, ran for the Legislature the same year (1832), and was beaten — the only time I ever have been beaten by the people. The next and three succeeding biennial elections I was elected to the Legislature. I was not a candidate afterward. During this legislative period I had studied law, and removed to Springfield to practice it. In 1846 I was once elected to the lower House of Congress. Was not a candidate for re-election. From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive, practiced law more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in politics; and gen - erally on the Whig electoral tickets, making active canvasses. I was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri Com - promise aroused me again. What I have done since then is pretty well known. Eany personal description of me is thought desirable it may be am, in height six feet four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, ng on an average one hundred and eighty pounds; dark sxion, with coarse black hair and gray eyes.

After answering questions upon every detail of that great crucial battle, General Sickles asked: "Mr. Lincoln, what did you think of Gettysburg? Were you much concerned about it?" Lincoln replied, "I thought very little about Gettysburg, and I had no concern about it." ■Fhe General expressed great surprise, and said that he had rstood that the capital was in a great panic, and asked why the dent was so free from concern. </seg>

Upon its rity, the colored man failed to pay. Instead of serving the customary notice of protest upon the en - dorser, the cashier took the note in person to Mr. Lincoln, who at once offered to pay it. Kr.

It is related that a gentleman from a Northern city entered Mr. Lincoln's private office in the spring of 1862, and earnestly requested a pass to Richmond. "A pass to Richmond!" exlaimed the President. "Why, my dear sir, if I should give you one it would do you no good. You may think it very strang'e, but there's a lot of fellows between here and Richmond who either can't read or are prejudiced against every man who totes a pass from me.

" Judge Baldwin, an old and highly respectable gentleman, so - licited a pass outside the Union lines to see a brother in Virginia, but being refused, finally obtained an interview with Lincoln and stated his case. "Have you applied to General Halleck?" inquired the President. "And met with a flat refusal," said Judge B. "Then you must see Stanton," continued the President. "I have, and with the same result," was the reply. "Well, then," said the President with a smile of good humor, "I can do nothing, for you must know that I have very little influence with this administration!" B&gt;ne day, a particularly persevering officer-seeker called on Mr. In, and, presuming on the activity he had shown in behalf of arty ticket, asserted as a reason why the office should be given that he made Mr. Lincoln President. BYou made me President, did you?" asked Mr. Lincoln, with a e in his eye. "I think I did," said the applicant. "Then a pretty mess you've got me into, that's all!" replied the President, and closed the discussion. In a speech during the campaign for his re-election, Mr. Lincoln spoke as follows: "I have not permitted myself, gentleman, to con - clude that I am the best man in the country (for President); but I am reminded in this connection of a story of an old Dutch farmer who remarked to a companion once that 'it was not best to swap horses while crossing a stream.' " One of the numerous paymasters at Washington sought an intro - duction to Mr. Lincoln. He arrived at the White House quite opportunely, and was introduced to the President by the United States Marshal with his blandest smile. While shaking hands with the President, the paymaster remarked, "I have no official business with you, Mr. President; I only called to pay my compliments," "I understand," replied "Honest Abe;" "and from the complaints of the soldiers, I think that is all you do pay." </seg>

The t was the war, with its battles and sieges, its victories and defeats, sufferings and tears. Just as the curtain was lifting on the second final act, the restoration of peace and liberty, the evil spirit of rebellion, in the fury of descair, nerved and directed the hand in assassin to strike down the chief character in both. It was no n who killed Abraham Lincoln; it was the embodied spirit of ison and slavery, inspired with fearful and despairing hate, that ick him down in the moment of the nation's supremest joy </seg>
            <seg id="p638">Sir, there are times in the history of men and nations when they stand so near the veil that separates the mortals from the immortals, time from eternity, and men from God that they can almost hear the beatings and pulsations of the heart of the Infinite. Through such a time has this nation passed. RWhen two hundred and fifty thousand brave spirits passed from leld of honor, through that thin veil, to the presence of God, when at last its parting folds admitted the martyred President le company of those dead heroes of the Republic, the nation stood so near the veil that the whispers of God were heard by the children of men. Awe-stricken by his voice, the American people knelt in tearful reverence and made a solemn covenant with him and with each other that this nation should be saved from its enemies, that all its glories should be restored, and, on the ruins of slavery and treason, the temples of freedom and justice should be built, and should survive forever. It remains for us, consecrated by that great event and under a covenant with God, to keep that faith, to go forward in the great work until it shall be completed. Following the lead of that great man, and obeying the high behests of God, let us remember that: Ee has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat: e is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; h, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! Our God is marching on. James A. Gar field LINCOLN'S RELIGION Lincoln's religion was peculiarly hu own. He did not belong to any church but he had ■ Arm faith and belief in Cod. In the campaign of I860, he was greatly pained by the canvaaa of the voters in Springfield which showed that of the twenty clergymen in the city all but three war* against him. In speaking of this to Hon.

If He has a ind work for me, and I think He has, I believe I am ready. nothing, but truth is everything.

"The fame of the hero ne'er slumbers." The world's monument stands the Potomac beside, And what says the shaft to the river?

Oldest Settlements On the site of the Council Bluffs, where Lewis and Clark held council with the Indians, stood old Fort Atkinson, built in 1819, the first United States fort in Nebraska. In 1827 the fort was abandoned and the traders and hunters went to Bellevue. No one knows just when the first white men settled in Bellevue, but the fur trading records make mention of it in Bellevue still stands on the banks of the Platte and Missouri and is the oldest town in Nebraska. Old Fort Kearney was built in 1847 at Nebraska City. The next year its name was taken away and given to a new fort two hundred miles west in the Platte valley. The new Fort Kearney was the only fort between the Missouri river and the Rocky moun - tains in the early years, and was the place where other roads united with the Oregon trail. Fort Kearney has fallen into ruins, and the present city of Kearney is five miles distant. In 1854 Nebraska City had but one house. Omaha was started in 1854 by men from Council Bluffs, who built a two story brick building and offered it for a capitol. The building of Brownville began in 1855.

Wattles, President of the Nebraska State Com - mission to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, i Nebraska celebrates this year the centennial of the first explora - tion by Americans and the semi-centennial of its organiaztion as a territory of the United States. It was on the 15th day of July, 1804, that Meriwether Lewis and Captain George A. Clark, with their intrepid band of explorers, under commission of President Thomas Jefferson, reached the fortieth parallel of latitude on their perilous voyage up the Missouri. From this parallel, which marks the southern boundary of the state, to the forty-third parallel on the northern boundary consumed a period of fifty-six days, and many places of their encampments on the western banks of the Missouri have been found and marked in later years. Near the mouth of the Platte river a stop of six days was made, and two daring hunters were sent out to find and invite the Indians, who were known to inhabit this region, to a council. Near the mouth of the Elkhorn river an Otoe village was discovered, but all of the inhabitants were away on the chase for game. After a further search, a small band of Otoe and Missouri Indians was found near the present site of Fremont, and they, with others of their tribe, finally met the explor - ing party on the third day of August near the present site of Cal - houn, where presents were exchanged and the Indians were informed of the change of government over the great Louisiana Territory. The air-gun on one of the boats was fired, and after many expres - sions of good will the voyage was continued. Near the Black Bird Creek bands of Omaha Indians were found, and trinkets were ex - changed with them for corn, which grew then as now in abundance in the river bottoms. In the records of this memorable exploration, special mention is made of the rich rolling lands well adapted for settlers, then the pasture ground for buffalo, elk, deer and other wild game. Then the Otoe, the Pawnee, the Omaha and the Sioux Indians hunted over the prairies of Nebraska and fought their battles for supremacy as their ancestors had done for centuries be - fore. No white man disturbed their aboriginal dreams, and no signs of civilization were to be found. </seg>
            <seg id="p656">SPECIAL DAY PROGRAMS Fifty years passed with scarcely any change. Steam had been applied to navigation, and the boats of the American Fur Company were making regular voyages up the Missouri. Trade relations with the Indians had been established. Furs were their only products, and these were exchanged for blankets and baubles. A few adven - turous whites had settled along the western banks of the river, and the landing-places of the steamboats had taken the names of towns. In 1854, when by act of Congress Nebraska was admitted as a terri - tory, although its boundaries included the present state and all of the Dakotas and a part of Montana. Wyoming and Colorado, its white population was less than 1,000. But with its admission was coupled the admission of Kansas and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, which precipitated the agitation of the slavery question throughout the South and East, and brought to this territory its first immigration. Francis H. Burt, who had been appointed Gover - nor, died a few days after reaching the territory, and on October 18, 1854, Thomas B. Cuming, then Secretary of the territory, by virtue of his office, assumed the duties and became the first acting governor of the territory of Nebraska. No ceremonies of pomp and pagentry marked the event. No bands of music or acclaim of populace hailed the new ruler, whose advent gave birth to a new commonwealth. In simplicity of form, and yet with a strength of character seldom seen in men, this young ruler began his arduous duties and by his wisdom and courage laid the foundations on which has been built a great state. The capital was first located at Omaha, and here, on January 16, 1855, the first legislature convened. Among those prominent in the affairs of the territory at that time were Dr. George L. Miller, A. J. Hanscom, A. J. Poppleton, J. Sterling Morton and Judge E. Wakeley, whose names have since become household words in Nebraska. At first the pioneers made homes on the free government lands along the eastern rivers, and until the advent of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1865, the interior of the state made little progress. The completion of that railroad in 1869, gave a great impetus to settle - ment along the rich valley of the Platte, and soon other railroads were built and attracted settlers by the thousand. They came from eastern states and from foreign countries. They came without means and endured such hardships as only pioneers can know. The loneli - ness of the prairies experienced by wives and mothers, who left eastern homes and friends and lived during those early years in the sod houses of the homesteader, far removed from neighbors, could only be endured by those of Spartan mould. I tut like the changing scenes of the kaleidoscope, those prairies made to bloom and bear their rich harvests of grain and fruit, sod houses were replaced by modern dwellings, schools and hes were built, towns and cities sprung up as by magic, counties organized and civil government established. Nebraska is now hird state in the Union in the manufacture of meat products. </seg>

MAKING AND NAMING NEBRASKA (Prom Sheldon's History and Stories of Nebraska FThe Name of Nebraska — Nebraska had no name for many re. To the early fur traders it was either the "Missouri country" the " Platte country," stretching westward to the head waters of the Platte in the Rocky mountains. It was the land of the Omaha, Em, Ponca, Pawnee, and Sioux Indians, for these were the tribes tg the Missouri and Platte rivers whom the fur traders met and &gt;i whom they traded. The most common way of describing this on a hundred years ago was as "The Council Bluffs," by which le the fur traders meant the shores of the Missouri above the ith of the Platte. A little later, when the first emigrants to gon and the pioneers to the Rocky mountains began to cross this ntry, it was "The Great Buffalo Plains," for the animal most 1 and most sought for, by both Indians and white men, gave its le to the country. It was also called "the Great American «rt" and is so named on some of the early maps. Fifty years were needed for the making and naming of Ne- Nebraska and Oregon. — In these early days the United States claimed all of the Oregon country westward across the Rocky moun - tains from Nebraska to the Pacific Ocean. England claimed it, too, as did also Spain and Russia. The English Hudson's Bay Company, in order to get the Indian fur trade, had built forts in the Rocky mountains and upon the Pacific coast. These English forts and fur traders tried to keep out the American settlers. This made danger of war between England and the United States. The United States had only a few pioneer settlers in Oregon. Between these and the Mississippi valley lay the Rocky mountains and the great Indian country where no white people lived. To protect and help the Americans who wanted to make Oregon their home, a plan was made at Washington to open the Indian country west of the Missouri and to bring in settlers who would raise crops to feed the soldiers and </seg>
            <seg id="p660">the emigrants on their way to Uregon. 1 o prepare the way. Lieu - tenant John C. Fremont was sent in 1842 by the United States to explore the plains and the Rocky mountains. Now, for the first time the name "Nebraska" appears. Fremont's account speaks of the "Nebraska River." The secretary of war, William Wilkii his report of November 30, 1844, says, "The Platte or Nebraska river being the central stream would very properly furnish a name to the territory. Troops and supplies from the projected Nebraska territory would be able to contend for Oregon with any force com - ing from the sea." "Nebrathka," meaning the "flat water," was the Otoe Indian name for the Platte. The First Nebraska Bill The first bill to make a land called Nebraska was introduced in Congress on December 17, 1844. This first Nebraska included the states of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and parts of Wyoming, Colorado and Mon - tana. For the next ten years there was a great struggle in Congress over the making of Nebraska territory. Stephen A. Douglas, of Illinois, was the champion of the Nebraska idea. Many obstacles were in the way. The Nebraska-Kansas Bill— This first Nebraska bill failed to pass. In 1848, Senator Douglas introduced a second bill. This also failed. In 1853 a third bill was defeated. In 1854 a fourth Nebraska bill came up in Congress. It was called the "Nebraska- Kansas Bill" and made two new territories out of the Indian country. It also provided that the settlers in each territory should say by their votes whether it should be slave or free. This made a fierce fight over the Nebraska-Kansas bill. The South said that Nebraska and Kansas belonged to the w.hole country, that all the people should be allowed to go there and take their property with them and that the settler from the South had the same right to take his slaves there, that the settler from the North had to take his horses and cattle. The North said that Nebraska and Kansas had been made free by the Missouri Compromise, that slavery was wrong and that there should be no more slave territory, but that both South and North should keep their agreement made in 1820 and make the West a home for free men and women and not for slaves. All the country was ablaze with excitement over Nebraska and Kansas. I The South and North (Quarrel Over Nebraska The old ies — Whig and Democratic -were broken up over this question, churches were broken into the northern and southern factions, months nothing was talked of but the Nebraska-Kansas bill. Feeling 1 more and more bitter, and it began to appear that there might *ar between the South and the North. Finally, after an all t's contest in Congress the Douglas Bill, creating the two new tories of Nebraska and Kansas, was passed and signed by Presi- Pierce on May 30, 1854. Thus was Nebraska named and made into a territory. </seg>
            <seg id="p661">» STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT THE FIRST HOMESTEAD From Shddon'i History and Stories of Nebraska The first free homestead in the United States was taken by Daniel Freeman on Cub Creek in Gage county, Nebraska, about five miles northwest of Beatrice. Daniel Freeman was born in Ohio in 1826, and moved with his parents to Illinois in 1835. He was in - tensely interested in the free homestead bill from the time it was first introduced in Congress. Year after year he watched its progress and hoped for its passage and many times said that he wished to be the first man to take a homestead. When the free homestead bill was signed Daniel Freeman was a soldier in the Union army. A few months later he was given a brief furlough and came to Nebraska to look over the beautiful country, then lying vacant, for a home. He found the place that suited him and started for the nearest United States land office, which was then at Brownville. Nebraska, arriving there December 31, 1862. The little town was thronged with settlers who had come there to take land. That night there was a New Year's Eve party at the hotel, which was attended by all. The new homestead act was to go into effect the next day but as New Year's was a holiday the land office would not be open until January 2. Mr. Freeman was under orders to join his regiment and expected to leave the next day. He told his story and his great desire to be the first homesteader in the United States. All the others agreed that he should have the first chance and with him persuaded a clerk in the land office to open the office a few min - utes after midnight on January 1st for Daniel Freeman alone. Thus it came that Daniel Freeman made homestead entry No. 1, and afterwards received homestead patent No. 1 for 160 acres on Cub Creek near Beatrice. Thus Nebraska has the honor of having the first homestead in the United States. Since that time over 1,000,000 homesteaders have followed Daniel Freeman's example, receiving over 120,000,000 acres of land as a free gift from our government. Of these homesteaders over 100,000 have lived in Nebraska. Nothing has helped so much in the settlement of the West as its free lands. One of the songs sung everywhere after the passage of the homestead act had for its refrain these words: Come along, come along, make no delay, Come from every nation, come from every way, Our lands they are broad enough, have no alarm For Uncle Sam is rich enough to give us all a farm." B Daniel Freeman served his country in the Union army until close of the Civil War, in 1865. Then he brought his bride and ed on his Nebraska homestead. Here their seven children grew lanhood and womanhood and here Mrs. Freeman lives with her Iren and grand-children. Mr. Freeman died December 30, 1908. This first homestead is a </seg>

The old log cabin with sod roof, which was the first home of the Freeman family, has long since disappeared. There is a brick house and orchard, and an old freighting road, from the Missouri river to the mountains runs for nearly a mile through the place, with rows of giant cottonwoods planted by Mr. Freeman on either side. On the hill at one corner of the farm, overlooking the valley and the freighting road, is the grave of Daniel Freeman. It is proposed that the United States shall purchase his first homestead from the Free - man family and make it a public park to commemorate what is regarded as the most important law passed by the United States and the place where that law was first applied.

He and the • first officers of Nebraska were appointed by President Pierce were paid by the United States. He was a slender, handsome who loved books and was not used to frontier life. The long journey from his home, part of it by stage and steam - boat, brought him worn out to Nebraska City. Nebraska City had </seg>

He grew worse and died on October 18. His body was taken back to the old home in South Carolina. There was great sorrow in the little village of Bellevue over the death of the first governor, for all who met him learned to love him. Kcting Governor Cuming — The secretary of state, Thos. B. ng of Michigan, became acting governor. He was very different nd and person from Governor Burt. His eyes were dark, his traight and black, his mind bold and shrewd. Eild Bellevue — Bellevue was the oldest town in Nebraska, for Atkinson had been abandoned. It was in fact the only town, was the old fur trading post. Here the Indian agent having p of the Nebraska Indians lived. Here the first Christian maries came and built the only mission house then in Ne - a. It was expected that Bellevue would be the capital of iska. Eew Omaha — Eight miles above Bellevue, in the woods fronting issouri river, men from Council Bluffs, Iowa, had started a vhich they named Omaha. There they had built a two-story building which they offered to give for a capitol. Acting - or Cuming called our first legislature to meet there on Jan - 6, 1855. Nebraska a* a Territory I Very bitter were the quarrels which followed this act. The first is of white settlers taken by order of the acting-governor showed ! people. It was claimed that many persons counted did not in Nebraska at all, but that some came over from Iowa, voted went back and did not settle in Nebraska. The First Legislature — The first Nebraska legislature was the only part of the government elected by the settlers. It had a council of thirteen members and a house of representatives of twenty-six members. Twenty-one members came from the North Platte and eighteen from the South Platte. By the count of the first census there were nearly twice as many settlers in the South Platte region as in the North Platte. I Phe Dividing Platte — The Platte river cut the scattered merits of early Nebraska sharply into two parts. The people too poor to build bridges, the river was too wide and shallow ?rries and its sandy bottom was too soft to make good fords, fight between the North and South sections began at the first n of the legislature and continued through the years.

The census, ;tober of that year found 4,494 of whom 1,549 were in the North e section, 2,945 in the South Platte section. Nebraska City become the largest town in the territory, the leader of the South e section and the chief rival of Omaha. The Effort to Move the Capital to Salt Creek The third Nebraska legislature met on January 5, 1857. It is noted for two It passed a bill to move the capital from Omaha to Douglas in Lancaster county by a vote of nine to four in the council, and twenty-three to twelve in the house. Douglas was a "paper town," somewhere near Salt Creek, no one knew just where, as no one lived there. As Governor Izard vetoed the bill, Douglas never started to grow and no one knows to this day where the capital would be if it had been moved from Omaha in 1857. The War Between North and Soi th Platte The fourth legislature which met in Omaha, December 8, 1857, is known as that of the "Florence Secession." The war between the North Platte and South Platte sections had become fierce and bitter. There were twice as many settlers in the South Platte country as in the North. A majority of both houses of the legislature were from the South Platte. The North Platte by Governor Izard's veto had been able to hold the capital at Omaha. The South Platte was determined to take it across the river. A bill for that purpose was introduced. A fist fight on the floor followed between members from Omaha and members from the South Platte. The next day, January 8, 1858, a majority of both houses and council adjourned to the town of Florence, six miles above Omaha. There they met and passed laws, while the other members met in Omaha. Among the acts passed at Florence was the one providing for the removal of the capital to Neapolis. This was another paper town on the south bank of the Platte, near where Cedar Bluffs, Saunders County, is located. Governor Richardson Comes to Nebraska- Nebraska's third governor, William A. Richardson, of Illinois, arrived in Omaha, January 12, 1858, in the midst of the Florence secession. He re - fused to recognize the members at Florence or to sign the laws passed there, because that was not the capital. So both the Omaha and the Florence legislatures went home, at the end of forty days, with nothing done. Soon after this Secretary of State Cuming died and J. Sterling Morton, leader of the South Platte section, was appointed by President Buchanan to fill the place. Governor Black — The fourth governor of the territory, Samuel W. Black, Democrat, of Pennsylvania arrived at Omaha, May 2. </seg>
            <seg id="p665">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 1859. The feud between the North and South Platte regions had now become so bitter, the South Platte people resolved that they would no longer live in Nebraska. The South Platte Tries to Secede — They determined to secede and join Kansas, taking the entire South Platte country with them. To this end they sent delegates to Kansas and to Washington asking Congress to separate the South Platte region from Nebraska and join it to Kansas. This attempt failed, but the quarrel between the North and South Platte regions went on. As a State Lincoln the New State Capital— The new state Nebraska had a new capital. During the long fight between the North and South Platte sections, the South Platte, being nearer to the settled states and further from the hostile Indians, had outgrown the North Platte. Thus it had more votes in the legislature of 1866 which passed an act to remove the capital from Omaha. The new capital was named for President Lincoln, and the name was given by its enemies. Otoe county had led the fight for removal of the capital from Omaha. Its members in the legislature had been opposed to President Lincoln. The North Platte members who wished to keep the capital at Omaha moved to make the name Lincoln, thinking that the Otoe county legislators would refuse to vote for a capital so named. But the ruse failed; their votes were cast for the bill and Lincoln became the name of our capital, instead of Douglas as was suggested in the removal bill of 1857. Three men, Governor David Butler, Secretary Thomas P. Kennard and Auditor John J. Gillespie, were appointed to locate the new capital, which was to be at some point within the counties of Saunders, Butler, Seward and Lancaster. On July 29, 1867, they selected the present site between Salt and Antelope creeks, which was then open prairie with only two or three log cabins. The Great Immigration— When Nebraska became a state, the war between the North and South was over, the hostile Indians had been defeated along the frontier and thousands of immigrants poured west in search of free homes. They came in all possible ways, up the Missouri river in steamboats, some on railroads across Iowa, bur more came in covered wagons or "prairie schooners" as they were called, drawn by horses, mules, or oxen. In these came the pioneers with their children; often with a box of chickens tied on behind, while a few cattle and the family dog brought up the rear. All the roads leading into and across Nebraska were white with these landships, and soon the valleys and prairies of the eastern half of the state were dotted with dark spots, where they had anchored and the men and women in them had begun to break the prairies </seg>

SLAVERY IN NEBRASKA From Sheldon's History and Stories of Nebraska ■n Nebraska the people never voted for slavery, but people g here from the South brought slaves with them. In were thirteen slaves in Nebraska and in 1860 there were ten. of these were held at Nebraska City. Across the Missouri river at Tabor, Iowa, was a settlement of people called abolitionists, because they wished to abolish slavery. The "Underground Railroad" was the name given to the road taken by the slaves from the South on their way North to Canada, where they were free. One branch of this road ran from Missouri through the corner of Nebraska by way of Falls City, Little Nemaha, Camp Creek, and Nebraska City to Tabor. The runaway slaves traveled at night along this road and were fed and hidden during the day by friends. At Falls City they were kept in a barn. John Brown came through this corner of Nebraska very often with slaves from Missouri whom he was helping to set free. He is the man of whom we sing John Brown's body lies a-mould'ring in the grave His soul is marching on!" In November, 1858, Eliza, a slave girl owned by Mr. Nuckolls at Nebraska City, ran away, and with her another slave girl. Mr. Nuckolls (after whom Nuckolls county was named) was very angry and offered $200 reward. With the aid of the United States marshall he began a search of the houses at Tabor for his slaves. The girls were not there, but one man whose house was being searched was struck on the head by an officer and badly wounded. For this Mr. Nuckolls had to pay (10,000 damages. Eliza escaped to Chicago, where she was arrested the next year and was about to be returned to her master when a mob rescued her and she was hurried over to Canada. Mr. Nuckolls sued sixteen Iowa people for helping Eliza to escape, but the war soon came on and he did not win his suit. The few slaves in Nebraska were hard to hold.

THE ORIGIN OF ARBOR DAY How to protect our forests from wanton depredation and how to increase their growth, how to arouse public sentiment in all forestry matters, have, during the past forty years, often been con - sidered by congress, by our state legislatures, by our agricultural societies, and by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The first to call attention in this country in an impressive way to the value and absolute need of forests, their influence upon climate and rainfall, the necessity for their culture and growth, was the late G. P. Marsh, of Vermont, for many years our representative at the courts of Italy and Turkey. In Europe he found the forests regarded as the most valuable crop which the ground can produce and every effort made to stimulate their growth to the utmost. In 1864 he called the attention of the American people to the ruthless destruction of their forests, the resultant effects on streams, climate, commerce and national conditions, and advocated systematic measures for curtailing their waste and consumption. This was the first clear, strong, statement of the needs of forest legislation and forest pro- </seg>

"This was the establishment of Arbor Day, or tree planting day. It was the happy thought of this pioneer settler on the treeless plains of Nebraska, who knew and felt the value of trees about the home, as well as their importance for the many uses of life, to enlist his neighbors and his fellow settlers throughout the state, by a common impulse, growing out of common wants and feelings, in the work of tree planting on one and the same given day. By his effort the 10th day of April, 1872, was adopted as Arbor Day in his state, and on that Arbor Day, the first ever observed in our country, more than 1,000,000 trees were planted. Since that time we learn that more than 1,000,000,000 trees have been planted and are now in a healthy, growing condition in that state through the united efforts of the school children and their parents on Arbor Day. All these trees are now thriving in a state on whose grassy plains scientists had often declared that trees would not grow, the few specimens formerly existing there being found along its water courses and streams. Nebraska was once almost a treeless area. Now it is a state with millions of young growing trees, due almost wholly to the Arbor Day planting started by the Hon. J. Sterling Morton in 1872. So con - tagious was the spirit of tree planting and Arbor Day observance originating in Nebraska that in the course of the next twenty years every state and territory except Delaware, Utah and Indian Terri - tory had enacted laws relating to tree planting and the observation of Arbor Day." The first Arbor Day proclamation was made by Governor Robert W. Furnas of Nebraska, in which he set apart the third Wednesday in April, 1874, as Arbor Day. Since then a similar proclamation has been issued annually by the governors of Nebraska, and in 1885 an act was passed by the legislature designating the 22d of April Mr. Morton's birthday, as the date for Arbor Day, and making it one of the legal holidays of the state. The legislature of 1895 by joint resolutions designated Nebraska as the "Tree Planter's State": and adopted the "Golden Rod" (Solidago serotina) as the floral p rn bl6m . The originator of the idea lived long enough to see Arbor Day adopted in more than forty states and territories, to record milllions and millions of trees added to the growing prosperity of the states, to note thousands of school houses change cheerless surroundings for those of comfort and beauty, and to feel that in stimulating the planting of trees he had been an active factor in fostering a love for the school, the home and our country. </seg>

The forests will have no less attention by the change; the birds will have more fruit to feed upon; the child - ren, 'to whom the world belongs,' will so learn to 'mend their ways' as to relieve our country of this stigma of having the worst roads of all civilized nations. "A good road is beautiful in all seasons, for it is properly built. There is no mud in wet weather, nor dust in dry weather, on a good road. Bordered by pleasant shade trees, so planted that one does not travel in the gloom of a forest, but in alternating shadow and sunlight, a good road gathers to itself many travelers. They pass with pleasant greetings. Feeling no discomfort, they are friendly toward all mankind. The good road draws to its neighborhood good farms and good homes. It is worth while to raise large crops where they are easily taken to market. The resulting prosperity shows itself in the homes men build. The good road fills the country churches. It stands for neighborliness, and, best of all, it leaves good schools all along its line. It calls the city boy to the country, not to live, perhaps, but for pleasure, to teach him to walk and to know the birds and God's out-of-doors.

How the trees sent forth their branches When with cool refreshing waters, Bathing every branching rootlet I repaid their living watch-care! How the birds sang in those tree tops Made all Nature glad to hear them! While, with hearts o'erfilled with music Joyfully I joined their chorus. How I laughed to see this gladness; Laughed, and danced, and whirled, and As with consciousness of good done, On my way I coursed this hollow! chattered, "Then an evil day befell me, I the woodman's sounding ax-blows hed among my mute defenders, them low — those haughty nobles them low and showed no mercy, the sun glared down upon me, hed my springs and drank my life my fainting body vanished blood; Bme here to haunt these regions my discontented spirit. tack! lover of the streamlet, 1 the men and teach the children: the trees and spare the forest, the sun's devouring passion not from the soil its moisture, not from the streams their bodies ing drouth and desolation."

So any nation which in its youth lives only for the day, reaps without sow - ing, and consumes without husbanding, must expect the penalty of the prodigal, whose labor could with difficulty find him the bare means of life. A people without children would face a hopeless future; a country without trees is almost as hopeless: forests which a - used that they can not renew themselves will soon vanish, and with them all their benefits. A true forest is not merely a storehouse full of wood, but, as it were, a factory of wood, and the same time a reservoir of water. When you help to preserve our forests or to plant new ones you are acting the part of good citizens. The value of forestry deserves, therefore, to be taught in the schools, which aim to make good citizens of you. If your Arbor Day exercises help you to realize what benefits each one of you receives from the forest, and how by your assistance those benefits may continue, they will serve a good end.

The young should plant trees in recognition of the obligations they owe to those who planted trees for them. The old should plant trees to illustrate their hope for the future, and their concern for those who are to come after them. The economist should plant trees, especially in the prairie country, and beautify the landscape and ameliorate the sweep of the north wind. And as we plant trees on Arbor Day a kindred feeling to that experienced on the Fourth of July should possess us.

THE KITTEN AND THE LEAVES The leaves sprang up one autumn day, And said, "Hurrah for one good play. We've been tied all summer to that old tree And now we'll go off and have a spree." So the merry brown leaves, they ran and ran, And chased and raced as brown leaves can. They leaped and danced in a wild quadrille, Around and around, as brown leaves will. </seg>

And I saw them, too, as I went to work, For they flew in my face with the sauciest jerk. And over the fence in a little back yard. Where the merry brown leaves were playing so hard, A Maltese kitten I saw as I stood. Was chasing the leaves as hard as she could. A dear little kitten, all silvery gray; Oh, how she and the leaves did play. And a lame little boy, with a pale little face, He laughed and laughed to see them race. He laughed and he laughed and he laughed so hard Sitting all alone in the little back yard, That I stopped my wheel and watched the fun That the leaves and the kitten had just begun. That night his mother, so kind and good. Beside the lame boy's cradle stood, And smiled, tho' a tear stood in her eye, To see the kitten beside him lie. She patted the kitten's silvery head, And smoothed the clothes as she softly said: "God bless the kitten, that brings such joy To my poor little, dear little, lame little boy.' And the saucy leaves at the cottonwood's feet Called out to the wind ere they went to sleep, "You wake us up early, at five, or at four, For we want to play with the kittens some more." Minnie J.

And the people said, when they saw them there, "The fairy umbrellas are out in the rain: O Spring has eome'so sweet and so fair. For there are those odd, little toadstools again.' G. Packard Du Boit HISTORY OF BIRD DAY "Native labor is of little value to us because nearly every other day is a public or religious holiday." Thus spoke a prominent con - tractor of the present conditions in South America. Too many holidays! The same complaint has been urged against the schools. Too many holidays! Celebrations of birthdays, anniversaries, special days, etc., are said to be taking up too much of the time of school children. Then it must indeed be for a very good reason that a new holiday is proposed. Superintendent C. A. Babcock of Oil City, Pa., thought he had a good reason for a new holiday and so proposed the observance of Bird Day. As far as is known he was the first to publicly propose the setting aside of one day in the year for the study of birds. In 1894 he wrote the Secretary of Agriculture at Washington, urging the establishment of such a day, and in reply Mr. J. Sterling Morton, at that time the Secretary, said the suggestion had his "cordial approval." Then we may say that May 3, 1894, was the first Bird Day. Exercises were held in Oil City, Pa., and consisted of com - positions, poems, talks and discussions about birds. The interest was good and the idea seemed to be one which would be very generally accepted. The following year the Oil City schools had another Bird Day, and it has since become a regular event in the schools of that city. Of course the papers discussed the new holiday, some calling it a fad, others commending the idea. The discussion spread to the west, and in 1896 we find Ft. Madison, Iowa, celebrating Bird Day. Superintendent Morrill, in describing the first Bird Day in Iowa, said "I never saw children so enthusiastic in preparation. The children brought their pet birds and the building rang with bird music all day long." She same year our own Professor Bruner of the University of ska urged the idea of Bird Day in the schools. He said, " We have a Bird Day, just as we have a Flag Day or an Arbor when suitable exercises should be held." About this time the tment of Agriculture issued a circular on Bird Day in the </seg>
            <seg id="p697">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT Schools, warmly urging the idea on the teachers and superintendents throughout the country. ■ rom far away New Mexico, from California, Florida and ylvania, and even from Boston come reports of successful Day celebrations. In our own state the day has been observed in a quiet way in several places. A number of cities and villages and more country schools have had successful Bird Days and are planning others. A special program is the usual method of bringing the birds before the pupils. These programs consist of lists of birds seen in the vicinity, observations on their habits, pictures of their nests and eggs, notes on their value and abundance and talks about their protection with a few choice poems or bits of literature given as recitations. In some schools a quarter holiday is given when the pupils are expected to give their time to walks in the woods and fields, watching the actions and learning of the lives of these feathered friends. Khe Nebraska Ornithologists' Union was organized in 1909 for urpose of encouraging the study of birds in the schools and ly approves of the idea of Bird Day. The observance of the day is becoming more general every year and during the coming year a number of schools are expecting to have their first Bird Day. The movement is encouraged by the Audubon Societies and Clubs for the protection of our native birds because they realize the need of just such work as is accomplished by Bird Day. It is hard to see why the time should be far distant when Bird Day will be as well known and as generally observed as any other Special Day.— Wilson Tout. (Written especially for the Nebraska edition of Special Day Programs. 1903) ROBIN'S MATE Everybody praises Robin, Singing early, singing late; But who ever thinks of saying A good word for Robin's mate?

Exhibiting the inextinguishable fervor of a Jean d'Arc or a ce Nightingale, Miss Anna Jarvis has worked incessantly toward tainment of her ideal general observance of a day when the ; that is justly hers will be paid mother the world over. It was a postage stamp that inaugurated the movement six years ago, when Miss Jarvis mailed a note to a friend inviting her to spend the second Sunday in May at her home to commemorate the date of her mother's death. It was then that the daughter disclosed her desire to dedicate a day to all mothers. EFhe following year found the movement prospering. And on 10, 1908, Philadelphia celebrated Mothers' Day in church and The year had been an extremely busy one for little Miss s no one can fully realize just how busy. And when the great arrived she was too ill to carry out all of her plans for its ration. But to those who knew nothing of her strenuous efforts is amazing that so wide a publicity had been given to the idea. Had she so desired Miss Jarvis could have told of thousands of letters written to men prominent in public life, clergymen, influential leaders in the business world, philanthropists, and others whose in - terest in the project she was desirous of gaining. She could have related her experiences when visiting reform schools, asylums, and other institutions, and could have told of personal pleas to senators, judges, and professors and immense sums from her own private in - come expended in furthering her endeavors. But in all her vigorous campaigning for the establishment of the day not a penny did she demand of anyone. Co-operation, consent, and a sympathetic reception for her plans were the only contributions sought. DAY OF WHITE CARNATION She discouragements she met were many. Like all pioneers, she all sorts of unforseen hindrances. Through everything, how - she persisted hopefully; and now, at last, she sees in the not mote future a time when Mothers' Day, with its emblematic carnation, its beautiful sentiment, shall be universally observed ■ one day in which all mankind, irrespective of race, religion, or might well join in celebrating. </seg>
            <seg id="p711">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT Even in that first year of its existence Mothers' Day was ob - served in many cities, for Miss Jarvis had bravely brought a resolu - tion before the senate of the United States to make the second Sunday in May a national holiday dedicated to the memory of "the best mother in the world, your mother." It was a difficult thing Kie quiet, home-loving little lady to take this step, but she succeeded in persuading Senator Burkett of Nebraska to pro - he resolution on May 8 on the floor of the senate. When the senator voiced the proposed resolution his colleagues greeted him at first with jeers and sarcastic derision. "Why not Father's Day?" shouted one. "I have a dear old aunt," yelled another. "Let's have Aunties' Day." And within a few moments Senator Burkett's voice was drowned in an ocean of laughter; but the good man from Nebraska continued to speak until his earnestness compelled more serious attention. Then, although the resolution waa slated until a later date, the purport of the senator's words had its effect; and next morning the newspapers the country over told of the new movement, some even commenting editorially upon Miss Jarvis' laudable project. And on the following day Mothers' Day was celebrated not only in Philadelphia but in various cities and com - munities throughout the union, thousands of men and women eagerly donning the white carnation symbolic of the constant purity of mother's love. In the churches the day was observed Dy special services. Miss Jarvis, with her characteristic thoughtfulness, made arrangements in her own city for mothers too old and infirm to walk to be conveyed to the houses of worship in carriages and automobiles. Everywhere men and women prominent in public and social life expressed their commendation of the new movement, paying loving tribute to mothers whose memories they held sacred, while in many households where the mother was still living family reunions were held sons, daughters, and grandchildren gathering 10 show their devotion. MISS JARVIS WORKING ABROAD That was five years ago. Now the celebration of Mothers' Day has become international. In England, where Miss Jarvis spent the greater part of last summer, she was able to make such an impres - sion that this spring the day will be observed throughout England and Ireland. The English, with their reverence for the lamented Queen Victoria, who was the best of mothers not only to her children but to every subject in her vast realm, were easily persuaded to join America in dedicating the second Sunday in May to mothers. In - tense interest in the movement has also been awakened in the German empire, and in Switzerland, at Zurich, Miss Jarvis will address the international Sunday School Congress to be held this summer. Eiss Jarvis speaks with utmost confidence; her arguments are straightforward, and convincing; seemingly without effort she i the most tender spots in the hearts of her listeners. I have </seg>

Matilda V. Edward* THE ESSENCE OF PATRIOTISM The essence of patriotism lies in a willingness to sacrifice for one's country, just as true greatness finds expression, not in blessings enjoyed, but in good bestowed. Read the words inscribed on the monuments reared by loving hands to the heroes of the past; they do not speak of wealth inherited, or honors bought, or of hours in leisure spent, but of service done. Twenty years, forty years, a life or a life's most precious blood be yielded up for the welfare of his fellows — this is the simple story which proves that it is now, and ever has been more blessed to give than to receive. The officer was a patriot when he gave his ability to his country and risked his name and fame upon the fortunes of war; the private soldier was a patriot when he took his place in the ranks and offered his body as a bulwark to protect the flag; the wife was a patriot when she bade' her husband farewell and gathered about her the little brood over which she must exercise both a mother's and a father's care; and if there can be degrees in patriotism, the mother stood rirst among the patriots when she gave to the nation her sons, the divinely appointed support of her declining years, and as she brushed the tears away, thanked God that He had given her the strength to rear strong and courageous sons for the battlefield.

There was the mother; the boy stood nigh With a shameless look, and his head held high, Age had come over her, sorrow and care; These mattered but little so he was there, A prop to her years and a light to her eyes, And prized as only a mother can prize; But what for him could a mother say, Waiting his doom on sentence day? Her husband had died in his shame and sin; And she a widow, her living to win, Had toiled and struggled from morn till night, Making with wearisome want a fight. — Bent over her work with a resolute zeal, Till she felt her old frame totter and reel, Her weak limbs tremble, her eyes grow dim; But she had her boy and she toiled for him. And he — he stood in the criminal dock, With heart as hard as a flinty rock, An impudent glance and a reckless air. Braving the scorn of the gazers there; Dipped in crime and encompassed around With proof of his guilt by captors found; Ready to stand, as he phrased it, "game," Holding rot crime but penitence shame Poured in a flood o'er the mother's cheek The moistening prayers where the tongue was weak And she saw through the mist of those bitter tears Only a child in his innocent years; She remembered him pure as a child might be.

Their letters from home, full of tenderness, of love and cheer, nerved the arm and fired the heart to noble deeds. The sister that did the part of brothers, the wife that did the noble duty of provider and protector, the "girl you left behind you," whose white hands were nightly folded in prayer to the God of Battle for your safety and return, the mother who willingly, yet sadly, gave the boys on whom she looked with pride, — must be counted among our heroes and receive our homage. I have heard men speak with pride of the Spartan mother who sent forth her son saying, — "Come back with your shield or upon it," and who rejoiced when her son fell in battle; but I point with higher pride to the noble American mother who shed tears as she bade her boy good-bye, and who, all excited and pale, looked over the lists of killed and wounded after each battle and, finding her son's name there, sank despairing to the floor. But women's work was not wholly at home. What soldier will forget the sanitary com - mission and Christian commission, of which the best eulogy is simply to name.

We have had the galley, the Viking's ship, the frigate, the ironclad and the dreadnought. But no limit can be placed to the abmitions of man as a builder and I ask you to join with me in proposing a toast to a ship, more potent than any which man has thus far employed in war — a ship with whose coming man's highest hopes will be realized, for there is noth - ing beyond.

The men threw all their weapons down At sight so strange and fair; They took the children in their arms, They stroked their flaxen hair. They kissed their cheeks and sweet red lips. They told how back at home, They'd left such little ones as these, And then they bade them come. To cherry orchards close at hand, And there they stripped the trees Of branches rich with clustered fruit Their little arms with these They filled, and with kind words of peace. They sent them back to town. The soldiers then all marched away, Nor thought of war's renown.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EIGHTEENTH OF MAY On the Eighteenth of May, 1899, an event took place which will always be remembered as a landmark in the history of mankind. Unlike most of the world's happenings, this occurrence affects equally every civilized nation on the globe, and it is necessary, therefore, that everybody should understand its meaning. The anniversary of this event has already been observed in many countries, and, like Christmas, the Eighteenth of May is destined to become a great international day, which will proclaim good will among men. Kn August, 1898, people all over the world were surprised by a which the Czar addressed to the nations that were represented ' Russian Court. This letter was an invitation to send delegates meeting which should consider what could be done to keep na - from going to war with each other. The Czar stated in his that, for the best welfare of the world, the nations ought to ct themselves in the spending of such enormous sums of money •mies and navies. THE CZAR'S PLAN FOR PEACE (Phe Czar had been considering this matter for some time. He, ver, was not the only ruler who had thought seriously about condition of affairs, and his invitation to attend a peace con - ce met with unanimous response. Every Government invited ited, and this included all the nations of Europe, twenty in &gt;er, four from Asia, and two in America, the United States and CO. ■On account of the unique nature of the conference, the Czar ght it best not to hold it in the capital of any one of the Great </seg>
            <seg id="p746">Powers, where so many political interests are centered. He felt that this might hinder the work in which all the countries of the world were equally interested. Holland was selected as the country most admirably adapted for such a meeting. It was announced to the Governments that the Queen of the Netherlands would offer hos - pitality to the conference, and accordingly the Netherlands mi of foreign affairs sent out a formal invitation to the Governmei meet at The Hague. THE YOUNG Ql'EEN's INVITATION I he young queen, who was then only eighteen years old, to her appreciation of the honor conferred on her country, and of eep meaning of the conference, placed at its disposal the most iful and historical building in the land. The conference was, ore, held in the widely famed House in the Woods, formerly immer residence of the royal family, situated in a very beautiful about a mile from the city. This was a most remarkable gathering, for each nation had sent its greatest statesmen. Then, too, it was the first time in the world's history that a peace conference had been held by the na- THE HOISE IN THE WOODS When these one hundred delegates, representing twenty-six of the most important nations of the world, came together on the eighteenth of May, 1899, it was fitting that their meeting place should be noted in history, since they were destined to become the historic figures of a great event in world affairs. The large ballroom, known as the Orange Zaal, was designated for the general meetings. The walls and dome of this hall are covered with immense paintings. One of these, over the front entrance, represents Peace descending from Heaven, and apparently entering the hall. M. de Beaufort, the honorary president of the conference, referred to this in his opening address, and expressed the hope that Peace, having entered the hall, would go forth to bless the whole world. The other large rooms on the main floor, handsomely furnished with beautiful Chinese and Japanese hangings, with the walls and ceilings finely frescoed, were given up to committees, into which the whole conference was di - vided. Upstairs, there was a dining room, in which the Dutch Government served a most bounteous lunch to the delegates every working day of the conference. TOPICS DISCUSSED Baron de Staal, head of the Russian delegation, was appropriately chosen president. Three main topics had been proposed for dis - cussion, and these were assigned to three large committees. The first was in charge of the question of armaments. Though the Czar had </seg>
            <seg id="p747">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT called the conference chiefly to consider how the nations might be relieved from spending such vast sums of money for their armies and navies, the committee which had this matter in charge found that the time had not yet come for deciding this burning question. The nations, they thought, must first agree not to go to war before they could be induced to give up their implements of war. The committee, therefore, came to no positive agreement. They unan - imously expressed the belief, however, that if the nations would stop spending such a large part of their incomes for armaments it would be a blessing to mankind. This was greatly to be desired, they said. They also expressed the hope that the Governments would study this question, so that they might come to some future agreement. The second committee, that on the laws of war, adopted new rules which make war on land less barbarous and extends the Red Cross to naval warfare. CHOOSING AN UMPIRE The key to the whole subject, and that which became the most important part of the program, is how to end a dispute before war begins. Many differences between nations have been settled without war by calling in a third party, just as an umpire on the ball field is called upon to decide which side is in the right. Wouldn't it look ridiculous, if the two teams in a ball game should, every time a disputed point arose, stop the game and go to fighting to settle the matter? And how would it look to the spectators to see the ad - vantage given to a side merely because it was stronger in the fist scramble? And yet this is exactly what nations do which go to war to settle disputes. How stupid to think that might can settle who is in the right. WAR NO LONGER NECESSARY These great statesmen at The Hague, who composed the third committee, recognized the folly of such a method of settling dis - putes and adopted a plan which encourages the nations to refer all their disputes to an umpire or arbiter — in other words, to submit their differences to arbitration. In fact, the plan which this com - mittee adopted makes it absolutely unnecessary for nations to go to war with each other in the future. What an important plan. To save for the people of the world over $2,000,000,000 a year, not to speak of the suffering and misery which war always brings. In the nineteenth century more than 14,000,000 able-bodied men were sacrificed in war. The committee on arbitration divided its work into three parts. It said, first, that if two nations have a dispute, serious enough to cause war, they might call in another nation or nations who would view the matter with them in an impartial light and thus try to bring about a friendly settlement. A further important statement wa« made -that one or more powers, strangers to the dispute, might. </seg>
            <seg id="p748">of their own free will, oner their Assistance. This provision, culled "Special Mediation by Neutral Powers," certainly meant a great change in the attitude of nations toward each other. THE PEACE OF PORTSMOUTH Before this rule was adopted any offer on the part of any nation to intercede or intervene between two powers at variance would have been considered an unfriendly act and would probably have occasioned jealous distrust. We can see how important this provision is by the action of President Roosevelt, who, during the war between Russia and Japan, invited these two powers to send delegates to a meeting which he hoped might bring about the end of one of the most terrible wars in history. During this conference, which was held in Portsmouth, N. H., and which ended in the Peace of Portsmouth, the people of the world looked on with in - terest and sympathy it was the common hope that war should cease. The second part of the plan, which the committee on arbitration adopted, stated that a useful method of avoiding war between nations might be to appoint committees composed of men from other countries, which should inquire into the disputed case. Such com - mittees were called "International Commissions of Inquiry." For a long time the delegates discussed this matter, and it seemed almost as if they would come to no agreement. The act was finally ap - proved, however, although it was stated that only those cases which had nothing to do with the honor or essential interests of a nation would be considered as coming under this rule. THE "DOGGER BANK AFFAIR But six years after the conference adjourned, this provision enabled the powers of Great Britain and Russia to settle speedily and peacefully a grave dispute which had arisen between them. When, during the Russian-Japanese war, the Russian fleet fired on the British fishing vessels, there was great excitement in England. Before 1899 she might have plunged into war, for her honor had been touched. Her citizens had been fired on by a foreign fleet. But under this rule of inquiry, England could honorably refer this matter to an investigating committee. One was appointed, which proved that the Russian ship had mistaken the British fishing vessels for the Japanese fleet. The committee recommended that an in - demnity of $350,000 be paid by the Russian Government to the families of the English fishermen. This was gladly done and both sides were satisfied with the outcome of this unhappy occurrence. The " Dogger bank affair," as this was called, will always be re - garded as an important event in world affairs. THE HAGUE COURT OF ARBITRATION But the crowning glory of the Committee on Arbitration, and </seg>
            <seg id="p749">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT court where nations in dispute could take their cases and have them tried, just as people living in the various countries can refer their controversies to the courts for settlement. This court was to be the umpire or arbiter, and, therefore, it was called the International Court of Arbitration. Since this is situated at the Hague, it is sometimes called The Hague Court of Arbitration. The importance of this court was well understood by those far-sighted statesmen, who adopted every measure possible which could make the court useful to nations. They passed a rule saying that it was the duty of each power to remind disputants that the court existed. This has well proved its worth, for since it was opened in April, 1901, eleven cases of international controversy, representing nearly every great nation of the world, have been settled by its judges. The American people like to remember that it was the United States and Mexico that took the first case there. THE HAGUE PALACE OF PEACE The future headquarters of the International Court of Arbitra - tion is situated on the avenue leading from The Hague to Scheven - ingen. At present the passer-by sees nothing but a great fore scaffolding, which is to be seen on the left, a little distance from the road. Among the scaffold poles, however, is rising the Palace of Peace, toward the erection and maintenance of which Mr' Andrew- Carnegie gave the Netherlands Government the sum of $1,500,000. The corner stone of this building was laid at the time of the second Hague conference in 1907. The use of this court has convinced the nations more and more that arbitration is the only sane and sensible way of settling inter - national difficulties, and since the first Hague conference over a hundred agreements have been made between nations to submit certain classes of disputes to arbitration. Thirty-six nations have thus expressed their desire to use the court, while the United States is a party to twenty-five of these treaties.

THE ARBITRATION TREATIES NEGOTIATED BY THE INITED STATES WITH GREAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE The arbitration treaties negotiated by the United States with Great Britain and France enlarge the field of arbitrable subjects embraced in the treaties ratified by the three Governments in 1908 The treaties provide for reference to The Hague, or a similar tribunal, questions which have heretofore been left entirely to diplomatic negotiation. They provide for the creation of a Joint High Com - mission, to which shall be referred any controversy between this Government, on the one hand, and Great Britain or France, on the other, before such controversy has been submitted to an arbitral body from which there is no appeal. Moreover, the treaties provide that reference of a controversy to the Joint High Commission may be deferred for one year, thus allowing diplomatic adjustment without an appeal to the commission. The Joint High Commission, according to the treaties, consists of three representatives from each Government concerned in the dis - pute. The commission is empowered to report to the respt Governments its recommendations and conclusions, and then the matter is ready for final arbitration. The Senate of the United States, concurring with the President, has the power to determine for this country if the case shall go to The Hague Court. Thus, under these treaties, the United States may go directly to the Court of Arbitration at The Hague or to the Joint High Commission. The report of this commission is not binding, except where opinions differ as to whether or not the question at issue is subject to arbitration under the first article of the treaties. If such is the case, five out of six members of the commission must so decide and the verdict is conclusive upon both Governments. THE SECOND PEACE CONFERENCE Khe results of the first peace conference are far greater than the ever dreamed of. And perhaps the greatest result of all was lling of a second peace congress, which was held in 1907, and included practically all the nations of the world. r'ourteen decisions were agreed upon by this conference, but the important was the one which concerned the Hague Court world umpire, situated at The Hague, had shown its ability to </seg>
            <seg id="p751">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT settle any dispute that might arise between nations; but the second peace conference made this doubly assured. These statesmen decided that, in case of a conflict between two powers, either of them might go to the court and ask to have the difference settled, even though the other were unwilling to have the case referred. This was indeed a great improvement over the rule made by the first peace conference, which compelled both nations to agree to submit their difference to the court before it could be tried. Our American delegates at The Hague, who brought this matter up, believed that no nations would refuse to allow the case to go before the court when the request of the other was thus made public to the whole world. A SUPREME COURT OF THE WORLD Our American delegates in the second Hague conference urged very strongly the establishment of a permanent international court, which should be to the nations of the world what our Supreme Court is to the States of the United States. Eight years before, at the first peace conference, the delegates thought that it would be perfectly impracticable to have such a court, but this conference decided unani - mously that it was not only practicable but very desirable. Every - thing was agreed upon which should make the court a reality except the method of selecting judges. This matter will undoubtedly be settled before long. As Ambassador Choate and Secretary Hay said in their report to the United States Government, "a little time, a little patience, and the great work is accomplished." THE THIRD PEACE CONFERENCE Perhaps the greatest service which the second peace conference gave to the world was its decision in favor of holding regular confer - ences. This not only laid the foundation for a Parliament of the Nations, which has been the dream of poets and statesmen for the past three centuries, but, by its vote providing for a third conference, it has really started the most wonderful institution in promoting the peace of the world. It was Secretary Root who first proposed that the second conference should arrange for the holding of regular ones in the future, and as the vote was passed, a third peace conference will probably convene in the summer of 1915. — Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews, Secretary American School Peace League. </seg>
