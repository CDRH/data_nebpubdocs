However, most of the publications refer to methods used in eastern States or in the Northwest which are not adapted to conditions and varieties in the Middle West. There is a great demand for information along these lines in Nebraska, especially among the newer residents of the State, who are planting young orchards and vineyards. In order to meet this demand it is con - sidered advisable to publish a bulletin which will incorporate the exj&gt;erience of practical growers and the results of scientific inves - tigations. There has been considerable confusion of the terms pruning and training. The term pruning is applied to the various opera - tions which consist in cutting off or removing certain portions of the plants. The term training, on the other hand, refers to the different methods of shaping the plant other than the cutting away of its parts, such as bracing to spread the tops of trees, tying the branches in certain positions, etc. The term training is often used to denote the process of changing the shape and the apparent direction of growth of a limb by cutting away certain of its parts. This, however, more properly belongs to 1 1 1*11 n i nff Different methods of pruning must be practiced on different varieties and kinds of fruit and on trees of the same varieties Inn of different ages. Most varieties of fruit trees make a much more vigorous and upright growth while young than when mature, tho some persist in spreading from the first. These spreading varieties need different treatment from the upright growers. In fact, every individual tree will require somewhat different treat - ment, for no two are just alike, tho they may belong to the same variety. A much greater difference must, therefore, l&gt;e expected lK'tween different varieties. In order to prune intelligently the prnner must understand the habits of the individual tree or at least of the variety. Especially is this true of the fruiting habits. EXTENSION BUL SO. 88, AGR.

PHYSIOLOGY OF PRUNING. Konnds are healed by plant food elaborated in the leaves, material takes an inward and downward course thru the bark from the smaller to the larger limbs and to the . As wounds very far removed from its direct path receive little, if any, plant food, long stubs rarely, if ever, heal Cuts should be made close to, and parallel with, the limit l.

This often leaves :i larger 1 than if the limb is cut straight across, but it is one which more quickly. A cut made just above a bud or branch has a tendency lo </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 to utilize the water and plant food which formerly went to supply a much larger area. Kut below a bud or limb has a tendency both to produce a ing of the parts, because of the stored plant food, and to the formation of fruit buds. Water sprouts are the direct of a disturbed equilibrium of the tree. Heavy pruning produces water sprouts regardless of the season of the hen it is done. When the top of a tree is cut back, the indance of water and food materials supplied by the Dree dormant and adventitious buds into growth. ( 'hecking growth as long as the plant remains strong and healthy has a tendency to promote fruitfulness. A very strong growth is always at the expense of fruit bearing. Overcultiva - tion and manuring may often pause the plant to grow so rapidly as to he unfruitful. Heavy pruning may do the same. Other conditions being equal, deep notching of the twig above the bud tends to produce a long, wood} 1 spur. Heading-in tends to start shoots from the lateral buds, and a strong vegetative growth results. Under normal conditions there is perfect balance between the top and roots of the plant. The top and roots must supply and support each other. If a large part of the top is pruned away, there is more food for the remaining branches. The result is a greater growth of these parts and rejuvenation of the plant. When plants begin to decline from general debility, manure or prune, or both, removing the weakest parts first. If it is desired to save any certain branch, a heavy pruning of the others will assist the chosen one. If the branches are too weak to rejuvenate, suckers may be produced by heavy pruning, which may be trained into a new head. Heavy pruning will go further toward rejuvenating a tree which suffers from winter injury than any other remedy. If it is necessary to prune severely to correct the shape of the trees aud it is desirous to avoid excessive growth, the parts should be removed gradually. Heavy pruning of the roots tends to lessen the production of wood, since the food supply is cut off. Root pruning has the same effect as poor feeding. I lit bearing is often determined as much by the condition nvironment of the tree as by the kind and extent of pruning, he fruiting habit is always more amenable when the tree ing than when it is old. Any treatment which disturbs the brium of a tree tends to modify its bearing habit. Tf trees never borne, it may be possible to induce bearing: First, by ring the management of the land, so as to modify the supply k food material ; second, by pruning or changing the methods </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 of pruning; and third, by controlling insects and disease. Heavy pruning adds vigor and produces new wood. The orchard is thus renovated and rejuvenated. After two or three years, the trees begin to steady down and bear fruit, unless the orchard is allowed to lapse into its former condition. The common habit of heavy pruning every two or three years is one of the best means of keeping the trees unbalanced. Light pruning every year is more beneficial than the same amount of pruning given only occa - sionally or in alternate years. Iny varieties of apples develop long slender branches which under a load of fruit, while some other varieties are liable to ar periodically, often to such an extent that branches are i with a load of undersized fruit. Such trees require two 8 to recover from the effect of overbearing, but the third he process is repeated. Pruning may be, therefore, a means of thinning the fruit and of contributing to the control of the bearing habits of the plants. The bearing yt w of fruit trees may often be changed by removing the crop earlier in the season, but the tree tends to revert to its accustomed habit. TIME TO PRUNE. There is no one season in which wounds always heal better than another. Healing depends primarily upon the cambium and cannot take place except when the cambium is active. The cam - bium is usually inactive in late fall and winter, and there is a tendency for the tissues to die back about the edges of the wound made at this time. This is a disadvantage to the healing process. Pruning in the spring or growing season exposes the plant to bleeding. It is said that the sap sours on exposure to the air and injures the bark and cambium about the edges of the wound. This, however, is very doubtful. On account of the stubs dying back, pruning back of terminal growths had better be done late in the dormant season rather than early in the fall. The season in which pruning is done has some influence on fruit bearing. Winter pruning tends to produce wood, while summer pruning has a tendency to promote fruit bud formation. IMants cut in midsummer have power to adjust themselves, while plants which are pruned in winter have expended all their energy. Fruit buds must not be expected to form in the same year in which pinching or heading back is done. There is no question but that if heading-in is done before active growth has ceased it has a tendency to induce fruitfulness by checking exuberant f7Tt i w t li fl i\{\ h v p n f*on i* ji cH no' short In tp?**i 1 Tow*t li^ oi* m}i ni*t snnr- </seg>

Apples and pears have similar fruiting habits. The fruit is borne almost altogether from terminal buds on the ends of short, crooked branches, known from their habits as fruit spurs. Many varieties, however, especially when under irrigation, produce ter - minal fruit buds on the current year's growth and often in the axils of the leaves. All branch buds are alike in the beginning. Some, because of a more abundant supply of light and food, make a rank growth, while others for reverse reasons produce very short branches, which usually become or produce fruit spun. This is good evidence that slow growth favors fruitfulness. The fruit buds give rise to both blossoms and leaves, producing six to nine leaves usually surrounding three to seven blossoms. Under normal conditions on most of the standard varieties of apples, usually one, but sometimes two or more of these blossoms, set fruit, and the rest fall away. Pears as a rule set more fruit to a cluster tlian do apples, and crabs are famous for their habit of often setting fruit on all the buds in a cluster. Fig. 4.— Showing the fruiting habits of apples and pears. Note, first, the fruit buds at a and, second, the buds at 6 which next season will form only leaf buds, but the following season fruit buds. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Pruning Tree*, Vines, and Shrubs. 11 When a spur sets fruit, its terminal growth is stopped; but one or more leaf buds are formed just back of the place where the fruit is attached. The following season these make a short growth, and at the end of the second season they produce new fruit buds. This explains why trees form the habit of bearing in alternate years. If all the spurs are loaded one year, no fruit buds are formed for the next season's crop, unless they are pro - duced on the current year's growth. Since these crooked, scarred little spurs are responsible for most of the fruit crop, it is not surprising that the man who frequently removes all but the nice, straight limbs from his trees in an effort to make them look symmetrical will never be blessed with a large crop. Fruit spurs when once formed remain fruit spurs and con - tinue to bear for a great number of years unless forced into rapid growth by abnormal conditions, such as excessive pruning or heavy applications of fertilizer. Once a fruit spur is de - stroyed it us forever lost, and the loss cannot be replaced except by growing a new spur. This is often difficult in the extreme. In pruning apple and pear trees, then, it is of the utmost importance to preserve the fruit spurs. The pruning operation should consist in thinning out the top to admit air and light and never in removing the spurs, twigs, and small limbs from the lower portion of the tree. PRUNING YOUNG TREES AFTER PLANTING. SVhen the trees are taken from the nursery row, a large part le root system is left in the ground ; the equilibrium between roots and top of the tree is thus disturbed ; and it is obvious a part of the top should also be removed. Should the top eft unpruned, transpiration will take place too rapidly. The e amount of foliage requires more water and food material i the short root system can supply. Trees which have not cut back will often start growing too vigorously only to die n the food and water, which is stored in the plant, or which is ly available, is exhausted. All branches and torn roots should be cut back to healthy tissue, leaving smooth cuts that will readily heal. Long, straggly roots should be shortened, and any masses or tangled roots should be shortened and thinned. </seg>

Low headed trees have other advantages in that they afford greater ease in picking, thinning, pruning, and spraying, all of which operations can be i»erformed more satisfactorily ami cheaply. SHAPING THE YOUNG TREE. B training the trees, one of two modes may be adopted. One wn as the pyramidal or two-story and the other as the vase An expert may combine the two. A cotnliinatiou is pref - for the Middle West. The pyramidal form preserves the leader, which is trained to form a central shaft to the tree. It has the advantage of more bearing surface, as the leader continues to grow, and in time forms what is known as a two-storied tree. There are the usual objections to tall trees, on the other hand, in that it is difficult to secure good distribution of bearing wood, and some varieties, such as Gano and Ben Davis, are inclined to produce too many branches and to produce inferior fruit. There is also the danger from high winds. .Besides, much of the fruit is produced at the top of the tree and out of reach of pickers. Even if it can be reached, it causes delay and extra expense in picking. I the open-headed, or vase, form, the leader is done away with. mbs, usually not more than five, are chosen to form lite top. llful pruning, the spaces are all occupied with bearing wood way, and tall trees are avoided. One of the advantages of en head is that trees are not nearly so liable to die from 1 or fire blight, for when a limb becomes diseased it may ioved without endangering the whole tree. I he term low-headed is merely relative. Eighteen to twenty - inches is considered low. Some growers start even lower, trees should be well supplied with limbs at the point where lead is desired, and three to five of them should be chosen rni the framework of the tree- The others should be removed, selected branches should then be shortened to a sound bud in 10 to 14 inches of the main stem. In case the arrange - of the limbs is such that this is impossible, the entire top Id be removed without regard to branches. This will cause branches to push out on the young stock. This is one reason why strong yearling trees are preferable to older ones. When a tree is headed back, great pains should be taken to make a slanting cut just above a sound bud. A sharp knife is the best </seg>

There dency for the new limb to grow in the direction into which I points, tho this is not always true, especially if a tree is pruned back. SUBSEQUENT PRUNING OF YOUNG APPLES AND PEARS. ■ie first five or six years is the most critical stage in the life ; tree, for the pruning given while young determines in a measure its future usefulness. Immediately after being set out, the trees are pruned as al - n-ady described. Every season thereafter for several years the tree will need more or less care. The first attention should be given to the number, size, and distribution of the scaftold limbs. BMM varieties, such as Missouri Pippin, Wealthy, Oldenburg, etc., are much more difficult to prune and shape properly than Wiuesap, Black Twig, and other of the more spreading varieties. Sometimes one or more of the scaffold limbs have to be discarded and new limbs trained to fill the vacancy. It is necessary to be &lt;i instantly on the watch in order to secure proper shape. Lead - ers should be shortened usually about one-third to one-half their length, while the side limbs should be shortened one-fourth to one-third their length. K forks of both trunk and main branches should be avoided ly as possible, to prevent splitting. All crossed branches or those growing back into the center of the tree should be removed and the top kept thinned out. The second year, pruning follows closely after the practices of the first season. As a rule, unless a branch is cut near a strong lateral, two branches will start, and some of the buds lower down will develop into shoots. It is a good practice to allow two of these to grow on each of the previous year's limbs. One should be left near the end and the other farther back and be placed so as to avoid the formation of crotches. They should, however, be cut back one-half to two-thirds of their length and the laterals shortened to one or two buds, so that they may shade the branches and later develop fruit spurs. Ee horticulturists recommend the removal of all these spurs to protect the tree from fire blight, but on apples, in this region, all these spurs should be retained as long ible. Spaces should be filled by choosing branches that i the general direction of the vacancies, by cutting to a it is on the side toward the opening. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Pruning Trees, Vines, and Shrubs. 15 The third season, the trees should require less attention than before. Surplus branches and those that rub or are inclined to form crotches should be removed. Very vigorous growths should be headed-in. If a leader is desired, the treatment is practically the same, except that it is allowed to grow with little heading-in. Branches should be allowed to develop on the leader at regular gm this time on, the question is merely to retain good o prevent the formation of crotches and cross branches, ke out the excess branches so that sunlight may be ad - and the amount of bearing wood controlled. Should it necessary to prune to produce fruitfulness, it should be ghtly and in summer. PRUNING BEARING TREES. To many fruit growers of the Middle West, pruning bearing trees seems to be an extremely questionable undertaking, and it is true they have many arguments to support this belief. Tn the East it is necessary to thin out the trees and admit sunlight in order to mature and color the fruit properly, but in the Middle West under conditions of intense sunlight and low humidity good well-colored fruit may be grown without much pruning. There is sometimes danger of thinning out the trees too much and allowing both fruit and tree to be injured by sun scalding. Then, there is not the pressing necessity in the West which there is in the East of pruning to prevent the development of fungous diseases on the fruit and foliage, these pests being much less troublesome in drier climates. , Again, there is evidence which indicates that trees often become infected with diseases, espe cially Illinois canker, thru pruning wounds, tho with proper care this may be avoided. There are many other and often unreasonable excuses offered by the man who does not prune. Many contend that cutting away healthy branches is entirely contrary to the laws of nature and that when it becomes neces - sary the trees will prune themselves by shading off the super - fluous branches. They support their argument by citing the shading off and self-pruning of trees under forest conditions. In order to secure this self-pruning of trees, they must be planted so close together that even while young the branches interlock and interfere with each other. Such conditions are not ideal orchard conditions. The trees form long, slender, up right, growing branches which produce very little fruit. This, however, is well, for if they ware loaded with fruit they would </seg>

As before stated, in order to secure desirable results, a knowl - edge of the habits of growth and fruit bearing of the different kinds and varieties of fruit is necessary. Some varieties have a tendency to overbear more than others, and the more pronounced this tendency the heavier should be the pruning. The semiopen headed form or the story and one-half tree is the type best adapted to the Middle West. To secure this form, the thinning nut of the top should not be overdone by removing large branches, for this makes large holes in the top where there is no wood whatever. It should be confined to relatively small branches of about one-half to three-quarters of an inch in diameter. IB fruit spurs should always be preserved, and small les that are not fruit spurs should be saved as far as pos - for these may be trained into bearing spurs. There is a icy on the part of the amateur pruner to prune for looks i strip off these small branches and spurs in order to secure stry. The damage caused by two or three such primings can be overcome. All dead and diseased wood must be removed. Sometimes, however, as in case of a large cankered limb, the removal of it would throw the tree badly out of balance. Where the limb is on the south side of the tree, the removal of it would expose the trunk and other large limbs to excessive heat. In either case, if </seg>

For removing the diseased wood a two-inch gauge and a mallet make a valu - able addition to the pruning kit. In treating trees for canker we must divide them into three classes. The first includes those which may be cured profitably by ■-One medium sizid limb of this trtT has bren killed back to a bj nois canker.

Ill this class we have trees with all degrees of infection, i a small cankered spot on one limb up to several large cank »n one or more limbs. In general practice it is best to remove any diseased limbs entirely, unless the infections are recent or, as before stated, the limb is badly needed. In such cases it is well to try to treat </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 In treating the limb, all of the cankered and discolored bark and wood must be removed. It is safest to cut back of the cank - ered spot at least one inch into clean, growing bark.

After removing the canker and mak - ing a good smooth cut, the wound should be disinfected and covered. (See disinfectants and covers for wounds, p. 41.) </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Pruning Trees, Vines, and Shrubs. 19 Another important step in treating the canker is to cut the trees back heavily and force an abundance of new growth. Trees with heavy tops compared to the root systems, or those which have been weakened by any cauRe, such as drouth or Fig. 8.— The same tree as shown in Pig. 7 one year after treatment winter injury, suffer most severely from Illinois canker. (Jutting back the top so that the roots can better supply water and plant food to the remainder, goes a long way toward correcting the trouble. </seg>

For this class there is remedy but to cut them down and burn them. All leaders and side branches should be shortened to the desired length. In doing this, care should be exercised never to leave stubs, but to cut back to a side limb. Crossing and ingrowing branches and R rowing in such positions that bad crotches are likely to led should be removed. All water sprouts should be re - except where they may be trained into limbs to fill va - , or to replace fruit spurs on a limb which has been If left for limbs, they should be severely cut back, but taring wood they should be cut back to two buds. This e should be repeated each season. Essentially the same principles apply to pruning bearing ]&gt;ear trees as to apples. A mature pear tree does not require a great deal of pruning, if proper attention is given while young. Growers often accept the upright growing habit of the pear as inevitable and make no effort to train it otherwise. This is a mistake. There is no reason why a pear tree cannot be grown with a moderately low head if trained while young. Pear trees should be low headed for the same reason that apples should. It is a hard matter to head-in mature pear trees because of the large amount of growth thrown out the next year. When head - ing-in becomes a necessity, always cut two side limbs. There is no truth in the saying that pear trees will not stand pruning. Some varieties demand severe pruning in order to keep them within bounds. Just how much pruning to give is a question which the grower must decide for himself. The main object should be to thin the fruit, improve the quality, and encourage regular bearing. Heavy pruning often induces heavy growth. This should be avoided if possible, since pear blight is more destructive to trees making rank growth. The infection usually gains entrance thru the blossoms and more tender twigs. This is very serious when it occurs on short fruit spurs, and it often becomes necessary to remove them from the base of the larger limbs as a safeguard. Summer pruning is beneficial to pears as well as apples. PHJITING HABITS OF PEACHES. The fruit tearing habits of peaches are quite different from those of apples and ]»ears in that the fruit is borne on one-year - old wood and the buds are always simple, i. e., either flower buds or leaf buds, while in the case of apples and pears they are often produced from the same bud.

On rank growth, few buds are found except near the tip, and these are scattering. The fruit bearing area of a peach tree gradually grows higher and farther away from the body of the tree, so that the pruner has two objects in pruning: (1) To furnish new wood to bear fruit and (2) to keep it within reach of the pickers. There is a strong tendencj- for the fruit bearing area of young B trees, especially the leaders, to grow* out of bounds and be - too high, if not carefullj' pruned back. Too heavy pruning, 'er, may cause the tree to produce a light crop the following but it can be relied upon to repay the owner the second PRUNING YOUNG PEACH TREES. Practically the same rules may be followed in pruning young peach trees as are adhered to in the pruning of young apples and pears. Three or four main scaffold branches are left at the end of the first season. These are shortened to about twelve inches in length and allowed to divide into three or four branches during the next season's growth, with about the saiiie heading-in and multiplication of branches for the following season. After this time the form of the trees should be well established and less severe pruning should be necessary. Stone fruit trees respond readily to proj&gt;er pruning. They differ from the apple, as before mentioned, in habits of fruiting, in that the fruit buds are axillary and not terminal, and the fruit is borne on the one-year-old wood. The grower should take advantage of this knowledge when the tree is young and keep it within bounds. The tree will continue to need some thinning out and cutting back, but it is a mistake to prune for fruit too soon. It is impossible to prune young peach trees properly and leave fruit buds. The more rapid the growth of new wood the nearer the tips the fruit buds will be found. To secure a well-spreading top and have the fruit wood near the ground, it is necessary to prune severely the outside branches. Few fruit buds will be produced the following year. After the third year, the top of the tree should be cut back, but no more small wood should be left in the body of the tree than has been left before. All subse - quent pruning should be to keep the top fairly open. After the fourth year the trees need considerable thinning out and some cutting back. The fruit should be thinned out by cutting the iruiting wood and with such other pruning as the spread of the tree needs to keep the fruiting area near the ground. </seg>

The manner Fig. 12. — This is a good two-year-old peach. No. 1 shows the tree before pruning, and No. 2, after pruning. Note the manner of pruning to spread the top. K)ducing fruit-bearing wood makes this necessary, for even good pruning the fruiting area of the tree grows farther ! reach of the pickers. PRUNING BEARING PEACH TREES. In pruning bearing peaches the object should be to cut out enough wood to produce a strong new growth each year for fruit bearing, to remove superfluous fruiting wood, and to give the tree the desired shape. A mature peach tree should make an annual growth of 15 to 18 inches. This will necessitate the re - moval of much of the new wood. The heavier pruning should be done earlier in the spring, leaving the clipping back until later. Some wait until the danger of frost is past. Then, should fruit buds be killed, a heavy pruning is given. If they escape, only about half the longest branches are removed. The fruiting wood </seg>

An attempt to increase the fruiting depth will usually smother the inner growth of the tree. The spread should be increased rather than the height.

Peach trees may be dehorned to overcome the effects of winterkilling. FRUITING HABITS OF APRICOTS, PLUMS, AND CHERRIES. Apricots produce their fruit on one-year-old wood as does the peach, but by far the greater part of the fruit is borne on very short branches, which resemble fruit spurs. These short branches, however, do not differ very much from the other froit bearing wood of the tree except in vigor of growth. The buds here as on the other wood are axillary, but they are borne singly. On rank new wood the buds sometimes appear in small clusters. As in case of the peach, th^ buds are simple. They differ, however, from the peach in that they are developed in the axil of a single leaf. Plums and cherries resemble each other very closely in their fruiting habits. They differ slightly in some ways, but not any more than some varieties of plums differ from each other. They are alike in that the fruit buds, containing two to three flowers and a few often rudimentary leaves, are found both on short spurs and on the strong growing new wood, and in both cases from lateral buds. Few fruit buds of cherries are found on the vigorous new wood, the spurs being by far the heavier bearers. Japanese plums resemble apricots in their manner of fruiting. Ol many of the European and American varieties, fruit buds on new wood are common, while in sonic they are very rare. PRUNING APRICOTS, PLUMS, AND CHERRIES. Ee same principles are followed in pruning plums and cher - is with peaches, but they are pruned less severely. The spurs on apricots and plums often bear for a number of so that it is not necessary to force so much new growth as peaches, but since the bearing surface does occasionally o be renewed they are pruned more severely than apples. Bluch care must be exercised during the first few years of th of these plants to secure a proper distribution of the old limbs. Japanese plums and sweet cherries have a tend to divide into shoots of nearly equal growth and thus form crotches which split easily unless properly pruned. The same general principles apply to the pruning of apricots, plums, and cherries as apply to apples.

            <seg id="p028">28 so that after bearing age is attained little annual pruning is necessary except to remove dead or latoferiag limbs. The body of the plum is subject to injury from sun scald. To aroid this trouble, the trees should be headed low. Young trees of most varieties will need cutting back and to have the tops trimmed to develop the desired shape. Some varieties will need pruning to spread them, while others will need heading back to fill up the top of the tree. The bearing plum tree usually re - ceives only a moderate amount of pruning. Domestics are pruned very little after they reach the bearing age. The native plums will be improved in quality of fruit by moderate pruning, while the apricots and Japanese plums will respond satisfactorily to rather heavy pruning. When neglected they tend to overbear in alternate years. They should receive an annual heading-in and thinning out to force vigorous new growth. It is a common impression among fruit growers that mature cherry trees need no pruning. A great deal of this is due to indifference. It is true, however, that the greater part of the pruning should be done during the first three or four years. Good Pi borne on the cherry on one-year-old wood and on short s or spurs. The terminal bud is usually a branch bud. illary buds are mostly fruit buds. The cherry trees will, re, stand only moderate pruning. Trees overpruned pro - q excess growth of new wood and few fruit buds. The 1 plan should be to keep the fruiting area as near the ground as possible, to shade the trees, prevent sun scalding, and to encourage the growth of fruiting wood thruout the entire top. Sweet varieties will need heading-in to keep them within bounds. When weak fruit buds set and fail to produce fruit, it may be taken as a sign that the tree has not been pruned severely enough. Heavy pruning in the dormant season will often correct this fault. Lack of blooming is often due to excessive pruning. FRUITING HABITS OP GRAPES. » B Grapes differ from the tree fruits in their fruiting habits in t the fruit is borne upon shoots which grow from canes pro - ed the preceding year. Theoretically, each bud left on one - r-old canes will produce a shoot. The shoots which come from short jointed canes are the fruit bearers, and have from one to three or four clusters each. Therefore, the next season's crop can be estimated by considering the vigor of the vine and the number of buds left. Usually more buds are allowed to remain than would be needed were every one sure to produce fruit. Thirty </seg>

The position of the bnds or fruit bearing wood, so far as the quantity and quality of fruit are concerned, is of secondary im - portance, tho it is claimed by some that the third to the fifth buds of the cane produce more fruit each than the first or the rond. It is often necessary to renew a part or even the whole the top of the vine. It is desirable to have the bearing wood near the roots as possible. To secure the best results, the pruner must also consider the age, size, and vigor of the vine, and its environment, such as loca - tion, climate, soil, and the care it has received. The paramount object in pruning grapes is to secure the maximum amount of good fruit, and at the same time maintain a strong, healthy plant. In some cases the vine must be retarded by leaving con - siderable new wood. Often, vines must be heavily pruned, espe - cially where they are badly diseased, or attacked by insects, to promote the formation of healthy new wood. Old vines must often be heavily pruned for the same reason. Vines growing on rich, heavy soii will not bear as much pruning as those growing on light or sandy soil. The fruit is, as a rule, larger and later on heavily pruned vines. This is caused by an oversupply of sap. The more nearly upright a cane is the more sap will flow into it. Hence, the fruit is likely to be larger and later than the fruit on horizontal canes on the same vine. PARTS OP THE VINE DEFINED. A clear understanding of the different parts of the vine is necessary before the details of pruning and training can be satis - factorily considered. The trunk or stem is that part of the vine between the roots and the branches. A cane is a matured shoot one to two years old. A shoot is a green or new growth less than one year old. An arm is a matured cane two or more years old. A branch is the portion connecting the arms with the trunk or stem and is of mature wood, usually several years old. The terms branch and arm are more or less interchangeable. tA sucker is a shoot which starts from the trunk or root below e ground. A water sprout or "bull canb" is a shoot which starts above the ground from wood older than one year. Laterals are the secondary shoots or shoots from shoots. A spur is a cane pruned to less than five buds, not counting </seg>

Where the cane has beea cut back to three or four buds, all the young shoots not needed to form the framework of the vine should be removed soon after growth starts. The remainder should be tied securely in the positions in which they are in tended to grow. If the Kniffin, Munson, Caywood, or Umbrella system of training is used, only one new shoot should be left. It should be pinched back after attaining a height at which it is desired to head the vine, in order to force out branches. Tf the fan system is to be used, the shoots are pinched back closer to the ground to encourage branching. The desired number of branches may be secured from the buds left in pruning the young vine. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">31 The third spring, the vine should consist of the trunk or stem and the canes, which are to form the framework of the vine and from which the shoots for the first crop of grapes come. (Some grapes are usually borne the second season.) Pruning the third spring should be done more to secure the desired form of the vine than for fruit, since practically all of the new wood will be fruit bearing wood. PRUNING BEARING PLANTS. Pruning after the third year consists in removing all super - fluous wood, all wood which is weakened by old age, by disease, or by insects, and in maintaining the amount, position, and vigor of fruiting wood by a proper system of renewal. The principles are essentially the same in all systems of training. Fig. 15. — An excellent trellis for a vineyard. This vineyard is on the farm of L. Bridenthal, Wymore, Nebr. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 The systems in use in the State at the present time are the fan and the two- and four-cane Kniffin, with modifications of each. There are many other systems in use in various parts of the United States, but since they are no better for this section of the country, they will not be considered. Whatever system is used, a certain amount of fruiting wood must be left each season and provisions made for furnishing new fruiting wood for the next season or for renewal. RENEWAL. ilenewal refers to the replacing of old wood by new winch fulfill the same purpose as the old. Renewal is necessary several reasons. Unless renewal is practiced, the bearing of the vine grows farther and farther away from the roots, the bunches grow smaller and smaller each succeeding sea - until finally little or no fruit is produced. The different s of the vine deteriorate with age, or may be destroyed by cts or disease. Some parts of the vine may require renewal r one year's service. Therefore, the successful vineyardist t be on the alert and replace old wood by new whenever neces - to maintain the health and vigor of his vines. e'a iit-s for fruit bearing must be renewed every season. When of the various spur systems of training are used, i. e., where fruiting canes are cut back to five buds or less, the renewal simple matter, since the fruiting canes of the season hcfon cut back to a certain number of buds and thinned out until required number of buds are left to each vine. The buds on e short spurs produce the shoots which will bear the fruit the next season's crop and which must in turn be cut back, so on with each succeeding season's growth. This annual addition of spur growth of varying lengths causes the branches to become long and crooked. Hence, it often becomes necessary to renew the entire branch after a few years. This is done by selecting one of the most vigorous shoots which arises close to its base and cutting it back to a few buds, remov - ing the branch in question entirely. Should it be desired to renew the entire arm it may be done by selecting a good, strong cane growing from a bud near the base of the arm. The cane should be cut back to the desired length and tied in position after the arm has been removed. The first crop may be slightly below normal, but if a good cane is selected it should yield practi B stems requiring long renewal canes make it much more lit to secure the proper wood.

The latter method is the more desirable, since canes in the former case have usually borne fruit, and a considerable amount of old wood is left with the new so that the bearing wood is soon too far away from the source of supply. Where the latter system is used, at least one spur is left for each bearing cane. These spurs produce shoots, which form the fruiting wood for the next season to replace the canes which are bearing fruit this season and which are removed in pruning.

            <seg id="p034">34 Pruning Trees, Vines, and Shrubs. THE FAN SYSTEM. Ees trained to the fan system are renewed annually close ground. From three to five canes should be left each year i equal or greater number of spurs. The canes are tied trellis in such a manner as to give the vine a fan-shaped ance. This system has the following advantages : ( 1 ) The young shoots need little tying. 1 2) The vines can easily be laid down in case it is desired to cover them for winter. (3) MoBt of the old wood is removed each year. However, this system has some disadvantages — the fruit is borne too low, and the foliage is so dense at the center of the plant that not enough light and air are admitted. Ellis system is often so greatly modified that it is almost im ible to recognize it. Sometimes several different stems are ved to grow and are headed between the wires. Sometimes ong renewal and sometimes spurs are used for fruit bearing. THE FOUR-ARM KNIFFIN SYSTEM. According to this system two canes for fruit bearing and two spurs for renewal purposes are left at the first trellis wire about SO inches from the ground. The same number of each are left at the top wire or about 55 to 60 inches above the ground. The canes are tied to the wires on either side of the vine, and the fruiting shoots are allowed to hang down. Many growers allow these canes to remain and form arms and branches from which the bearing wood is produced. In many cases a four-arm horizontal spur system is developed, but in the majority of cases there is a compromise, and both canes and spurs are used for fruit bearing. The long renewal Kniffin is especially adapted to strong grow - ing varieties. Vines trained according to this system are easily and quickly pruned and do not require much attention during the growing season. If the spur system is allowed to creep in, more labor is required in pruning, but the fruit is often more evenly BkHficatious of the two-arm Kniffin, Caywood, Munson, and ella systems are used to a limited extent, but none of systems have proved satisfactory in this section, largely on it of birds which seek the shade and protection offered by erhanging vines, while devouring the fruit. </seg>

If the fruiting habit of the plant is not known, it is well to delay the pruning until the fruit buds appear in order to determine how much wood to leave. PRUNING BLACKBERRIES. The first year the young plants are allowed to grow without pruning. The second season, however, the new canes which come up from the roots should be pinched or cut off as soon as they attain a height of 3 to %y z feet. This will cause them to form branches which are necessary for the production of heavy crops, since few berries are borne on the main stem. Later, these lateral branches may be pinched back to cause the forma - tion of sublaterals for the same purpose. After the crop has been </seg>

Five to seven good, strong new canes should be left to fruit the next year and all the others removed with the old ones E': where the canes are covered to prevent winter injury, more should be left to provide an extra supply, should any uaged in covering. Another pruning should be given in the spring just after growth starts. At that time all broken or diseased canes and the tips of all canes and branches injured by cold or otherwise should be removed and burned. BLACK CAP ANI» PURPLE CANE RASPBERRIES P'he fruiting habits of these berries are so similar to those of blackberries that practically the same methods of pruning are adopted. The canes are usually pinched back slightly closer to the ground than is the case with blackberries, and the laterals are rarely pinched back at all during the growing season, but cut back soon after growth starts in the spring. If the canes are cut back too heavily or too late during the growing season, the laterals are liable to be poorly matured and to winterkill during the winter. During the early part of the season all suckers should be removed but not later than the first of June. Suckers for the next year's bearing canes should be selected and left, all others being cut out. Where planted in a continuous row, some form of support is often necessary to keep the canes in an upright position and from interfering with cultivation, picking, etc. A good plan is to set a line of posts of the proper height in the row and nail cross-arms, halfway up the posts and at the top. Near the outer ends of these arms, wires are stretched. The canes are kept be - tween the double rows of wires, and the laterals are allowed to hang over and are supported by them. DEWBERRIES AND OTHER VINY GROWERS. The vine producing berries, such aR dewberries, loganberries, and evergreen blackberries, require a different method of prun - ing. Instead of pinching back the runners, four or five should be selected and encouraged to grow long and form as few lat - erals as possible. Late in the winter, the canes are cut back to one-half or two-thirds of their original length. These vine pro - ducing fruits do better if trained on a trellis of some sort. A trellis similar to the one used for raspberries is very satisfactory. The young growing canes are trained on the top wires while the </seg>

The red raspberries differ from the other raspberries and from blackberries in that the fruit is borne all up and down the main stem. Consequently, it is unnecessary to force laterals. Where laterals are produced by nipping back the canes, they usually suc - cumb to our cold winters; and where the plants are covered, as it is almost always necessary to do here, the laterals are almost sure to be destroyed in the process of covering and uncovering. It is often necessary to prune back the ends of the canes in the spring just after growth starts, unless they are supported by trelliMB. CURRANTS AND GOOSEBERRIES. The largest amount and the best fruit of the currants and gooseberries is produced on two- and three-year-old wood near the base of the shoots. Altho older wood may bear as many ber - ries, the size of the individual berry is much smaller, and it is best to remove wood more than four years old. The process of pruning these fruits is one of gradual renewal. Five to eight main stems should be allowed to develop. About one-quarter to one-third of the old wood should be removed each year and new wood be allowed to fill its place. The new shoots should be nipped back during the summer to induce branching. DISINFECTANTS AND COVERS FOR WOUNDS. Iirable disinfectants and covers for wounds are very im - : in pruning.

The most satisfactory disinfectants are carbolineum, corrosive sub - limate, or, carbolic acid, tho gasoline, kerosene, copper sulphate solution, formaldehyde, etc., may also be used. If the cover is applied immediatelj', the disinfectant may be mixed with it and one application be made to answer for both purposes. Bhere there is evidence of disease in the orchard, all pruning should be disinfected after finishing each tree, or after eut - hru any diseased limb, by dipping them into some one of the </seg>

TARS. Tare of various sources are often used as coverings for tree wounds. Coal tar, which is a by-product of coal oil refineries, contains gasoline or naphtha, or both. These may harm the tree by being absorbed, thus injuring the cambium. The writer doubts whether this supposed injury is serious enough to receive consideration. Tar has the advantage, on the other hand, of being Gas tar is the residue from the manufacture of gas.

It may do some injury to the cambium of the trees. No injury, however, has l»een noted in our Station orchard. The greatest disadvantage has been that the tar beiag absorbed allows the wood to check, which is of course very undesirable. Pine tar is also absorl&gt;ed by the wood and allows serious cheeking.

The hot asphaltum is applied by means of an old brush or swab and smoothed with a piece of hot iron either Hat or curved according to the surface of the wound. Bbis solid asphaltum makes a good, cheap cover, but it is to apply on account of having to be heated. Then, there is danger of cracking during the winter months where it is on large wounds, unless carefully applied. If the work is done it make a very efficient cover. LIQUID ASPHALTUM. Biquid asplialuiiii is solid asphaltum dissolved by mixing it &gt; hot with some substance such as gasoline or naphtha, when lembles coal tar very closely. There are, however, the same tions advanced against its use as against coal tar. The use get able oils as solvents has been recommended to overcome objections, but these oils make the product more expensive, forms of liquid asphaltum have been used at the Nebraska iriment Station with good results. A solvent called Varmolciic is offered for making liquid as - phaltum. To make liquid asphaltum by using gasoline, naphtha, or Varmolene the asphaltum is melted, then withdrawn from the fire, and stirred while the solvent is added. The amount of sol - vent to use will depend upon the melting point of the asphaltum and the desired consistency of the mixture. For winter use when the asphaltum has a melting point of 285° F., 2y z parts of oil may be used to 1 part of asphaltnni. In summer the propor - tion should be about 2 to 1. Vegetable oils may be employed as solvents, in which case slightly less oil is used. When the solvents are added to hot asphaltum. there is some danger of explosion if near the fire. Liquid asphaltum has, as a rule, given lx-tter results than the solid. This is probably due to the fact that a better job of cover - ing may be done. No ill effects have been noted from the use of any of the preparations of liquid asphaltum. ORCHARD SANITATION. Ei orcharding, as in any business where plant or animal life asset, sanitary methods must he employed to secure the best ts.

Decaying stumps of limbs should be removed. The decayed wood which extends into the trunk should be taken out and the hole plugged with a block of wood or with Portland cement, after tiving first been thoroly disinfected. The entire surface should en be covered. Kreating hollows in the trunk or large limbs, all the decayed lould be removed, the wound disinfected, and cavity filled, bly with cement. After these operations it is well to lie whole surface. In the case of large cavities, it may be put in the cement in sections to prevent cracking by i in temperature. kAll prunings, decayed wood, bark, etc., should be removed m the neighborhood of the trees and be burned to prevent the ttering of diseases to adjacent trees. L These measures of sanitation apply equally as well to street d shade trees as to fruit trees. PRUNING TOOLS. It is impossible to prune satisfactorily without the proper tools. The kind and number of tools will vary, of course, with the kind and size of the plants to be pruned. However, every orchardist should have at least the following tools: A saw with a swivel blade should be used (fig. 22, c and fig. n, c), for pruning in close places where a broad bladed saw could not be used and for small limbs, and one 5-point solid blade saw ( tig. 22, b or 23, d) should be used for removing large limbs. Saws like fig. 22, a, with double cutting edges, should never be per - mitted in an orchard. More harm than good is done by employing such tools. 1 A pair of pruning shears as shown in fig. 22, / is a great help in pruning young trees, and is absolutely necessary for pruning grapes, currants, gooseberries, etc. B larger pair of shears as shown in fig. 22, e or 24, b, tho not utely necessary, is a good addition to the list, especially if is any object. A good pole pruner (fig. 22, g) is very useful in heading back side branches that are out of reach from the ground. No orchard - ist should he without a good knife.
