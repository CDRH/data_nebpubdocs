            <seg id="p002">SUMMARY 1. The average yield of 3 early varieties of oats was 8.7 bushels, or 19 per cent higher than that of 4 late varieties during an 18-year period. 2. A 6-year test of 35 varieties and strains of oats secured from various Experiment Stations and the U. S. Department of Agriculture resulted in the following average yields in bushels per acre for the 7 highest yielding: Burt C. I. No. 293 from the U. S. Dept. of Agr., 50.8 ; Burt Early White X Sixty Day from the Cornell Experiment Sta - tion, 50.7; Nebraska Kherson No. 21, 50.6; Nebraska Kherson No. 5, 50.3; Nebraska Kherson No. 23, 50.3; June, Nebraska, 49.9; Texas Red, Nebraska, 49.8. 3. Planting mixtures of varieties or pure strains of oats proved to be a less desirable practice than growing the best ones pure. During 10 years a mixture of 4 early varieties yielded the same as the average of the 4 varieties grown separately. A mixture of 5 late varieties yield - ed 1.8 per cent higher than the average when grown separately. Dur - ing 6 years, a mixture of 7 pure strains of Kherson oats prepared an - nually yielded 0.3 per cent more per acre than the average of the 7 strains grown pure. A similar mixture prepared in 1917 and grown since without further change yielded 0.8 per cent less than the average of the strains grown pure. The superiority of the best varieties or strains entering these mixtures has ranged from 1.8 to 4.8 bushels per acre more than mixtures. 4. Continuous selections of the heaviest one-fourth seed from Kherson oats by means of wind blast gravity separation resulted in an 18 - year average increase in yield of 0.5 bushel per acre over the original ungraded seed. The average yield from a similar separation of the lightest one-fourth seed was 0.4 bushel less than the original. Prac - tically no difference was found in the response of the ordinary mass variety of Kherson oats and a pure strain of Kherson (Nebr. No. 21) to fanning mill grading. During 6 years the heaviest one-fourth, largest one-fourth, lightest one-fourth, and smallest one-fourth Kherson seed yielded 99.7, 99.5, 97.0 and 98.0 per cent respectively of the orig - inal ungraded Kherson. The same grades of Nebraska No. 2 1 oats yielded 101.3, 96.2, 98.0 and 96.7 per cent of the ungraded Nebraska No. 21 oats seed. 5. Nursery plantings of hand-selected small seed of Kherson oats yielded a 12-year average of 6.2 per cent less than hand-selected large seed where equal numbers of each grade were planted at a normal rate for the large seed. Planted in equal weights, the original unselected and the small seed yielded respectively 0.7 and 1.2 per cent less than the large. 6. Large and small seeds (extreme grades) of Kherson and Nebraska No. 21 oats and Java spring wheat were space-planted to permit maxi - mum individual plant development. The small seed consistently pro - duced slightly shorter and later ripening plants with fewer heads and </seg>

Small seed of the Kher - son, Nebraska No. 21, and Java Spring wheat yielded respectively 82, 75, and 82 per cent as much per plant as large seed of the same va - rieties. 7. Early (March 31), medium (April 12), and late (April 20) seeded Kherson oats yielded respectively 58.2, 49.4, and 38.0 bushels per acre during a 7-year period. The later plantings resulted in shorter straw, later heading and ripening, and poorer quality of grain. 8. In a 10-year test Kherson oats planted at the rates of 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 pecks per acre, gave the respective yields of 51.5, 54.0, 55.9, 56.2, 55.9, and 55.4 bushels per acre. The corresponding net returns obtained by subtracting the amount of seed planted from the grain harvested were 50.1, 52.0, 53.4, 53.2, 52.4, and 51.4 bushels per acre. In a similar 10-year test with the larger seeded variety, Swedish Select, net returns from 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 pecks per acre were 36.1, 41.6, 42.8, 43.7, 42.8, and 42.1 bushels per acre. 9. A 5-year average shows one bushel per acre in favor of drilling over broadcasting oats, while drilling oats at the North Platte Sub - station yielded 6.5 bushels per acre more than broadcasting. 10. Kherson oats harvested during 3 years when ripe and 2, 4, and 6 days before ripe yielded respectively 57.0, 57.5, and 52.8, and 51.1 bushels per acre. Harvesting oats slightly green, not to exceed two days before ripe, is a satisfactory practice. 11. In a 7-year nursery test of 24 lots of spring wheat seed from various sources, the common varieties yielded as follows: An unidenti - fied variety from Kearney County, Nebraska 14.9 bu., Marquis 12.7 bu., Java 12.5 bu., Preston 12.1 bu., Mammoth Pearl 11.8 bu., Palisade 11.2 bu., Ghirka 10.9 bu., Glyndon 9.3 bu., Red Fife 9.1 bu., Bluestem 6.4 bu. Two durum wheats, Arnautka and Kubanka, yielded respectively 14.9 and 12.8 bushels per acre. 12. An 8-year average from field plats shows yields of 16.1 bushels for Marquis and 15.9 bushels as an average for 6 Java spring wheats received from different sources under the names of Scotch Fife, Swed - ish, Red Spring, Velvet Chaff, and Early Java. A new group of spring wheats received in 1921 and compared in field plats with the Marquis and Java show 3-year average yields as follows: Marquis, 13.4; Java, 13.0; Norka, 11.2; Kota, 10.8; Red Bobs, 10.6; and Prelude, 9.6 bushels per acre. Marquis grown by the Station since 1910 yielded, in a 3-year aver - age, 0.1 bushel more than Marquis from seed received each year from northern states. In the 8-year field plat average, and in the 7-year nursery average the Javas from 6 sources varied in yield 1.3 and 1.2 bushels respectively. These tests, together with results secured from oats, show that the source of seed of a given variety or strain of a self - fertilized crop does not materially influence yield. 13.

Spring wheat planted early (March 31), medium (April 12) and late (April 20) made 7-year average yields of 15.8, 12.1, and 9.0 bushels per acre respectively. 15. In a 4-year test of barley, 10 six-rowed bearded, 5 two-rowed bearded, and 4 six-rowed beardless varieties made average yields of 30.2, 29.2 and 22.2 bushels per acre respectively. Club Mariout barley was the highest yielding variety of the test. 16. Yields of oats and barley compared in pounds of hull-free grain per acre were 1098 and 1363 pounds respectively during 11 years whereas the yield in bushels per acre of grain with hull was 49.0 and 33.4 bushels respectively. 17. Four-year average yields of various small grain crops in pounds of hull-free grain per acre are as follows: winter wheat, 1638; winter rye, 1568; barley, 1212; spring rye, 1165; oats, 1095; spring emmer (Khapli) 977; spring wheat, 906; spring emmer (common) 817; hull - less barley, 816. 18. General recommendations regarding cultural practices with these small grain crops are included. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Spring Small Grains T. A. KIESSELBACH AND W. E. LYNESS Oats, barley, and spring wheat constitute the important spring sown small grain crops grown in Nebraska. The com - bined acreage of these crops in 1922 was 2,885,501 acres, and consisted of 2,408,133 acres of oats, 235,109 acres of spring wheat, and 242,259 acres of barley. Altho not any of these crops rank with corn and winter wheat in this state, still even barley and spring wheat are of special importance in some regions as shown comparatively by Figs. 1 to 4.

These crops fill an important place in the crop rotation by facilitating the change from corn to winter wheat under con - ditions where this change cannot advantageously be made directly. The wheat grown in Nebraska 30 years ago was almost entirely of the spring type, but was then rapidly superseded by Turkey Red winter wheat, which had recently been intro - duced. The production of spring wheat is now limited pri - marily to some areas of the western and northern parts of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Spring Small Grains 7 Barley is grown most extensively in south central and western Nebraska. It is grown in a limited way in all parts of the state, largely for hog feed, and appears to merit more extensive production. Oats are largely prized as a horse feed by farmers thru - out the state, and the relatively high feeding value of its straw is a further inducement for its production. This bulletin reports the results obtained at the Nebraska Experiment Station from variety tests, seed selection prac - tices, and cultural treatments of these crops. The majority of the tests have been made on one-thirtieth acre plats, sys- FiG. 5. — Manner of comparing oats varieties for yield in thirtieth-acre field plats. Varieties are commonly replicated 3 or more times in different parts of the field, and yields are based on the plat aver - ages. tematically replicated one or more times. For those tests which were made in the small grain nursery, plats containing 3 to 5 drill rows 16 feet in length were replicated 7 to 10 times. Check plats have commonly been inserted every sixth plat Comparative yields have been determined by averaging the yields of replicate plats. Except where the nature of the ex - periment required otherwise, the rate and manner of seeding conformed with good farm practice in the locality. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 201 OATS EARLY VS. LATE VARIETIES The results obtained during the last 18 years from a com - parative yield test of 3 early and 4 late varieties of oats are given in Tables 1 and 2. The early group has averaged 8.7 bushels, or 19 per cent more than the late group. This differ - ence in yield has been accompanied by differences of 4 inches in plant height, 7 days in the time of ripening, and 3 per cent in proportion of hull to grain. The late varieties are commonly at a distinct disadvantage here because of increasing danger to the crop from heat, drought, and rust as the season advances. When grown under the more favorable climate of the northern states and Canada, the late varieties yield relatively better and have a very at - tractive large, plump, heavy grain. Nebraska farmers should not secure seed of these northern grown late sorts, because of their poor adaptation to our conditions. Late oats will do well here in occasional years, but are less dependable than the early varieties. At the North Platte substation (Nebr. Sta. Bulletin No. 193), Swedish Select, a standard late variety, averaged only 56 per cent as much as Kherson oats during a 13-year period. COMPARISON OF HIGH YIELDING VARIETIES In the spring of 1916 seed was obtained from the Experi - ment Stations of 11 other states. These Stations were re - quested to supply one or more of the most productive early varieties which they had been able to produce thru breeding, or had obtained from other sources. It was the purpose to compare the best from other states with the best strains de - veloped at the Nebraska Experiment Station, and with other Nebraska grown varieties. This test of 35 varieties and strains probably includes the best oats available for Nebraska conditions. The complete collection of 35 varieties has been tested thruout a 6-year period, 1916-1922, in thirtieth-acre plats replicated 3 or more times annually. The results are recorded in Tables 3 and 4. The highest average yield secured for the 6-year period was 50.8 bushels from Burt (C. I. No. 293) obtained from Amarillo, Texas. Nearest competitors were: Burt Early White by Sixty Day, a hybrid from Ithaca, New York, 50.7 bushels ; Nebraska Kherson No. 21, 50.6 bushels ; Nebraska Kherson No. 5, 50.3 bushels; Nebraska Kherson No. 23, 50.3 </seg>

Table 6 shows yields for 10 years of 4 early and 5 late varieties in comparison with the yields of mixtures of each group prepared annually and containing an equal quantity of seed of each variety. For the early group the average yield of the varieties grown separately is the same as that of the mixture during the 10 - year period ; and the mixture of the late varieties yielded 1.8 per cent higher than the average when grown separately. In a similar test (Table 7) with 7 pure Kherson strains during a 6-year period, a mixture of seed prepared annually yielded 0.3 per cent more per acre than the average of the 7 strains. A mixture of these strains prepared in 1917 and grown continuously since then without further admixture has yielded 0.8 per cent less than the average for the strains grown separately. It is apparent that the most productive individual variety or strain is superior to a mixture. In these tests such supe - riority has ranged from 1.8 bushels to 4.8 bushels per acre. These results indicate no practical advantage for mixing varieties or strains. EFFECT OF GRADING UPON SEED VALUE Eighteen Years Test with Kherson Oats. — Light and heavy seed of Kherson oats have been compared annually for yield with the ordinary ungraded seed during the last 18 years. The separation into light and heavy grades is made by direct - ing the seed into an upward moving air blast. The lighter seed is blown upward and away from the machine thru a cloth conductor, while the heavier seed falls into a container below. For each grade the operation is repeated until one - fourth of the original quantity is obtained for planting. Dur - ing the period, 1908-1916, each grade was continuously taken from the crop grown the previous year from the same grade. Ordinary unselected Kherson oats was used in 1917, and the grading from it has been continuous since. Thus there has been opportunity for an accumulative effect in part. These 2 grades together with the original unselected seed have been tested each year, in duplicate field plats, one-thirtieth to one - fifteenth acre in size, and were seeded with a press drill at the rate of 10 pecks per acre. As an average for the 18 years (Table 8) the heavy seed surpassed the light seed 0.9 bushel </seg>

There was little difference in the quality of the crop harvested, the test weight per bushel of grain from the heavy seed being 0.6 and 0.8 pound greater than for the crop from the ungraded and light seed respectively. Comparative Effects of Grading upon a Pure Strain and upon Ordinary Kherson Oats. — It was thought of interest to determine the relative effects of continuous grading upon an ordinary commercial variety, and upon a pure line selection from the same variety. An experiment was begun in 1917 in which 2 methods of grading have been tested for each of these 2 types of oats. By one method the previously cleaned seed is separated by gravity thru the use of an air blast as pre - viously described. In the other method, the large and small seeds are separated with screens in an ordinary fanning mill. By these 2 methods of separation, the heaviest one-fourth, largest one-fourth, lightest one-fourth, and smallest one - fourth seed were obtained each year for testing in duplicate thirtieth-acre plats.

In this test an ordinary productive mass variety consisting of a natural mixture of many strains was no more affected by grading than was a single pure line strain. It may be concluded from all of these tests that the fanning mill in no way serves as a grain breeder and that its practical use in seed preparation is primarily limited to the removal of trash, weed seeds, and fine inert material. 1 uite Gradet (1) iriginal ungraded Heaviest one-fourth ..ightest one-fourth -argest one-fourth . smallest one-fourth &gt;riginal ungraded Jeaviest one-fourth lightest one-fourth Largest oTie-fo:irth . .

            <seg id="p021">Spring Small Grains 21 Equal Weights vs. Equal Numbers of Large and Small Oats Seed. — Large and small hand selected seed of Kherson oats have been compared for yield during the 12 years, 1912 to 1923 (Table 10). These 2 grades differed markedly in kernel size; the individual weight of the small seed averaging only 58 per cent of the large seed. The large seed was planted at approximately the normal planting rate for this region, averaging about 10 pecks per acre. The small seed was com - pared with the large by planting both in equal numbers and in equal weights of seed per acre. The original unselected seed was included in the test by planting in equal weights with the large during the first 5 years and also equal numbers thereafter. This test was repeated systematically 10 times in nursery plats. Except for the use of single rows in 1912 and 1913, the test has been made in 3-row blocks with the rows spaced 10 inches apart. The yields were determined from the center rows. Small seed yielded 6.2 per cent less than large seed when compared in equal numbers, while the yield was only 1.2 per cent less when equal weights of seed were sown per acre. The yield from hand selected large seed exceeded that of the original unselected seed by 0.3 bushel when equal weights of seed were sown per acre. Planting equal weights of the different grades corresponds more nearly to what would occur in farm practice than does planting equal numbers. Effect of Size of Seed Upon Size of Plant. — Since the pre - ceding investigations had indicated that very small seed were at a greater disadvantage than large seed when com - pared in equal numbers than when equal weights are sown, the following test (Table 11) was made to supply a possible explanation. Two extreme grades of seed, large and small, were hand picked from each of the 3 varieties : Kherson oats, Nebraska No. 21 oats, and Java spring wheat. These were space-planted 5 inches apart in rows 8 inches apart, per - mitting maximum individual plant development. Upward of 350 plants from each seed grade were studied each year in detail. The small seed consistently produced slightly shorter and later ripening plants with fewer heads and lower grain yield per plant. As an average for the oats grown during the four years, the small seed produced 11.4 per cent fewer heads and 21.2 per cent lower grain yield per plant than the large seed. By having a larger number of plants per acre as in the case of planting equal weights of seed previously discussed, </seg>

RATES OF PLANTING OATS Rate-planting tests with oats have been made in field plats since 1903. Since the various rates have not all been tested thruout the entire period, the results have been grouped in a number of tables (Tables 13-16) according to the number of rates that have been included for the various periods. In the 18-year comparison of 8 and 16 pecks of Kherson seed oats per acre (Table 13), the 16-peck rate gave an average annual yield of 0.8 bushel more than the 8 pecks ; but the net return was 1.2 bushels less. By net return is meant the yield per acre less the amount of seed planted. During the 15-year period (Table 14), seeding 8 and 16 pecks per acre has yielded respectively 4.0 and 5.8 bushels per acre more than the 4-peck rate, while the respective net returns have been 3.0 and 2.8 bushels greater. In the 14-year comparison of 8, 10, 12, and 16 pecks per acre (Table 15) the respective net returns were 55.7, 55.4, 55.5, and 54.5 bushels. </seg>

            <seg id="p026">26 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 201 In a 10-year test (1913-1923) with Kherson oats (Table 16), planting rates of 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 pecks of seed per acre gave respective yields of 51.1, 54.0, 55.9, 56.2, 55.9, and 55.4 bushels per acre. The corresponding net returns were 50.1, 52.0, 53.4, 53.2, 52.4, and 51.4 bushels per acre. In a similar test during these 10 years with Swedish Select oats, a later and larger seeded variety, the seeding rates of 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 pecks per acre yielded respec - tively 37.1, 43.6, 45.3, 46.7, 46.3, and 46.1 bushels per acre. The corresponding net returns were 36.1, 41.6, 42.8, 43.7, 42.8, and 42.1 bushels per acre. During the last 6 years the additional rate of 6 pecks pet - acre has been included, giving a net yield within one bushel of that obtained from 8 pecks per acre for both varieties. As would be expected, the data show slightly shorter growth and earlier maturity for the thicker planting rates in the case of both varieties. The quality of the grain is about the same for the various rates. All the data suggest that there may be a rather wide range, from 2.0 to 3.5 bushels per acre, in the rate of planting oats, without causing a very material effect upon the net return per acre. The most practical rates of seeding for Kherson oats would seem to be 8 to 10 pecks and for Swedish Select 10 to 12 pecks per acre. A thin rate permits too much weed growth on foul soil. It is desirable to reduce the rate with an approach toward central and western Nebraska because of lower rainfall. During 15 years, 1907-1921, rate of planting tests at the North Platte Substation gave yields of 24.6, 29.6, 33.5, ahd 31.9 bushels per acre for the respective planting rates of 2, 4, 6, and 8 pecks per acre. </seg>

EFFECT OF HARVESTING OATS BEFORE RIPE It is well recognized that oats straw has a special feeding value for livestock, and it is a general belief among farmers that its value is further enhanced by cutting the oats while still slightly green.

During the 3-year period, 1921-1923, Kherson oats were harvested at 4 different stages of maturity, viz., 6, 4, and 2 days before ripe and when ripe (Table 18). The average yield per acre for each cutting date was 51.1, 52.8, 57.5, and 57.0 bushels respectively. The oats were considered mature when three-fourths of the heads appeared fully ripe. It would seem good practice to harvest oats on the slightly green order, not to exceed 2 days before ripe. Yields were reduced 7.4 and 10.4 per cent by harvesting 4 and 6 days before maturity. SPRING WHEAT Spring wheat, altho a poorly adapted crop thruout the larger part of this state, is being grown as a standard crop in parts of western and northern Nebraska, and besides is often used as an emergency crop to meet special requirements in other parts of the state. The following data concerning the relative merit of varieties, the source of seed, the effect of the time of planting, and of the grading of the seed upon the crop may be of interest on special occasions to communities as well as to individual farmers. VARIETIES AND SEED SOURCES OF SPRING WHEAT Nursery Test. — Twenty-four different lots of seed, repre - senting 10 varieties of common spring wheat and 2 varieties of durum, have been tested at the Nebraska Experiment Sta - tion for periods of 7 and 12 years. The annual yields together with 7-year and 12-year averages are shown in Table 19. A description of the varieties is given in Table 20. These tests have been made in 5-row nursery blocks, 16 feet in length, replicated 5 to 7 times annually. The border rows were dis - carded in the yield determinations to eliminate the effect of plat competition. All varieties were planted at the rate of 6 pecks per acre. In summarizing the result of this test the average yield for each variety will be taken altho it was represented by seed secured from various sources. An un - identified wheat obtained from Kearney County, Nebraska, ranked first for the 7-year period, with an average yield of 14.9 bushels per acre. The average yields per acre of the other varieties in this test were: Marquis, 12.7; Java, 12.5; Preston (Velvet Chaff), 12.1; Mammoth Pearl, 11.8; Palisade, 11.2; Ghirka, 10.9; Glyndon, 9.3; Red Fife, 9.1; and Blue - stem, 6.4 bushels per acre. Compared with these common spring wheat yields, 2 varieties of durum (Arnautka and Ku - banka) yielded 14.9 and 12.8 bushels respectively. </seg>

D. A. Bulletin 1074 (Clark, Martin, and Ball) were identified as Java. Altho the high yielding unindentified Kearney County variety closely resembles Java, its consistent earlier ripening and higher yields indicate that it may be a different wheat. It would seem to merit an increase in seed supply. Of the commercially available va - rieties, Marquis and Java may be regarded as the most de - sirable since they are high yielders of superior milling and baking quality. Java sometimes shatters a little in harvest - ing. Altho the Bluestem and Fife varieties were formerly grown extensively in this state, they have proved too late maturing and therefore more subject to rust and heat dam - age than earlier varieties, such as Marquis, Java, and Preston, which have largely replaced them. The late varieties yield relatively much better in the cooler climates of the northern states and Canada than they do here. On the other hand, the data in Table 18 suggest that it makes little difference where the seed was grown provided that it is of the variety or strain desired. This agrees with the results secured for oats, and suggests a principle regarding the stability of self-fer- Fig. 10. — Manner of testing spring wheat varieties in field plats.

Two durum varieties, Monad and Acme, yielded 16.9 and 16.6 bushels respectively. These 2 durum varieties are outstanding in yield, but we are advised by the U. S.

These 3 groups averaged 30.2, 29.2, and 22.2 bushels per acre. While this test has not been of sufficient duration to permit final con - clusion regarding relative grain yields, yet it is very clearly indicated that the beardless varieties are distinctly inferior, yielding 25 per cent less than the other 2 groups in this test.

As an average for 4 years, 1920 - 1923, Oderbrucker six-rowed bearded barley, shown at right, yielded 32.0 bushels per acre compared with 24.1 bushels for six-rowed beardless, shown at left. Club Mariout from California and Oderbrucker No. 2121 from North Dakota yielded 6.1 and 4.2 bushels more per acre respectively than Nebraska grown Common six-row barley.

This quality would make the han - dling of barley at harvest less disagreeable and would add greatly to the value of its straw. BARLEY AND OAT YIELDS COMPARED Table 26 shows a comparison of the yields of Kherson oats, and six-rowed bearded barley, obtained by the Experiment Station, for 11 years. Calculated in bushels per acre the bar - ley in this test yielded only 68 per cent as high as the oats; Table 26. — Comparative yield of Kherso-n oats and Manchurian* convert yield* from bushels to pounds. {Weights without hull were calculated from the avenge hull percentages of 30 for oaU and 15 for barley. but the yield of barley in pounds per acre is slightly above that of oats. When it is taken into consideration that approxi - mately 15 per cent of the weight of barley is hull compared with 30 per cent for oats, the superiority of the yield of barley becomes more apparent.

            <seg id="p042">42 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 201 COMPARATIVE YIELDS OF VARIOUS SMALL GRAIN CROPS A 4-year comparison in nursery blocks of various small grain crops, replicated 5 times, is shown in Table 27. Oats show the highest yield in bushels per acre ; but, on the compar - able basis of pounds per acre, winter wheat and winter rye yielded higher than oats. Since some of the grains are reg - ularly threshed free of the chaff or hull, and others vary in the per cent of hull left adhering to the kernel, a fairer com - parison of the grain yield of the different crops is in pounds per acre of hull-free grain. This lowers the yield of oats, wheat, remains largely enclosed in its hull. By volume the per cent of hull is very high, but because of the heavier kernel of emmer the per cent of hull by weight is less than that with oats. Winter wheat and winter rye yield higher than their spring types. The comparative yields of these crops are shown graphically in Fig. 13. GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CULTURE OF OATS, BARLEY, AND SPRING WHEAT Soil. — These crops respond favorably to a reasonably high state of soil fertility. This condition is best maintained thru the practice of crop rotation including clovers and alfalfa, and by occasional light applications of barnyard manure.

            <seg id="p043">Spring Small Grains 43 early varieties best withstand lodging on extremely fertile soil. The Seed Bed. — Thoroly disked cornstalk land provides the most practical seed bed for these crops. The yields from such preparation are often slightly lower than when the land is plowed, but the lower production cost tends to increase the net profit. Where a large acreage is to be seeded, disking facilitates seed bed preparation and early seeding. In the case of weedy fields, spring plowing at a depth of 4 to 5 inches is desirable. LsjenJ—O'Hull fret from, Fig. 13. — Comparative grain yields of 8 different crops in pounds per acre at the Nebraska Experiment Station during the 4-year period, 1920-23. The yields for barley, oats, and emmer are given for both hulled and hull-free grain. Time of Seeding. — The order of spring frost resistance of these 3 crops is spring wheat, oats, and barley. This is, therefore, the best sequence of planting. Seeding between March 15 and April 1 is recommended for the eastern half of the state. The spring season sometimes begins somewhat later farther west, and seeding may be proportionately de - layed. Rate of Seeding. — For eastern Nebraska, recommended rates of planting per acre are 8 to 10 pecks for oats, 6 pecks </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 201 for spring wheat, and 8 to 10 pecks for barley. For the central and western parts of the state, best results are ob - tained from the lighter seeding rates of 6 pecks for oats, 4 pecks for spring wheat, and 6 to 8 pecks for barley. The reduction in rate of seeding should be gradual from the east - ern toward the western part of the state, due primarily to a gradual reduction in rainfall. Manner of Seeding. — Little difference in yield has been found between broadcasting and drilling oats by the Experi - ment Station at Lincoln; while at North Platte (Bui. 193) broadcasting was found to yield 30 per cent less than drilling for barley, 24 per cent less for spring wheat, and 20 per cent less for oats. Under favorable seed bed and moisture con - ditions broadcasting and drilling may yield equally well whereas drilling becomes more advantageous under unfavor - able conditions. Slightly more seed per acre should be sown when broadcasting. Choice of Varieties. — Early maturing varieties are recom - mended for Nebraska, tho the medium early varieties do rel - atively well in the northern part of the state. Nebraska No. 21 and Burt oats are the best early varieties available in quantity within the state. Marquis and Java spring wheats are the most productive common varieties com - mercially available for this state. Prelude is a newly in - troduced early variety which may have special value for seed - ing in partly winterkilled wheat fields, since it ripens at about the same time as the hard winter wheats. In eastern Ne - braska it yields less than Marquis but appears equally good in western Nebraska. The use of durum wheats should be con - fined to parts of western Nebraska where their superiority has been demonstrated. The bearded barley varieties yield much higher than the beardless varieties. Common Six-Row, Oderbrucker and Manchurian are among the best available in quantity. The source of seed is not a vital factor in the yield of self - fertilized small grain crops provided the correct variety or strain is used. Long continued culture in the same locality does not cause these grains to "run out." Preparation of Seed. — Whenever a good quality of grain is obtained from the threshing machine free of noxious weed seeds or trash, fanning or grading is not regarded as import - ant in preparation for seeding. Use of an established treat - ment for smut is always desirable, and especially when smut is known to have been present in the preceding crop. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">Spring Small Grains 45 Harvesting. — Small grain may be harvested with a binder just before the kernels become hard with no reduction in yield and at this stage there is little loss from shattering. The feed - ing quality of oats straw is somewhat improved by harvesting on the slightly green order. If any of these small grain crops are harvested more than 2 days before ripe the grain yield may be materially reduced. (SM) </seg>
