            <seg id="p003">3 j FOREWORD The Board of Control of Nebraska herewith transmits its Seventh Biennial Report of the seventeen institutions under its jurisdiction, for the period beginning July 1, 1925, and ending June 30, 1927. The term of A. E. Allyn expired June 30, 1925, and Mr. E. T. Westervelt of Scottsbluff was appointed by the Governor to fill the vacancy; During the period covered by this report changes have taken place in the management of two of our institutions. The death of Dr. W., S. Fast, Superintendent of the Hastings State Hospital at Ingleside, caused a vacancy which was filled by the appointment of Dr. George M. White to the superintendency of this institution. Prior to his advancement, Dr. White had held the position of Assistant Superintendent of this hospital. Our Secretary, Mr. E. B. Fairfield, who passed away on June 12, 1927, is sadly missed, he having been connected with the Board in this capacity for the past eight years. At the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children the resignation of Miss Lena Driever, Superintendent, caused a vacancy which was filled by the appointment of Mrs. Margaret E. Hay, formerly Matron of the Lincoln State Hospital. Some permanent improvements have been made, the more out - standing of which follow : Soldiers and [Sailors' Home, Burkett $ 5,000.00 Hastings State Hospital, Ingleside 125,000.00 State Industrial School, Kearney 5,000.00 Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln 110,000.00 State Penitentiary, Lincoln 30,000.00 Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk .._ 100,000.00 School for the Deaf, Omaha 7,500.00 Reformatory for Women, York 50,000.00 Reformatory for Men, Lincoln 48,000.00 During this biennium the Home for Dependent Children was moved to a new location. A small acreage, new cottages and equip - </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 merit were purchased at a cost of $75,000.00. This new institution is adapting itself well to the needs of our dependent children, and the Hoard feels that it was very fortunate m securing this splendid property at so low a cost to the state. In addition to the foregoing permanent improvements, approxi - mately $100,000.00 was spent m the way of general repairs to the various institutions. A sewage disposal system was also built at the Reformatory for Men. Lincoln, at an approximate cost of $12,000.00. while at the .Yehraska Institution for Feeble-Minded at Beatrice' a ward build - ing was remodeled at a cost of $16,000.00 and extensive repairs were made on the building. One story was removed, which renders this building apparently safe. We feel grateful to the legislature for the appropriations which made it possible to make these much needed improvements. There is an outstanding crowded condition still prevailing m many of our institutions, and this can only be overcome by appropriations to meet this emergency. In the tables which follow will be shown the population of the various institutions, together with the expenditures made for the maintenance of the same. In these tables it must be borne m mind that the items of salaries and wages are included under maintenance m all instances excepting that of the Hoard itself. Capital outlay represents permanent improvements to the realty and equipment. Details of operation of the farm land owned by the state are also given m the several reports of- the superintendents, and we trust will be read with interest. We extend our sincere thanks to the officers and employees of the various institutions m their efforts to bring about a better con - dition for those who have been committed to their care. We also wish to thank (Governor McMullen for his many manifestations of interest and cooperation m our work. Hoard of Control, L. C. OBERLIES. Chairman, CARRIE A. BIRSS. E. T. WESTERVELT. </seg>

            <seg id="p017">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith submit the Twenty-first Biennial Report of the Nebraska- Institution for Feeble-Minded for the period ending June 30, 1927. . During this biennium our population has continued to increase steadily from an average m residence of 804 for the first six months of the biennium to 856 for the five months ending June 1, 1927. The death rate, on the other hand, has steadily decreased, this year's death rate being less than one-half as great as that of four years ago. We feel that this decrease is due to the added individual care given the children, m watching their weight, diet and clothing, and giving them regular dental attention. Our medical- staff has given good, faithful, systematic service and has obtained good results. During the winter an epidemic of Influenza and one of German Measles developed among the girls. We had seven cases of Diphtheria with no deaths, compared with four cases with two deaths m the preceding year. We have con - tinued to sterilize most of those leaving the institution permanently. Admittances to the institution during the last year have been fewer due to the crowded condition at the institution, and the wait - ing list has greatly increased. The greatest difficulty that we are facing at present is the shortage of water. The wells that contained nine feet of water have receded so that now they have about four feet. An additional supply of water must be located. Quite a little repair work has been, done on our oldest ward building. A new roof, dormers, some, tile floors, and the necessary plumbing incident thereto, have greatly improved the building. Other repair work done about the institution is as follow. A number of the composition roofs have been resurfaced and the remainder have been recoated with asbestos fibre paint. 17 </seg>
            <seg id="p018">Several hundred feet of sidewalk has been put in and some side - walks patched. Our hot-bed was doubled in size. The steam room of the general kitchen was replastered, and new pipes were in - stalled to carry off the steam. About thirty benches were built and put on the various wards. A new brine pump was purchased for the ice machine, and new rings and bearings were also installed. Some new boiler tubes were put in Number Two boiler. A feed gate for Number Four boiler and some repairs for the Jones Stokers were also bought. The wiring in the tunnels was worked j over, and the wiring of some of the street lights Was replaced. Two light posts were added to our outside lighting system. We have planted quite a little nursery stock, including one hundred cherry trees, twenty apple trees, twenty red raspberry bushes, one thousand everbearing strawberry plants, five hundred asparagus roots, some horse radish, twenty-four bridal wreaths and a dozen roses. We have also planted quite a little sweet clover and alfalfa besides renewing our lawns. At present our garden, farm and lawns are doing splendidly. The painter and two boys have kept constantly busy and have recently repainted the barns and outbuildings. The farm equip - ment has also been given attention, and a set of harness purchased. Some hay racks and dump boards were made, and the wagons and machinery repainted. Our school work has been going on very nicely. We have been doing more rug work and have introduced a few new things, especially the making of fibre lamp shades. We have given our regular entertainments and have had our picture shows, dances and chapel services each week as usual during the school year and now, in their stead, band concerts are being given twice a week during the summer months. Our special play, the operetta "Sylvia," was given in April of this year and was well rendered by the children. We have increased our band in size and we now have twenty - two inmate members. New uniforms have been ordered. We have purchased new music and have also added four dozen hymnals for use in the chapel. We have taken steps to beautify that section of the Evergreen I lome Cemetery set aside for the burial of institution inmates. We have replaced sixty old wooden grave markers with stone markers j 18 </seg>
            <seg id="p019">and have repainted a great number of the wooden ones. We plan to have flowers and shrubs placed on the graves. Our milk supply has been increased nearly four hundred per cent in four years. For the calendar year 1926 our/average produc - tion was nearly 30,000 pounds a month. It continues to increase and we reached our largest production of 44,346 pounds in May, 1927. The help has been steady and reliable. There were only thirteen changes made in the help during the eleven months ending June 1, 1927, and only one of this number was discharged. Good, competent help makes the work of an institution a pleasure and profit to every one concerned. I am completing my service at this institution July 1, 1927. I have enjoyed my work at Beatrice, as well as the people of Beatrice with whom it has thrown me in contact, to the fullest possible ex - tent. It is with very keen regret that I give up my work here and I shall always look back to it with pleasure. I wish to take this method of thanking every one who in any way has helped to make the institution more efficient and the lives of all, both patients and employees, more enjoyable. Respectfully submitted, L. T. SIDWELL, Superintendent. 19 </seg>

            <seg id="p033">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institution, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith submit the Seventeenth Biennial Report of the Nebraska Training School for Girls for the period ending June 30, •1927. The general conduct of the girls has been very good. The credit system is used and, as a rule, is sufficient for most girls. They not only take pride m their own records, but those of the Families' as well. Any girl who does not conduct herself as she should soon realizes that she is becoming unpopular. The girls have enjoyed good health, and we have been very fortunate m that we have had no epidemics during the past biennium. In no department of our work do we take more pride than m the academic department. We were able, during the past biennium, to add the tenth grade and sixteen girls finished this grade m May. Two of our girls who were attending high school out m the state won scholarships. One girl has worked her way through two years of University and will teach this fall. Our music has become such a vital part of the school that we feel it would be impossible to get along without it. This is the most popular department. We have been able to have plenty of good, wholesome recrea - tion at all times although we do not have a woman who can devote her time to this work. The girls have shown a great deal of ability m planning for the different special occasions. Decorating and preparing for holidays are very favorable pastimes. We have received much help through the University Extension Department and the County Farm Bureau. They have not only responded heartily to every call, but they have planned and organized a number of clubs which have been a real pleasure and help to the girls and the management of the school. 33 </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 During the summer months the County Red Cross sent out a nurse who conducted classes m home hygiene and home nursing. Twenty-six girls received diplomas for this work. The parole department is one of the most important we have. However, we have no parole officer, and it is impossible for us to look after our girls as they should be when placed on parole. We had hoped that the last Legislature would provide funds for this work, but they failed to do so. Out of our repair fund, we were able to make a number of needed repairs and build a silo. We are justly proud of the interior decoration which was done by our girls under the direction of a very efficient decorator and at a very small cost for labor. In conclusion, I wish to express my appreciation and gratitude to those who have been interested m the welfare of the school, especially to the ministers, churches, clubs, Agricultural Associa - tion, Farm Bureau, Geneva High School, County Red Cross and the management of the Sunbeam Theater. I deeply appreciate the wise counsel, sympathetic understand - ing and loyal support which I have, at all times, received at v srle hands of the Board of Control. ' Respectfully submitted, S LENA E.

            <seg id="p043">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. In submitting this report, we note that the male membership has declined 37, while the female membership has declined 1, during the biennium. This is m part due to the new Pension Law giving an increase to those who are not members of a Home, and, accord - ingly, discharges are granted that the increase might be obtained. Otherwise, our membership would not have changed much. During the time covered by this report, two irrigation plants have been placed m operation, and the results have more than justified the expenditure. Our crops were a total failure the first year of this biennium due to the fact that we were unable to irrigate. We appreciate very much the cooperation of the Governor and the Board of Control m meeting the needs of the members of this Home and desire to express our sincere thanks for the kindly consideration shown.

            <seg id="p051">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. It is with pleasure that I submit my Third Biennial Report as Commandant of the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska, which report covers the period beginning July 1, 1925, and ending June 30, 1927. During this period the general health of the members has been good, although we have had sixty-one deaths, thirty-six men and twenty-five women. For the first time m over seven years, death came to an officer when Mrs. Susan H. Raley, matron, died suddenly. Mrs. Raley was. an efficient and faithful officer and had spent several years m institutional work m different state institu - tions. The Board of Control made a wise choice m naming Mrs. Theresia Bening, of Eustice, Nebraska, as matron to fill the vacancy. Very few improvements have been made during the past biennium due to lack of funds. We did, however, convert the old ice house into a cow barn and install a new boiler with a reservoir to relieve the pressure on the wooden pipe from the Burns Well. I have no recommendations to make unless it be the purchase of forty acres of land near the Home on which could be grown vegetables, hay and corn; which would reduce living expenses and be a profitable investment Again I wish to return thanks to our Great Commander for the many blessings conferred upon the Home; to the Governor and to the Honorable Board of Control for. their interest and coopera - tion m the management of the Home; to the G. A. R., W. R. C, ladies of G. A. R., Sons of Veterans and their Auxiliary, Daughters of Veterans and all patriotic organizations for their visits and donations to the Home; to the officers and employees for their faithful performance of all duties assigned them. .

The several departments have functioned efficiently during the last two years, working m harmony and cooperation with the execu - tive office, the Board of Control, and the Governor's office. Buildings and grounds have been well tended. Repairs, except m a few major instances where funds were not available, have been made where needed, -and the- entire plant has been maintained m a manner consistent with its importance as an institution of the state of Nebraska. A new Receiving and Treatment building was constructed dur - ing the period and is now being prepared for occupancy. It is com - plete m every respect, and places the institution m line with the best modern practice. • The year of 1926 was unfavorable for the farm and garden. We produced very little. Fortunately, plans had been matured for irrigating certain accessible small areas, altogether about seven acres. On this irrigated ground we produced about $2000.00 worth of cabbage from four acres; $400.00 m sweet corn from one acre; 12,000 lbs. of celery from one-half acre ; 36,000 lbs. mangel wurzel beets from another half acre. Water was had from a hose attached to a convenient fire plug. The success of the venture encourages us to plan for a well solely for irrigation, so located as to water forty to fifty acres. If we are successful m a comparable degree with this well, we expect to demonstrate that it is entirely possible wih a sufficien number of wells to insure our garden and much of the farm from the vagaries of weather. We are favorably situated for such a program because at a depth of 160 fees we strike water tearing gravel that is 100 feet thick, 59 </seg>
            <seg id="p060">60 We have a splendid herd of Holstein cattk, heavy producers, individually and collectively, and free from tuberculosis Our swine are of equally high grade, bringing always the top market price, while we have large flocks of chickens, ducks and turkeys. New hog ad poultry houses will now enable us to increase produc - tion m this very profitable direction. During the last spring, we had an epidemic of typhoid, starting probably from some carrier, as our water and milk were declared uncontaminated. We had several fatalities. When diagnosis was finally established, we immunized the whole institution and quickly eradicated this disease. Otherwise, the health of the patient population has been good, with no more than the usual incidence of disease. In closing this report, I wish to express the sincere apprecia - tion of patiens, employees and officers alike for the manifest interest m institution affairs displayed by the officers of the state govern - ment and of the substantial policy for the conduct of such institu - tions resultant therefrom, particularly as to the constitution and authority of the Board of Control. Respectfully submitted, GEORGE M. WHITE, Superintendent. </seg>

            <seg id="p073">To tlie Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I hereby have the honor of submitting the Twenty-eighth Biennial Reportof the Lincoln State Hospital for the period cover - ing twenty-four months, from July 1, 1925, to June 30, 1927. The medical' staff remains as it was two years ago with one exception. Dr. J. Blame Babcock resigned on March 31, 1927, to accept the position of Assistant Superintendent at the Hastings State Hospital, Ingleside, Nebraska. His place was filled by Dr. W. E. Dickinson who entered the service on June 1, 1927. Members of the staff have manifested a keen interest m their work. Efforts directed to the restoration of patients through modern treatment have been vigorous. The hydrotherapeutic rooms have afforded great relief to indicated cases and have proven very valuable along with the other modes of treatment. Mrs: Margaret Hay resigned as matron, having been appointed as Superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children. She was succeeded/by Mrs. Stella Clay. Dr. William I. Rotton, who has been with us since September 1, 1925, treats and -extracts the teeth of our patients when neces - sary. His services have been very beneficial to the health of our patients. Religious services are held each Sunday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. Dr. Thomas A. Maxwell, our chaplain, conducts the services and the hour of chapel service is most profitable. The usual amusements have been carried on during this biennium. On Tuesday evenings the moving picture show is given ; each Friday night a patients' dance ; occassional entertain - ment is secured outside of these by the University Players, etc. On holidays we have special dinners and some sort of entertainment, usually music. 73 </seg>
            <seg id="p074">The treatment and care of the patients are the things for which the hospital is maintained. One of the most important things m the treatment of the insane is to constantly maintain an optimistic at - mosphere. It should be remembered that if a patient does not recover to the extent where he can return to his home or community and it should be necessary for him to remain m custody and be cared for during his remaining years, he should be guided and helped so as to spend a fairly happy and useful life m the hospital. We are of the opinion that the state, through the Board of Control, should be closer touch socially with Out-Clinics and Social Workers. Our new kitchen with employees' rooms above, which was completed about a year ago, is all that we had hoped for and is meeting our needs m a very satisfactory manner. We feel that we should say something of our Receiving Hospital, of which we are justly proud. It has proven a great help m the treatment of our patients. We feel that when all the departments are fully equipped, this hospital will be second to none. The porches on the "C" building have completed and arc occupied at this time. They afford the patients m this building more light and fresh air, besides making room for more patients. Farm and garden products during the first year of the biennium were very good, but the yield for the second year was decidedly short of our expectations due to the drought. Hence, our income for this biennium was considerably less than it has been heretofore, which, m no small degree, accounts for the shortage m funds at the end of the period. In conclusion I wish to thank His Excellency, the Governor, and the Honorable Members of the Board of Control for their courteous consideration and for the confidence, kind assistance .-« - and advice they have extended to me thoughout" the year ; also, the officers and employees associated with me who have been loyal and faithful during the past biennium. Respectfully submitted, D. G. GRIFFITHS, Superintendent. 74 </seg>

            <seg id="p089">89 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the honor of presenting herewith the Nineteenth Biennial Report of the Norfolk State Hospital, which covers a period from July 1, 1925, to June 30, 1927. The general health of the patients has been very good. During the biennium there were a few cases of smallpox. All were mild cases. Our contagion was brought m by- a patient who, within a few days after his arrival here, broke out with smallpox. All cases were confined to the sick ward on the male side. Following the slight epidemic we vaccinated every patient m the institution for smallpox. This is now routine practice and every patient received is vaccinated for smallpox and typhoid fever. Staff meetings are held regularly every day. At these meetings discussions are had pertaining to hospital cases, the diagnoses of new patients and the institution management. We have had the usual amusements, namely, motion picture shows, baseball games, etc. Inasmuch as the patients seem to get so much real enjoyment out of motion picture, we hope to be able to hold two shows a week when our new Amusement Hall is com - pleted. We will also be able to have band concerts and plays from the city, which will tend to make our people more satisfied. Occupation is generally recognized as a potent factor m the treatment of mental diseases. Patients who are capable and willing to work are assigned to such tasks as we feel they are able to per - form. It is hoped that we may be able to establish additional industries whereby more of our men and women may find suitable occupation. </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 The farm and gardens have produced abundantly. The last legislature appropriated sufficient funds for the purchase of an additional 160 acres of land just north of us. The purchase of this land was recommended by the management of the institution some time ago. It is planned that the farm buildings, corrals, etc., will be moved from their present location to the new farm. The state owns at Norfolk one of the best Holstein herds m Nebraska which helps to furnish nutritious food for the patients. I take this opportunity to thank the many friends of the institu - tion who have contributed reading material for the patients ; also, to extend to the Norfolk Firemen's Hand our appreciation for the number of concerts they have given us. In closing this report, it is my desire to express my sincere appreciation for the faithful service rendered by the many employees and the valuable assistance given me by the officers of the hospital. I wish to extend my gratitude to the Hoard of Control for the efficient cooperation and personal kindnesses accorded me. Respectfully submitted, G. E. CHARLTON, Superintendent. </seg>

            <seg id="p101">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. We submit herewith the Sixth Biennial Report of the Board of Examiners of Defectives, covering the period beginning July 1, 1925, and ending June 30, 1927. This Board was created and ap - pointed by the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, com - plying with Chapter 237, Laws of Nebraska, 1915, entitled "An Act to authorize the sterilization of feeble-minded and insane inmates of state institutions, m certain cases, and to provide for the appoint - ment of a commission, and to define their powers and duties m connection therewith." ■ . . &lt;^- There have been several meetings of the Board of Examiners of Defectives held during the past two years. Meetings are called by tlie chairman on request of the superintendents of the different state hospitals. Appended to this report will be found five tables : Table I, referring to the Hastings State Hospital ; Table 11, Lincoln State Hospital; Table 111, Norfolk State Hospital; Table IV, Ne - braska Institution for Feeble-Minded ; Table V, combined report of the action of the Board as it pertains to all of the institutions. There was a total of 159 patients examined m four state in - stitutions. The institutions were given authority to sterilize 102 patients before parole or discharge be granted. Of this number, 39 have been sterilized. The remaining 72 patients are still residents of the institutions, being as yet unable mentally to take their former place m society. ■ • ! Section 1 of the law governing this Board reads as follows: "Sterilization of feeble-minded or insane inmates of state institu - tions. Hereafter, no feeble-minded or insane inmate, physically capable of bearing or begetting offspring, shall be paroled or dis - charged from the institution for the feeble-minded, or the hospital for the insane, nor paroled from the penitentiary, reformatory, 101 </seg>
            <seg id="p102">industrial home, industrial schools or other such state institutions, except as hereinafter provided, or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction." The Board has adopted and followed a conservative policy m dealing with applicants for sterilization. i\o controversies have been invited nor entered into, perjudices m most cases have been overcome and religious scruples have always been respected. No patients have been sterilized without full consent of the relatives and the consent of the patient himself. Authority to sterilize has not been given m any case until after careful consideration of the per - sonal and family history of the patient, and the Board convinced that the patient was capable of bearing or begetting offsprings, and that the offsprings "would inherit a tendency to feeblel-minded - ness, insanity, or degeneracy, and that such children would probably become a social menace and that procreation by such inmate would be harmful to society." In every case operated upon, recovery was prompt and complete. Respectfully submitted, D. G. GRIFFTHS, Chairman. G. E. CHARLTOX, Secretary. G. M. WHITE, J.H.MATTHAI, L. T. SIDWELL.

            <seg id="p107">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. The Twenty-third Biennial Report of the State Industrial School, for the oeriod ending June 30, 1927, is herewith respectfully submitted. The school yprk provided for the boys of this institution is determined by the! state course of study for public schools of Ne - braska outlined bn the state superintendent of public instruction. Three- school rooms are utilized m the instruction of the grade work presented to the boys. One room is devoted to high school work which includes the ninth and tenth grades. A fifth room is devoted to the commercial school where . are taught shorthand, typewriting, bookeepihg and business practice. . ■ . Much attention is' given to the instruction- of music. A- very capable band man trains and conducts the twenty-five boys m the band and orchestra. Apprenticeships are given our boys m the following trades and lines of occupation : tailoring, shoemaking, printing, painting, mechanics, laundering, carpentering, cooking and baking. The boys are m school half of each day and attend to ther trades and occupations the other half. Vigilant supervision m boyhood is th guaranty of fully de - veloped citizenship. The State Industrial provides such supervi - sion. It is our aim to have the boys so live m this school that they will go out into the world and continue the habits and practices they learned here, thus becoming useful citizens. The sanitary condition of the school is deemed excellent by medical authority. Simplicity and cleanliness are the aims of those who pride themselves on the appearance of the institution property. The health among our boys has been generally so good that it is pleasing to report no deaths among the many boys cared for m the institution during the twenty-four months. It is a source of real pleasure to note the marked improvement m the physical condition of the many boys after entering the State Industrial School. ; The merit system authorized by the Board of Control is a marked aid m the maintenance of discipline m the school. . Each boy is required to earn 18,000 credits at which time he may be 107 </seg>
            <seg id="p108">paroled. The better his behavior, the more painstaking he is with the institution duties, the more effort he puts into his studies, the more rapidly he gains his credits and is entitled to his parole. Each boy is able to determine to a marked degree the time he shall spend m the institution. His desire for liberty, and the desire to return to loved ones at home, prompt him to put forth every effort to do his best. A few boys have earned their credits m nine months, but more take about fourteen months. Honesty is encouraged by offer - ing each boy 3,000 extra credits for truthfulness and trustworthi - ness during his stay m the school. This system serves the excellent purpose of securing good deportment m the school at all times. The workers m the school are ever mindful of the moral train - ing due our boys. Earnest endeavor is put forth to encourage young men to lead pure lives. The spiritual welfare is provided for by means of chapel services every Sunday afternoon at 2 :40 and by Sunday School each Sabbath morning m the various cot - tages. Ministers speak who encourage the boys to lead Christian lives. During the past twenty-four months many needed improve - ments have been made, namely : The painting of the barn, gymnasium, shop building, superin - tendent's cottage and main building; new fencing about the institu - tion farm ; installation of steam heat and hot water lines to the barns; moving of former ice house to the north part of the institu - tion grounds where it serves as an excellent storeroom for feed, grain and machinery; remodeling of fourth story of Trades build - ing into living room ; erection of new dairy barn and green house; graveling of roads from the Lincoln Highway to and about the in - stitution grounds. We are especially proud of the three physical benefits enjoyed by this institution : the complete tunnel system ; the modern hospi - tal ; and the commodious gymnasium. My sincere thanks are extended to the member of the Board of Control for their systematic aid, encouragement and kindness. Also, I wish to thank my faithful, conscientious co-workers, the citizens of Nebraska, the judges and the executive officers who have encouraged and helped m this great work. Respectfully submitted, R. V. CLARK, Superintendent. 108 </seg>

            <seg id="p117">To the Governor and the Board o{ Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith submit the Seventh Biennial Report of the Hospital for Tuberculous, covering the period from July 1, 1925 to June 30, 1927. . " During this period we have been somewhat handicapped on ac - count of lack of funds due m part to an unfortunate accident at our power plant and laundry.. Many needed improvements and repairs have been held up on this account. Notwithstanding all this, how - ever! nothing has been left undone that might make our patients comfortable or assist m their recovery. Twenty-two percent of all the patients discharged during the biennium were arrested, or apparently arrested, and if we exclude those who remained less than three months the number of those arrested, or apparently arrested, is thirty-seven percent of the total number discharged, It is interesting to note that twenty-eight per - cent of the deaths occur within one month after arrival at the hospi - tal and that forty-six percent of deaths occur within three months. This would indicate that we arc receiving a large percentage of far advanced cases. I am convinced that there should be some organization m the state to make researches and report bacillus carriers. An educa - tional campaign should be carried on m each county. Each county should have a nurse and health officer whose duty it would be to examine these cases and advise them regarding home treatment and the means of protecting those with whom they come m contact, or better still acquaint them with the advantages of sanitarium treat - ment and arrange to send them to this hospital. It is not generally known that the state maintains an up-to-date sanitarium where citizens may obtain free care and treatment. Those who do know are loathe to leave their homes without some encouragement. During the course of a year a great many applications for admission together with literature, are sent to people who have made inquiry regarding the hospital. However, we find that very few applica - tions are completed and returned. During the biennium we have had fifteen girls and eleven boys under twelve years of age. All these children are making satisfac- 117 </seg>
            <seg id="p118">Tory recoveries. The institution maintains classes for the children during the school year which they attend from 9:00 until 11 -.30 each morning. In the afternoon they are m bed from 1 :00 until 4 :00, as are all of our patients. Our children have been provided with bath - ing suits, and during the summer they spend a great many hours m the open air and sunlight, thus acquiring a healthy coat of tan. In the fall of 1926 I made some preliminary plans for a chil - dren's building. This would have provided room for the general offices of the institution, living quarters for the doctors, a school room, an auditorium and rooms for twenty-six children, but, as the legislature declined to consider any plans for new buildings, this will have to wait for another two years at least. Besides giving us a place for children, this building would have made it possible for us to have converted the top floor of the hosptial now used for offices into rooms for bedfast patients. I would recommend that the porches of the Mast Sun building be glassed m so that we can make use of them m winter. Arrange - ments can be made for ventilation and on pleasant days the win - dows may be opened. ' Hir patients should not be required to use up their energy m combating the cold m order to get the sunlight which is such an essential pan of their treatment. These glass I rames could be taken down m summer and stored. We have made a few needed improvements during this bien - nium. The old elevator m the hospital building was changed over to an automatic traction type. The motor, a single phase 110 volt, has been replaced by a 220 volt, three phase motor. The motor and hoisting machinery have been lined up. bearings rebabbitted, etc.. so that we now have a very dependable and convenient elevator. A large machine shed has been built on the north of the barn. This shed is 14 feet by 42 feet and was built entirely of form lumber which had been used m repairing our boiler house following the accident m November, 1925. In closing this report 1 want to thank the members of the Hoard of Control for their wise counsel, patience and consideration at all times, and the officers and employees, associated with me, for their loyal support and efficient services. Respectfully submitted, J. A. BURFORD, Superintendent, 118 </seg>

            <seg id="p129">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. The Eleventh Biennial Report covering the operation of the Orthopedic Hospital for the period ending June 30, 1927, is here - with respectfully submitted. The purpose of the Orthopedic Hospital is for the correction of twisted little bodies of children and prevention of deformities. It stands as an advisor to the medical and surgical professions of our state. Application for admission, examination and possible treatment is made direct to the superintendent of the hospital. No charge is made for the hospital service or for the medical or sur - gical procedure, if such is indicated after careful observation and examination of the patient. However, parents or caretakers are re - quired to supply adequate clothing and meet the expense of mechan - ical appliances if these are indicated. The patients, while under treatment m the Orthopedic Hospital, are given the advantages of continuing their school work, and classes are conducted each day m all grades up to and including the eighth.' After completing the eighth grade the pupil is permitted to take the examinations of the county for admission to high school. It is pleasing to state that m 1926 we had seven such graduates. The Orthopedic Training School for Nurses is under direct supervision of the superintendent of the hospital. A superintendent of nurses has charge of the student body, administering to its needs and aiding whenever necessary. Through her the student body is directed and classes are held through the school year. The require - ments are the same as maintained by all A-Class schools, two years of high school or the equivalent being necessary for admission. A period of probation is held and each student qualifying at the end of this period is given her cap and joins the regular student body as a junior student nurse. The teaching staff consists of active practicing specialists m their respective lines, thus assuringj the student all that is new and up to the minute. Six months or the senior year are taken at an affiliating hospital where general work is given. 129 </seg>
            <seg id="p130">The Orthopedic Hospital is the only institution of its kind m the state. This hospital is an acute hospital and m no sense is it custodial. Every resident is receiving active treatment and as soon as a resident has received all that can he done to aid him he is dis - charged or paroled and then is considered an "out patient." These "out patients" visit the clinic every thirty clays or oftener for observation and advice. The medical profession throughout the state has come to refer to us for help and advice m cases beyond its individual control. The hospital laboratory is a very important part of the institu - tion and here all possible tests are made to help m the adjustment of the physical and structural needs of the patient. Wasserman tests are made for us at the state laboratory, and we wish to extend our gratitude for the efficient manner m which this laboratory has cooperated with us and for the perfect service and courtesy always extended. We are pleased to report that no epidemics have been en - countered. The general health of the population has been good. Fresh air. sunshine, good food, and prompt and skillful medical and surgical attention are the foundation upon which this hospital functions. This report would be decidedly incomplete without mention of those who have helped with the problem of amusement for the patients. Many clubs, societies, business firms, as well as lodges and private individuals, have contributed to the amusement and comfort of the little wards, and we wish to express our appreciation of all that has been done. Through their endeavors these bene - factors have greatly helped to bring the children to a state of normalcy and we hope that we may hold this kind friendship for all times. We feel greatly indebted to the honorable members of the Board of Control inasmuch as the .smooth and efficient functioning of this institution depends largely upon their kind counsel and ministrations. They have been ready and willing at all times to weigh methods and render advice which has been respected and deeply appreciated. Respect fully submitted, J. 11. MATTHAI, Superintendent. 130 </seg>

            <seg id="p141">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I hereby present to you the Biennial Report of the Nebraska State Penitentiary, covering the period from July 1, 1925, to June 30,1927. At the present time we have four hundred men employed making work shirts and lumber jackets ; seventy-five manufacturing furniture; seventy-five on construction work, and fanning and gardening ; the remainder of the men are employed as coal shovel - ers, cell house men, cooks, waiters, mechanics, etc. The women are employed m the making of work shirts and garments of different kinds for other institutions. Needless to say, the institution has been very crowded during the past biennium, and we have been required to house some two hundred men outside our cell houses, making it necessary to employ more guards. However, this condition has been somewhat relieved m the work shops by the erection of a new office and shop building. Upon completion of our new power plant outside the walls, the old buildings inside will be remodeled so as to afford additional dormi - tory room. Our prison night school where work up to and including the ninth garde is taught is well attended. About one hundred seventy - five men are enrolled. We find this school very beneficial to our men, and they work faithfully to improve their education. Reverend Maxwell, our regular chaplain, Father Ford, our voluntary chaplain, and a number of Lincoln people look after our religious work on Sundays. For diversion we have ball games on Saturday afternoons and picture shows on Sunday afternoons, as well as periods of outdoor recreation. Our prison library is cared for by one of the men and is well patronized by the inmates. In conclusion I wish to thank the Honorable Board of Control, and His Excellency, Governor McMtiJleri, for their kind considera - tion and administration m the affairs of the institution. I also wish to extend sincere thanks to my co-workers for their loyalty and co-operation. Respectfully submitted, W. T. FENTON, Warden. 141 </seg>

            <seg id="p155">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. We take pleasure m submitting to you the Twentieth Biennial Report of the Nebraska Industrial Home. We feel that the past two years have been very profitable m the work accomplished with our girls. They have taken great interest m the training, given and m keeping the Home m splendid condition. We have been very fortunate m finding such excellent homes (or our babies. Of the forty-seven placed m temporary homes, thirty-two have been legally adopted and the other cases are waiting for final papers. The homes are thoroughly investigated before placing a child and again visited after the babe has been m the home for' some time. Many of the foster parents bring the children back to visit us. More of the girls are keeping their babies than ever before. Sunday morning we have our Sabbath School and Sunday evening we have our Young People's Meeting. Thursday evening is set aside for the regular preaching services. A part of the time has been given to Bible study and since we have purchased new Bibles so" that each girl has one at her disposal, we have been greatly pleased at the enthusiasm and interest they have shown m this study. This past year eleven girls and six babes have been baptized. At all times'we bring to the girls' attention the need of facing lite squarely and the necessity of right living to make not only the Home a happier place but to prepare them to again take their place m society and to meet their problems courageously and with the determination to prove that one can come back and become a useful and right living citizen. The girls are given thorough training along the line of home economics. In the kitchen they are taught the preparation and correct serving of meals, and canning. We have been greatly pleased with the interest shown and the progress each girl has made m this department. .The different divisions are cooking, baking, preparing vegetables, caring for milk, churning and the serving of meals. Eleven girls are assigned work m this department. For the past two years we have been able to churn sufficient butter to furnish the tables the greater share of the time. Four 155 </seg>
            <seg id="p156">thousand two hundred seventy-one pounds of butter have been churned. We are very proud of our laundry as it is the best equipped of all departments. The girls enjoy learning to manage the different machines. Thirteen girls are busy m this department. Five iron, four mangle, two manage the drying tumbler and the steam driers and two have charge of the machinery m the wash room. Ten thousand one hundred sixty-five pieces are handled weekly, and the work is beautifully done. All of the sewing for the institution is done m our sewing room. All clothing is furnished both girls and babes while they are m the Home. If a girl makes a good record, when the time conies for her to return to her home she is given a blue serge and a white poplin dress, three bungalow aprons and two sets of underclothing, so that her wardrobe is extensive enough to last until she can earn her own. The babes are furnished a complete wardrobe also. Each girl, unless for some cause she is not able to be taught, makes her own and her babe's clothing. All kinds of fancy work are learned m this department. This past winter one afternoon each week was set aside for the teaching of basket weaving, polychroming and the making of paper (lowers. The girls greatly enjoy this new line and made some yen beautiful things. The only recreation the girls have is what we arrange for them. For Christmas last year money was furnished so that we bouglii a loud speaker, and after having had the wire extended from the superintendent's radio (o the chapel, the loud speaker being connect - ed, gives the girls an opportunity to hear good programs. In conclusion we wish to extend to the members of the Board of Control our hearty appreciation of their confidence and assistance which we have received at all times. Each one has been very patient with us and we know that as far as the IJoard has been able to supply us, everything has been allowed. The success of the work for the biennium has been very largely due to the support and cooperation of my co-workers and the girls. All have shown a willingness to do whatever they could to make this a real home. Respectfully submitted. M. EVELYX MEYER. Superintendent. 156 </seg>

            <seg id="p167">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. This report covers the progress of the Nebraska School for the Blind during the bierinuim from and including July 1, 1925, to June 30, 1927. A successful period this has been m the history of the institution, though nothing phenomenal. During the first year of the biennium the attendance went up a little above normal, through no reason apparent; and during the second year it fell slightly below. Possibly the decrease may be partially accounted for m the fact that we are not encouraging adults to enroll. During the whole period our morale has been good. Thanks are extended to the Board of Control and all of the teachers and employees for helpful co-operation. We shall miss Hon. L. C. ObeHies, 1 am .sure; but shall receive, I am just as certain, the same .sympathetic support from his successor, Hon. Harry S. Thorpe. One of the deep concerns of our force is the health of our Wind and .defective-sighted people. The physical health of our pupils has been remarkably good during the whole biennium. Several years ago the Board of Control, upon recommendation of the superintendent; granted me permission to use the Relief of the Blind Fund (which is outside of the regular school appropriation) for such cases needing hospital care as our institution physician and 1 deemed necessary. Under this arrangement there have been thirty -three of our pupils who have had special treatment, some of them going more than once to specialists and some of them having more than one physical defect that needed correction. So far as I know, this service, previous to the permission granted me by the Board of Control, has not been available. On account of the lack of available funds, only a few minor improvements and additions have been made to our physical plant m the last biennium. Inside painting went on during the last sum - mer. The old steam-hoist ash remover was torn out; the iron sold 167 </seg>
            <seg id="p168">as junk ; and the street east of our boiler-house |&gt;ut m presentable shape. To save the back of our engineer, who had wheeled tons of ashes up a rather steep inclined plane to the street, the Hoard suggested a tunnel, which was built at a slight expense and which has served admirably. The bath-room m the superintedent's apart - ment has been fitted out with new plumbing. In the chapel our stage has been raised and a curtain erected — an improvement that has given the teachers and pupils as much joy as anything done for them m many years. A new cookstove has replaced the small worn-out one m the domestic science kitchen. Perhaps the visitor of summer before last who should return at this time would note the great improvement m our campus and garden. Today we have the best garden and the whole physical plant, save the building itself, looks the best that I have ever known it. I should add, perhaps, that the work done m early spring by tree surgeons on our 300 trees did much to enhance the beauty of our grounds. In the Eastern States great sums of money are set aside, gifts and bequests of the rich, as (rust funds for the use of public institu - tions. In the Western States ior possibly I should say the Middle West) there has been a tendency to look wholly to state appropria - tions for financing. Aside from the very liberal donations of Charles 11. Morrill recently to the University of Xebra^ka. nothing particularly has been done by private persons m Nebraska to assist public institutions. There has been a feeling that state paternalism, verging on socialism, is entirely adequate. Private donations have apparently been repelled, not invited. I am rather questioning at this time the old attitude. Ought not the State extend encourage - ment to persons of. means suggesting that help be afforded, rather than to repel such donations? This wiU lighten the burden of taxa - tion upon those who can ill afford to pay more for the up-keep of the state and will, at the same time, give our state institutions ample funds to compete m equipment and personnel with schools and other institutions elsewhere. We have been trying earnestly during the biennium to increase the interest m our work and to spread knowledge of our school. I suppose there have been more than the average number of items about the work carried on and more than the usual publicity. News - papers have been very kind m allotting space. Some of the contacts 168 </seg>
            <seg id="p169">were made through groups of pupils giving programs or parts of programs to special bodies, either outside or here at the institution. I recall such contacts with Rotary Club at Nebraska City, Woman's Club at Peru, Kiwanis at Omaha, allied clubs at Nebraska City, and Fourteenth Street School Parent-Teacher Asssociation. Five of our girls were given a glorious outing at Camp Crete shortly after the close of school this year. Writes Miss Jennie E. Johnson, our teacher who was with the girls at Crete: "It seems to me that our week at Camp Crete was a most unususal opportunity. By partici - pating m all activities so far as possible we had a very enjoyable outing, to say nothing of the social contact, a thing we so sorely need." The tables attached, which conform with the instructions of the Board of Control, are to be taken as part of this report. Respectfully submitted, 'N. C. ABBOTT, Superintendent. 169 </seg>

I have the honor to present to you this the Twenty-ninth Biennial Report of the Nebraska School for the Deaf. The history of our school dales hack to its founding in 1869, when, the Legislature having appropriated $6,600.00 for the pur - pose,, twelve pupils were given training in a leased building in Omaha, a small one-story structure, south of St. Mary's Avenue, near the corner of 19th Street, for which a rental of $300.00 per year was paid. The second year the attendance was increased to twenty-three, twelve children being refused admission for want of room. This condition was advanced as a reason for the appeal made for an appropriation for a building for the school and the Legislature in 1871 granted $15,000.00 to be used for the erection of such a building. Land in the amount of ten acres having been purchased for $600.00, the money having been given by citizens of Omaha, a brick building, 44 by 60 feet, three stories high, was erected on the tract, and the school was removed in January, .1872, to its present location, the building provided constituting the north - ern wing of the present main building. As time went on and the attendance grew, additional buildings were provided, until now the school operates in seven units or structures, with 190 pupils in atendance. Also the ground area was in 1875 enlarged by purchase by the state from original ten acres to twenty-three acres. In the 58 years of the school's history there have been enrolled 1,170 deaf children who have received the benefits of the educa - tional opportunties provided, which means that over one thousand human beings — otherwise ignorant, helpless and dependent — have been salvaged and restored to society, being changed, in practically all cases, into intelligent, self-supporting, property-owning, family - rearing citizens. 175 </seg>
            <seg id="p176">; The 190 pupils of the school are taught by 19 class teachers, giving an average of 10 pupils m a class. It is found, because of the special and intensive instruction required by the deaf child, particularly m training him m speech and lip-reading, that the number of pupils m a class under one teacher must be limited. While our average is ten pupils m a class, m many schools m the country the average is nine, m others eight, m others seven and even six, so it is noted the tendency to place teachers m charge of small groups m order that pupils under them shall have instruction shaped to meet their individual requirements. The ratio of the deaf to the hearing m the general population of the country is one deaf m every two thousand persons, and neces - sarily this ratio prevails among children of school age. Fifty years ago the ratio of the deaf to the hearing m all countries where statis - tics were gathered was one to fifteen hundred. Thus our figures show a reduction of deafness m later years, due doubtless to the discovery of causes and the adoption of preventive or curative means m the treatment of the various diseases that cause deafness. But congential deafness seems not to have been lessened m its re - currences, and. because of the rarity of deafness m the category of defects, it may never have the study given it m medical science such as shall lead to the discovery of preventive measures. However, as heredity is recognized as m cases a cause of deafness, it is strongly advised that the born deaf do not marry the born deaf, and especial - ly that they do not marry into families where deafness is known to prevail m various branches, or to have recurred m successive generations. The table of assigned causes of deafness m the cases of the 190 pupils m school at the close of the biennium shows 61 per cent as born deaf, 37 per cent as made deaf by disease, and 2 per cent deaf from causes unknown. Spinal meningitis is the disease most prolific of deafness; scarlet fever coming next; and influenza next. The course of the school covers twelve grades and the average pupil completes the course m twelve years. Entering school at six years of age and starting with no knowledge of language, the first instruction is m training m the production af articulate sounds as the elements or factors of speech. These sounds properly combined make syllables and words. Lip-reading is likewise taught m train - ing the pupil to recognize lip movements as symobls or signs for thoughts. 176 </seg>
            <seg id="p177">The advanced instruction given corresponds to that given m the high schools for hearing children, and it prepares pupils for entrance to Gallaudet College at Washington, a college established and maintained by the national government where five years of additional training is provided for those of our pupils who avail themselves of it. At present we have five students matriculating at the college. Industrial training is given to all pupils old enough to receive it. An equipped industrial^ department provides instruction for hoys m manual training or carpentry, printing, and gardening ; and for girls m domestic art and m domestic science. Nine pupils graduated m June, 1926; and thirteen pupils m June, 1927. The total number of graduates of the school m its history is 203. Thus about 20 per cent of the total number of pupils who have attended the school have carried the course to its completion. In conclusion I wish to express my appreciation of the interest taken by the Board m the work .being done m the school, and like - wise m its cooperation m the carrying out of its plans; also to ex - press my appreciation of the service of the teachers and officers, who have contributed so much and so unselfishly toward the success of the work. Respectfully submitted, F. W. BOOTH, Superintendent. 177 </seg>

            <seg id="p187">To the Governor and the Board- of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the honor to present a report of the work done by the State Reformatory for Women during the two years ending June 30. 1927. Our work has been more satisfactory during this period than ever before on account of better equipment and a less crowded condition m the institution. We hope to increase our equipment and buildings during the next biennium. The majority of girls admitted here have some form of venereal disease. Our aim is to render them non-infectious and to cure. them as soon as possible. There have been no contagious diseases and no deaths, and the general health of the inmates has been very good. We have had two major operations performed by Drs. Bell and Bell. In- both cases we had favorable results. . When, a girl leaves this institutions she is a good many pounds heavier than when she enters. This is evidence of wholesome living, effective sanitation and good medical treatment. We moved into our new building m March, 1927. We have m all fifty-four single rooms, many of them being equipped with lavatories. The shower baths are much appreciated. Our sewing room is under the managment of Mrs. Bessie Bradley. The girls make shirts for other state institutions. They also make all their own dresses and do the sewing for the institu - tion. Fancy work is taught and during the State Fair we had some of our work on exhibition. Every six weeks we have change of detail so that each girl may learn all the different kinds of work. Immediately after breakfast we have school. There are three classes, one m algebra and the other two covering the studies of hygiene, reading, spelling, geog - raphy and arithmetic. The State Library Commission loans us books and sends us a number of monthly magazines. 187 </seg>

            <seg id="p199">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith submit the biennial report of the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children for the period from July 1, 1925 to June 30, 1927. The last year brought a realization of the long cherished dream. The legislature of 1925 appropriated money for a new Home and the Board of Control purchased approximately seven acres on which was a large residence. This house was remolded so as to meet the institution needs. The Board also bought an adjoining cottage, thereby laying the foundation for the cottage system, the ideal sys - tem for a children!s home. In addition to the foregoing, a small 40-acre farm was purchased. On the 10th of September, 1926, the children were moved from the old Home to the new. The boys and girls seem to be very happy m their new home. The small acreage that was bought will afford the older boys an opportunity to study farming and agriculture,. thus preparing them - selves to earn a livelihood after leaving the home. Some of the finer arts are taught the girls along with training them for their probable occupation of homemakers. Receiving children into our Home is one of the purposes for which this institution was established. In order to be able to receive or admit all that are sent to us, it is very necessary that we find homes for as many as possible. Not only is it necessary to find homes for our children from the viewpoint of making room for others, but also from the viewpoint of the welfare of the child. Each and every child craves and demands the love and affection that can be given only when individual attention is possible and the child realizes he is an important link m the family circle. In order to carry out this plan a- Field Worker is employed who investigates the homes of all applicants for children and no home is accepted until references are given and everything possible done to 197 </seg>
            <seg id="p200">protect the child. In the case of infants, adoption papers are not issued before a period of six months or a year has elapsed. The placing of a child m a tentative home does not end our responsibility. A follow-up policy is carried on and each child is visited as often as time will permit. If any child is dissatisfied or not doing well he is returned to the state Home and another effort is made to find a home that will be satisfactory. No race, creed or color line is drawn. The homeless, neglected or abandoned child must be received and cared for. The Home must be a real Home to the white child, the Mexican or the Negro. These children are the future citizens of our great state an,d must be guided and helped m the process of building useful lives. What a responsibility is placed upon us. Are we, as mature citizens and molders of coming generations, going to meet this great problem and become a state one hundred percent efficient m the care of our friendless? He who gives the child a treat. Makes joy bells ring m Heaven's street ; And he who gives the child a home. Builds palaces m Kingdom Come. Respectfully submitted. MARGARET E. HAY. Superintendent. 198 </seg>

            <seg id="p209">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. As Superintendent of the State Reformatory for Men, it is my pleasure to submit for your consideration a report for the Biennium beginning July 1, 1925 and ending June 30, 1927. Five years have elapsed since the opening of this institution and each added year finds it growing daily into a more through and organized institution. Special effort has been made m the selection of employees as to their fitness for the tasks assigned them m the care and guidance of the inmates of whom they have charge. Consequently, our staff of employees has gradually grown into a competent group, each play - ing a very important part m the training of men sentenced here from over the state for incarceration, discipline and reformation. The combination of institutional financial profit and inmate reformation requires much thought and labor to show dividends m each department. We are endeavoring to have our industry a means to the end of reformation for the prisoner who is to be re - stored to freedom and expected to be self-supporting and a re - spected member of society. Our school system cares for those whose educational training has not carried them beyond the eighth grade. We are continuing our telegraphic department and are pleased to state that some of the men who studied telegraphy during their school hours here are now holding responsible positions m telegraphic departments on the out - side. Our several industrial departments are functioning properly and are being continued and added to whenever deemed advisable. The chapel services held regularly every Sunday afternoon continue to be interesting to the extent that the entire population looks forward to the next Sunday service. The assistance rendered 207 </seg>
            <seg id="p210">208 by the clergy representing all creeds from the city of Lincoln is highly appreciated by all attending these services. We feel that special mention should be made of the untiring effort made by Dr. B. A. Finkle m keeping the health of the popula - tion up to the high standard that we enjoy. Whatever success we may have attained has come about by the loyalty and cooperation of the associate officers and employees of this institution. To each member of the Board we feel especially indebted for the thoughtful consideration shown this institution and its officers m the many perplexing problems presented to them m the work of building this institution. To Governor McMullen we likewise feel indebted for his thoughtful expression of appreciation and his cheerful readiness and helpfulness m all of the matters brought be - fore him for his disposition. Respectfully submitted, A. W. MILLER, Superintendent. </seg>
