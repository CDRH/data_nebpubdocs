            <seg id="p003">SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OK TRADE AND COMMERCE 3 September 30, 1921. Hon. S. R. McKelvie, Governor Herewith I submit the 29th annual report of the Building and Loan Associations of the State for the year ending June 30th, 1921. All things considered, this is a splendid report, but not up to standard set by the 1920 report. Receipts and disbursements show a falling off of 27 per cent as compared with 1920, and compares favorably with the 1919 report in this particular. Total resources and liabilities show a pain of $6,131,676.17 or approximately 8 per cent for the year and is accounted for by the installments and accumulations in the running stock ac - count. The paid-up stock account shows a loss of five per cent owing to heavy withdrawals on account of higher rates of in - terest offered by commercial enterprises. The decrease in receipts and disbursements is accounted for by the financial stringency which resulted in $8,127,445.74 less payments to retire loans. Very few new loans were made during the year and the general condition is now better as to cash reserves and the associations are now making some loans, but amounts are restricted and applications very carefully se - lected. Two new associations were organized during the year: The Home Building and Loan at McCook and the Mutual Savings and Loan at Omaha, making a total of seventy-six associations reporting. There were no liquidations- Very respectfully, J. E. HART, Secretary. Department of Trade and Commerce. </seg>

            <seg id="p168">SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE 3 September 30, 1922. Herewith I submit the 30th annual report of the Building and Loan Association of the State for the year ending June 30th, 1922, compiled from reports required by Section 17, Arti - cle 19, of the 1919 Session Laws. This report shows an increase in the gross assets of $7, - 923,716.00, or 9.4 per cent over the 1921 report. Receipts and disbursements show practically the same ratio of increase over the former year, but do not equal the record of 1920, the exact increase being $4,937,741.45. Five new Associations were added during the year, mak - ing eighty reporting. The Associations are rapidly recovering from the adverse conditions of 1921 and the larger Associations are seeking good loans and report very few foreclosures. Every consistent consideration should be shown to these Associations in their program of "Home Builders." Very respectfully J. E. HART, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce. Hon. S. R.
