         <seg id="p007">DIVISION OF ASSISTANCE The impact of defense and war on the community and the State brings about many changes in the lives of the citizens of that State. Not only do families find it necessary to make adjustments in an emer - gent situation, but governmental function, as well, must be tuned to the exigencies of the day. The Division of Public Assistance is no exception ; to this demand for readjustment, and every effort has been put forth to maintain a high level of performance on the job while accepting the limitations of personnel'and travel which were bound to occur. It was soon recognized that modifications in established procedures and pol - icies were necessary, and administrative changes have -been made to keep the program in step with the war effort. . As early as March, 1942, it was felt that the county assistance agencies should be given the responsibility for determining the need for reviewing eligibility requirements for those receiving assistance from their counties. It was evident that the needs of many persons change slightly from month to month, although health or medical needs may increase or decrease, rents and fuel vary from time to time. On the other hand, many families see great changes, brought about within their family group by the movement of members from one place to an - other, perhaps by the securing of employment, or the hope of securing such employment. In the early days of the program it had been felt that» definite period of time should be set for reviewing the needs of assistance ¦ recipients. For the Old Age Assistance and Blind Assistance groups, such need was to be reviewed every six months, and for the Aid to De - pendent Children group, a review was made every three months. It was decided that while conformity to the legal requirement concerning reviews was necessary,; providing that reinvestigation shall be made on "each case from time to time, and at least once a year and at any time the director of assistance may direct,*' 1 the counties were in a better position to determine where their services might be needed on a selec - tive basis rather than on a purely automatic and arbitrary basis. The policy was revised to conform with this newer philosophy,'and the coun - ties were urged to evaluate carefully the family situation and the" ability of that family to accept responsibility for meeting their own needs. The family was urged to accept the responsibility for reporting to the agency changes in the group which involved increased or decreased needs, either social or economic. . ::" . : !. ,; The impetus that the war activity gave to industry in Nebraska in such areas as Dodge, Saunders, Hall, Adams, Cheyenne and Box Butte Counties, made it particularly necessary that the needs of recipients •Sec. 68-233. 0. S. Supp. 1941. ¦' ¦ 1 </seg>
         <seg id="p008">in those areas be reviewed carefully. The great influx of construction and defense workers into these points brought about such a dearth of housing facilities that it was very evident that the persons in the lower income brackets, particularly recipients of assistance, might find them - selves faced with accepting most inadequate living quarters, if indeed it were possible to find such quarters at all. County assistance staffs were urged to assist these people in finding suitable quarters in the smaller towns in the surrounding area where rents might be lower, or perhaps to arrange for care in the homes of relatives or friends. The cost of food and other commodities increased, and the assist - ance grant purchased less and less. In an effort to meet this rising tide which extended to all counties in Nebraska, the cooperation of the Stata Nutrition Committee and the Department of Foods at the Agricultural College of the University of Nebraska was enlisted in an effort to deter - mine what might be considered an adequate diet which would meet the standards of health and; nutrition. A study was made in ten represent - ative counties in Nebraska to determine the food prices in those areas. While this study was made in November, 1941, the prices were adjusted to the March 1 level and a new food budget was issued at that time. To aid families in using the allowances for food in as economical and pal - atable way as possible, a small booklet of pertinent information relative to the food needs of various individuals, the vitamin groups and their function, some recipes and market orders, was prepared also with the help of the State Nutrition Committee and the Agricultural College. These booklets were distributed to the counties according to the request made by each county, and it was urged that they be used on a selective basis with families who could profit by such material. The booklet was entitled, "Healthful Economical Diets for Everyone," and pointed out that a low cost adequate diet need not be reserved for only those who had insufficient funds to purchase more glamorous foods, but could be adapted to the budgetary needs of any individual who wished to provide a max - imum in nutrition at a minimum of cost. MEDICAL SURVEY The problem of medical care to recipients of assistance has con - cerned the agency for some time. It had been felt that a rather large sum of money was being allowed for medical care which perhaps was not actually providing the care that was needed. Also, it was felt that the problem varied greatly from county to county and that while some counties were extending very good medical services, other counties were showing little recognition of the need for these services. A survey was. made in all counties of the State, after consultation with the represent - atives of the State Medical Association, in order to determine what amounts were actually allowed for medical care in assistance grants, and how much the counties were supplementing assistance grants from county funds for medical care purpose. This survey of November, 1941, covered each case in which a medical allowance was made and 1 asked for information according to the following schedule: 2 </seg>

The material received from the counties was tabulated by the Divi - sion of Research and Statistics, and certain tables get up showing very pertinent information relative to medical care.

It was felt that a different approach to the medical problem should be made and rather than stressing entirely the coat of medical care, that an attempt should be made to provide the best possible medical care to meet the needs of the individual by means of cooperation : and consultation with the physician, the patient and the agency. This 3 </seg>
         <seg id="p010">form was submitted to the counties, who in turn were asked to discuss it with various physicians in the community. The suggestions received as a result of this procedure were incorporated' into the form as it.was finally drafted, and as it is now used by the counties. The emphasis, particularly in ADC incapacity, has been to place the determination of eligibility upon the agency, which, in order to make the decision, will depend upon a physician's report as well as other factors in the case. The matter of the physician's fee is one which is worked out by discus - sion with the physician and the patient, and it is anticipated that this method of operation will provide better medical care for those per - sons who need such care and will enable the physician to be paid for the services which he renders. SELECTIVE SERVICE The relationship between the Selective Service Agency and the De - partment of Assistance and Child Welfare has been extended to include services in a number of areas. The Selective Service regulations have provided that the agency may call upon any other agency for service, and in practically all counties in Nebraska the local selective service board has asked the help of the county assistance agency in determin - ingl dependency, such determination perhaps having a bearing upon in - duction of a man into military service. The Selective Service Agency, as well as our agency, had become concerned over the number of men who were being inducted and who, within a short period of time from the date of induction, suffered men - tal illness which incapacitated them for further military service. It seemed that such persons, perhaps, should never have been inducted into service, and that had information concerning their background been available to the examining board at the point of induction, a clearer determination of their potentialities as soldiers might have been reached. For that reason, a joint plan was worked out with the Selective Service Agency and the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare by which the local boards were encouraged to call upon the local assistance agency for confidential but pertinent information that might be used in evalu - ating the man's mental stability. A form which had been developed with the help of a psychiatrist was provided by the Selective Service Agency, and sets forth the points upon which information is desirable. The local selective service board was asked to request the service of the county assistance agency in writing, and the latter agency would then provide this required information in a confidential report to the local selective service board. It was felt by both agencies that a great deal of good could be derived from this inter-agency relationship, and it was urged that further use be made of this resource. ENEMY ALIENS In the spring ol 1942 when it became necessary to remove great numbers of people from their homes because of the emergency of the war and the various military restrictions which were placed in certain 4 </seg>
         <seg id="p011">areas, the public assistance agencies were given certain responsibilities which are set forth in a publication prepared by the Bureau of Public Assistance of the Social Security Board. We quote: "A. Agencies such as the Army, the Navy, and the Department of Justice are responsible for carrying out the governmental restric - tions necessary for the public safety. They are not equipped to supply service and assistance needed &lt;by individuals as a result of compliance with the restrictive orders. The processes involved are basically associated witfcj the social services and include: Furnish - ing, directly or through referral to the proper source, information needed by aliens and others in order that they, may conform to exist - ing regulations; investigating the needs and available resources of the persons affected; and providing services and assistance needed as a result of removal,: detention, or internment. "B. The Attorney General and, subsequently, the Secretary ol ¦ War .have asked the Federal Security Administrator, as Director . of Defense Health and Welfare Services, to undertake on their be - half the task of facilitating the transfer of enemy aliens and others from designated areas, of relocating and reestablishing such persons in appropriate places and activities, and of making services and assistance available to the dependents of persons who are detained, interned, or removed from designated areas. ¦ "C. In allocating funds to the Federal Security Administrator for carrying oiit the plan, the President indicated that he would like the program to be administered within the framework of existing regular agencies. The Social Security. Board, in planning to dis - charge its responsibilities, expects in most instances to ask State agencies administering public assistance: programs to act in its ¦¦¦" behalf to provide the services and assistance that are necessary to assure the objectives of the protective actions taken by the Govern - .¦•'¦¦. ment. This type of Federal, State, and local cooperation is regard - . Ed as necessary in order to conserve and strengthen the basic social ¦¦¦¦.: services that are an essential part of the country^ resources to maintain morale. , This type of.. shared responsibility is likewise necessary if the Government is to be successful in the application of restrictive measures that will be consistent with the philosophy of the democracies and that, by including specific provision for justice to individuals, will prevent mass injustice."2 Plans are still in the making in Nebraska to provide such services to people who are in need of them. Up to July 1,1942, there had been only one request for such service which, upon investigation, was found to have a need which could best be met from other resources. FIELD REVIEWS Field Reviews, in which the administration of the assistance pro - gram in the counties is studied, have been made in twenty-three coontlw in the past year. These studies, when written up by the Field Reviewer, are used us a basis for improving the administration within the county and offering a means by which further help may be given to the coun - ties by the Field Supervisors. 'PoliclM and Procedures Govarninr the Administration of Services to Ennay AUras AHecttd by Gtvmmutil Action, Bureau al Public As«UUne», 8&lt;wl«l B» - --curity Board. ' '. ..' 5 </seg>
         <seg id="p012">Special studies were made in several counties in which it was neces - sary to determine the facts in a particular area within that county. For instance, two former poor farms were studied to determine whether or not they met the qualifications of private institutions rather than public institutions, and whether or not recipients of assistance living in those institutions might be eligible for State and Federal funds. Tihe emphasis on the field review is gradually changing to include more of the special type of study. Such a study may be requested by the Field Supervisor, by the county director, or perhaps by the State De - partment, and will serve as a basis for the, development of future pol - icies and procedures in the Department. CASE CORRESPONDENCE The correspondence section continues to handle letters of a general nature such as inquiries regarding residence, eligibility, the status of ap - plication and general activities of the Department, as well as complaint letters. Inquiries concerning child welfare are referred to that Division. The Case Correspondent also interviews persons interested in obtaining information about the program and individuals wishing to discuss their own problems, often referring them back to the assistance director in their own county for further help. Inter-agency correspondence is routed through the Case Corres - pondence Section, and the policy of routing all requests for reviews on out-of-State Aid to Dependent Children cases has aided in establishing better understanding between State agencies. In the spring of 1942, it was decided to make a study of the number of assistance recipients who were living outside the State of Nebraska although continuing to receive their assistance grants .from Nebraska. As a result of this study, it was found that some 650 recipients of assist - ance are residing in other States. California leads with 134 persons living in that State and receiving assistance from Nebraska. Colorado is next with 59 persons, while lowa, Missouri and Oregon have approx - imately 40 persons each. The balance of the 550 persons are residing in 37 States in the Union. For the purpose of comparison, the number of reviews requested of Nebraska counties by other States was checked. It was found that a total of 64 requests had been made through the State Correspondence Section. However, this figure cannot be considered conclusive since some requests may have been sent directly to the county agencies or to the individuals personally. Because of transportation problems, it was decided in June of 1942 to restrict the services of the county staffs by not making routine rel - ative visits for other States. It is still our policy, however, to make home visits in situations involving circumstances other than the financial situation of the relative. A very interesting phase of the work of this section was added dux - ing the year when the Board of Control appointed the Chief of the Divi- 6 </seg>
         <seg id="p013">sion of Public Assistance to act as deportation agent for the Board. Frequently residents of Nebraska become ill while in other States, and if it becomes necessary to admit such individuals to State institutions as non-residents, the State in which they are admitted will ask for their transfer to a Nebraska institution. Correspondence is initiated to es - tablish residence in Nebraska and to secure authorization from the county to return the patient to the State. Up to the present time, all cases handled have involved mental illness. Our suggestion to the county of residence, therefore, has been that the patient be returned to the proper institution where commitment can be made by the local in - sanity board and charges transferred to the county of residence. This method is much less disturbing to the patient and his family, and less expensive for the county since additional transportation costs will be cut as well as the need for custodial care in the county. When a trans - fer is made to a hospital in Nebraska from another State, the Nebraska institution is notified that they may expect the patient, and the Board of Control is given a brief summary of the case. Frequently this same problem arises in respect to residents of other States who hare been committed to our State institutions. The Case Correspondent, in such cases, endeavors to secure authorization from the State of residence to return the patient. . .: :'¦¦"' Approximately one-third of the cases handled have been those of soldiers who have been found by Army physicians to be mentally ill and, therefore, incapacitated for military service. Occasionally after treat - ment and care in an Army hospital, a soldier is released to his own care, but the majority of the cases have been transferred from Army hospitals to a designated hospital in Nebraska for further care. The Government finances the expense of the transfers, and soldiers are returned with proper attendants. .'.- . '. • . :- In some instances the Red Cross Chapter in the soldier's community has been notified of the illness of the soldier, and his family has been visited by their Home Service Representative. Often, however, the first knowledge comes through the assistance visitor who visits the family in order to establish residence. This problem is closely allied to the services which the assistance agency may give the Selective Service Agency, as mentioned earlier in this report, and which, it is hoped, may prevent the induction of mentally unstable persons. :\:J,-[ :¦...¦' ¦;¦¦ COLLECTIONS The Nebraska law provides for a claim to be filed against the, estate of a deceased recipient of Old Age Assistance for the total amount of assistance received by him during his lifetime. The claim is not en - forced against the real estate of a person who has been a recipient white it is occupied by a surviving spouse, or by a dependent child of the de - ceased recipient or the surviving spouse. The claim for assistance is filed against the estate by the county treasurer when he is directed to do. so by the county board. The claim for assistance is not a preferred 7 </seg>
         <seg id="p014">claim, but may be allowed by the court as a general claim. The amount recovered is sent directly to the State Treasurer to be credited to the State Assistance Fund. Under both State and Federal law, one-half of the amount recovered is paid to the United States Government. While it is the responsibility of the county board) to take the initia - tive in making recovery, the county assistance director cooperates by submitting to the board a list of the names; of the deceased recipients, together with information in each case which would be helpful to the board in its consideration of whether or not recovery is possible. The mechanical procedure for making recovery has been outlined in detail in the State Manual, and consultative service is available to the counties on individual cases presenting unusual circumstances. In the past year, collections have averaged almost $1,000 each month, or a total of $11, - ---156.15 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1942. (See Statistical Table No. 40.) While the amount recovered is not large; on the basis of the overage Old Age Assistance grant of $18.96 for the fiscal year 1941 - ---1942, the assistance payments made to forty-nine recipients each month were paid from the collections received from recoveries. SPECIAL BLIND PROGRAM During the period from July 1,1941 through June 30,1942, seventeen applications for funds to prevent blindness or restore eyesight have been approved. These persons have accepted surgery or treatment which in many instances has improved their sight and enabled them to care for themselves or continue their normal duties. At the end of the fiscal year, eighteen applications were pending. It is felt that this program could be extended to include a younger group of persons who could benefit from the service offered. Most of the applicants for this service up to this time have ibeen in the older age group, and the condition which has caused blindness in most instances has been that of cataract. It is anticipated that developments in the coming year will extend this service to a younger group with more far - reaching results. REVISION OF THE STATE MANUAL Revision of the Manual for the Division of Public Assistance was planned early in 1942, but owing to lack of personnel was not begun mi - til April of this year. At that time a member of the Field Service staff was relieved of field supervisor duties and was brought into the State Department office on a special assignment to rewrite the Manual. : The project was later enlarged to include a revision and restatement of the State Plan, the original description of which written in 1038, had not been altered except through the addition of the State Manual, bul - letins, memoranda and administrative letters. These bulletins, memo - randa and administrative letters represented changes in procedure, new policies and, in general, the growth and development of the program, but 8 </seg>
         <seg id="p015">it was impracticable to incorporate them in the Plan itself. A farther difficulty was that the several methods' of issuing instmctjoiw in regard to program changes caused dißpersion of this material through both State and county flies to such an extent that it wbb impossible for the Sate Department to present a clear picture of its plan of operation. The Director of Assistance and the Division Chiefs were keenly aware of the situation and, after conferences with representatives of the Social Security Board, decided, as a group, to adopt a new form of State Plan which would also include a complete system of manuals. The 'total document, when completed, would constitute the State Plan and would show functions and current operation of all divisions of the State Department of Assistance and Child Welfare. Each division was to be responsible for a statement of its standards and practices. A uniform form and a central control of issuance and revision were agreed upon, with the use of loose-leaf binders and a coding device for ready refer - ences and ease of expansion and revision. A further development was the agreement by the Division of Public Assistance and the Division of Child Welfare and Services for Crippled Children that all instructions to the county agencies should be coor - dinated and organized on the basis ot function rather than separated by program. This would; mean that the requirements for all programs in regard to certain conditions of eligibility or case study as, for example, age or residence, would be grouped under that heading, and nowhere else in the Manual would there be any discussion of these points. This plan of organization for manuals had been used successfully in other States. Ifi represented for the Nebraska Department of Assist - ance and Child Welfare a logical development of the idea of unified ad - ministration begun by the adoption of the policy of supervision through a unified field staff. The plan had the further desirable goal of bringing the total area of State agency responsibility into focus as a whole, and of showing it as a unit) of closely knit and interlocking activities, with economy and efficiency of administration, and coordinated services to the people whose needs the agency must meet, as its aim. The first step in working but the project was the development of a plan for organizing the material which was to constitute the "State Plan and System of Manuals." After this part of the work was completed, the second step was the development of that part of the document which was to be used as a manual in the county agencies. The title selected was "Standards and Practices for the Administration of Assistance and Services." Once the plan of organization for this Manual had been com - pleted the Director of Assistance had it submitted to a group of repre - sentative county assistance directors. Their opinions and comments were requested because they were the ones who would use the material and who would give practical suggestions about it. Their approval was unanimous and they offered many useful suggestions. From that point this Manual has developed as planned. 9 </seg>
         <seg id="p016">The working out of many problems of coordination and clarification of responsibility is still under way. The policy of consulting the county assistance directors, field supervisors, and others' who will use the ma - terial continues. The Division of Public Assistance is taking responsi - bility for handling administrative detail, but all material is reviewed and approved by the Divisions concerned. The cooperation of all the Divisions of the State Department has been notable and each has made contributions to the Manual and to the State Plan as a whole. The Di - rector of Assistance has given close attention to the development of tho project and has guided it from its beginning, and representatives of the Social Security Board have offered the benefit of their experience and advice. FEDERAL PROGRAMS Civilian Conservation Corps On July 1, 1941, there were ten CCC camps located in Nebraska with an enrollment of 1,081 Nebraska juniors. However, increase in oppor - tunities for employment, induction under the Selective Service Act and enlistments in the Army and Navy brought about a sharp decline in en - rollment. A careful study of enrollment procedures in effect July, 1941, indicat - ed the necessity of substituting continuous enrollment in lieu of the peri - odic enrollment Local State Employment Offices were authorized to refer applicants to nearby camps or to county selecting agents for enrollment, and camp officials were authorized to cooperate with the local CCC selecting agency, which was solely responsible for certifying the eligibil - ity of the candidates and for disposition of the allotment or deposit in ac - cordance with law and established regulations. In February, 1942, new pay schedules were adopted by which enrollees with dependents received $12.00 in cash each month, were required to de - posit $8.00 with the Finance Officer, and allotted $10.00 to their depend - ents. Enrollees without dependents received $12.00 a month in cash and were required to deposit §18.00 with the Finance Officer. It was during this month, also, that camps which could not qualify under the two major divisions of the war-time CCC work and training programs were closed as rapidly as possible. On June 30,1942, there were but 109 Nebraska juniors enrolled in CCC, and on July 1, 1942, Congress enacted legislation calling for the liquida - tion of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Enrollments were discontinued immediately and camps disbanded. The CCC, through its program of healthful work for the young men and boys, made a unique place for itself during a particularly difficult period in economic and social history. Probably few organizations re - ceived tho approval and acclaim of the public that CCC has received. The purpose of this program was served, and when other events turned 10 </seg>
         <seg id="p017">the score from "unwanted youth" to a great need for all available man - power, the CCC job was completed. The training received by the thousands of youth has been invaluable in the transition from peace to war-time activities in civilian and military life. Work Projects Administration The county agencies of the Department of Assistance and Child Wel - fare are still responsible for accepting applications for WPA employ - ment, determining eligibility and presenting the material by-way of re - ferral to the WPA Division of Employment. WPA projects in many counties have been discontinued due to lack of need for such employment. Applications for employment on WPA, however, are accepted and assign - ments are made to the already existing projects which are still in opera - tion. A noticeable decline in such applications has been felt in the past year due to the great demand for labor in the defense industries and ag - ricultural areas. Qualifications for eligibility to WPA are set up by that agency and have been modified only slightly in the past year.: WPA employees have been urged to offer their services where they are needed, and the United States Employment Service has been largely instrumental in making placements in private industry. National Youth Administration NYA experienced considerable reduction in their projects during the past year, with the emphasis being maintained on defense training pro - jects. Machine shops, radio and welding, have been established on the resident projects, and a number of youth who have accepted such train - ing have been able to secure employment in other States in defense indus - tries. Girls have been encouraged to accept NYA defense training, and have been fairly successful in securing employment in that area. The Congress in session has indicated its intention to reduce NYA still further, and many changes in the administrative aspect of the pro - gram may be expected. Referrals are still made from county assistance agencies to NYA, although the greater number of applications for NYA employment are received directly by the National Youth Administration. 11 </seg>

Section 08-324 of the Compiled Statutes and as amended by L. B. No. 399 effec - tive May 23, 1941, provides that this amount shall be divided as follows: 1.

From October 1941 through April 1942 all grants were paid in full on the basis of need. Although one-half the amount appropriated for the biennium would amount to $5,098,000.00 the sources of revenue produced an amount greater than estimated by nearly $300,000.00. Therefore the expendi - tures were increased by increasing the per cent paid to Old Age and Aid to Dependent Children Assistance recipients from 87% to 90% during the months of April, May, and June 1942. The receipts of State Funds during this period, exclusive of the previous balances carried forward, amounted to $5,112,826.73.

Eligible participants purchase Orange Food Stamps wbich they may use to purchase any foods for human consumption not con - sumed on the store premises. With each dollar of Orange Food Stamps they purchase, the Federal Government gives them fifty cents ¦worth of 19 </seg>
         <seg id="p026">Free Blue Stamps. The Free Blue Stamps given by the government may be used to buy only those foods designated by the Secretary of Agri - culture each month. Generally, all households eligible to receive some form of public assistance are eligible to participate in the Stamp Plan, certain exceptions exist depending upon total household income and size of family. All certifications are made by the County Assistance Office in accordance with rules of eligibility and minimum purchase require - ments established by the Agricultural Marketing Administration. The State Mail-Order Food Stamp Plan now being operated by the State Assistance Department was developed as a means of distributing Food Stamps to individuals by mail. Outside of the "across the connter" sales in Douglas County, all participants certified to the State Stamp Is - suing Office must purchase their Food Stamps by mail from the State Stamp Issuing Office in Lincoln. The Stamps are then sent to the clients through the mail. The Food Stamp Plan was put in operation in Nebraska in February, 1940. Lancaster County was the first county to adopt the plan. Other counties, seeing the advantages of the Food Stamps over the direct dis - tribution of commodities, soon adopted the stamp plan also. In July, 1941, thirty-eight counties were operating the Food Stamp Plan in their counties. The State Mail-Order Food Stamp Plan was opened in Nebraska July 15, 1941 with 33 counties designated as open and eligible to participate in the plan. Early in August, 19 additional counties were opened making a total of 52. The Mail-Order Plan of distribution was made available to all counties but especially to those counties not operating their own local disbursing office. In November, 1941, the Nuckolls County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution asking to change to the State Mail-Order Plan of distribution and the first stamps were distributed in November. In December, 1941, Douglas County passed a similar reso - lution and the State Stamp Issuing Office took over the sale of Food Stamps in Douglas County on December 16. In March, 1942, 6 other counties changed over to the Mail Plan, in April, 2 counties, May, 7 counties, and in June, 10 counties, making a total of 79 counties operating under the State Mail Plan, and 12 counties operating their own Stamp Issuing Office. Two counties in the state do not have the Food Stamp Plan. In Nebraska a total of $4,013,340 in Orange and $2,006,670 in Free Blue Stamps were distributed during the fiscal year 1941-1942. Of this amount, $1,361,171 in Orange and $680,585.60 in Free Blue Stamps were distributed by the State Mail Order Plan of distribution and $2,652,169 in Orange and $1,326,084.50 in Free Blue Stamps were distributed by the counties operating their own disbursing office.

         <seg id="p030">DIVISION OF RESEARCH AND STATISTICS The Division of Research and Statistics collects the data on case - loads, obligations incurred, and the time spent by the county personnel on the various programs. These in turn are consolidated, transcribed, and sent to the Social Security Board in Washington to serve as a sta - tistical background for Federal participation in the State program. It must also make studies of various subjects for the other divisions, the Board of Control, and the Social Security Board. It should evaluate the economic trends and try to forsee their effect upon the programs administered. From such deductions it must try to forecast, when called upon, the probable future situations of these programs. The events of the fiscal year 1941-42 are of such magnitude, and the repercussions on civilian life so great that it is with exceeding cau - tion that the Division of Research and Statistics approaches the prob - lem of forecasting the probable caseloads of many of the various pro - grams upon which it is required to report. The factor of migration, which until recently was a constant outflow of the younger, more or less skilled -workers, has become more confused with the location of various war industries in Nebraska, bringing in workers from outside the state. The census bureau estimates that over 71,000 have left the state since 1940 exclusive of an estimated 66,000 in the armed forces. To what extent this has been replaced with incoming workers is problematical. What the ages of these 71,000 persons might be, what affect jobs and further employment might have on the assistance rolls, and what jobs are appearing into which the groups administered under the Social Security programs might fit, makes toward more confusion. It would seem on the surface that soldiers' allotments, better economic positions of relatives, better farm prices would have the effect of decreasing the present caseloads in the Social Security programs. There has been in the past an almost constant increase in the num - ber of old-age assistance clients, and while the rate of increase may have decreased during summer months, and an occasional month has shown a small decrease from the previous month, this upward trend has been constant since the inception of the present program in 1936. In March, 1942, the present peak of the old-age assistance caseload was reached. This was 29,766. Since March the trend each month has shown a de - creased load. While it is true the June, 1942, caseload of 29,658 was 617 above the June caseload of 1941, yet for the first time there has been a definite trend of a downward nature over a period of four months. How long this will go on is, of course, not known. Yet if the rolls con - tinue to decrease at the rate established from March, 1942, to June 1942, by June 1943 the caseload would be approximately 28,000. The rate 24 </seg>
         <seg id="p031">established from March to June, however, may be far greater than the rate of decrease during the winter months. Another factor to be consid - ered is the increasing numbers of persons reaching 65 years of age. The effect of this increase should tend to offset the rather rapid decline in assistance cases which have sesponded quickest to the economic upturn. It might be said the number of cases removed will not be accelerated but rather slowed down as winter, more persons reaching 65 yean of age, and the cases easiest affected by economic conditions, are taken into consideration. Thus, as the Division watches the impact of various factors combining to increase or decrease the caseload, it must turn to other indications to justify a prediction of 28,000 old-age assistance clients by June, 1943. On July Ist, 1941, there were 1,162 applications pending, while on July 1,1942, this number had decreased 43% to 803. This fact is not sufficient in itself to be of much value since more ef - ficient and quicker action on these applications during the fiscal year may be the answer. Yet, as the new applications are analyzed, a grad - ual drop is noticed so that by July 1942, 270 new applications were re - ceived. This represents a drop of 40% below the number received in July, 1941. While this is a simple comparison of two months, yet the trend in new applications during the year has been downward. Thus, it would seem these last two factors are the significant reflections of the times and would indicate that the forecast of 28,000, and not to exceed 28,600 cases under the present circumstances, would be quite reliable. Whether these rolls will increase within the next few years depends on the length of the war and the time and ability of the civilian population to prepare for the tramition once again to the economics of a postwar world, whatever they may be. The aid to dependent children's program reflects economic condi - tions to a greater extent than does the old-age assistance program. In July 1941 this caseload consisted of 6,765 families and 12,914 children. By June 1942 the load had decreased to 5,406 families and 12,087 chil - dren. While the successive months presented erratic fluctuations, yet the secular or long-time trend has progressed steadily upward since the program began in 1936. In June 1941, however, this upward direction came to a halt, and since that time or during the last fiscal year, the trend has been toward a constantly decreasing monthly caseload. While it may be still too early to say that the longtime trend of the program is now downward, it has at least been definitely stopped for a time in its upward swing. There is little cause to believe that during the coming year this downward trend will not continue. As a matter of fact, at the present rate of decrease the caseload of June 1943, it is estimated, should he about 4,500 families and 10,000 children. Regarding aid to dependent children it is well to point out that during the past year due to legal limitations of $18 for first child and $12 for each additional child, the minimum needs of a large percentage of these cases have not been met. Thus it must be realized that consid - erable improvement in the family's economic situations must be secured before the family can become ineligible for the grants. As a gauge to 25 </seg>
         <seg id="p032">what the present thinking ia, the soldiers' allotment provides |62 for mother and child against the aid to dependent children legal maximum of ?18 for the two and $72 for a mother and two children against the aid to dependent children legal maximum of $30. Most of the serious situ - ations among the cases in the aid to dependent children caseload are among these two types of families. Thus, it becomes necessary for the counties to supplement a considerable sum of county money in order that minimum food, shelter, and clothing requirements are at least ap - proached. : Aid to the blind program is a fairly stable one and an increase of only thirteen persons has been made during the present fiscal year. Under these circumstances the caseload of 729 persons in June 1942 will be little changed in June 1943. There is a possibility, however, that certain vocations in which the blind become peculiarly adept due to their disability may allow some persons now on the rolls to become self-sup - porting. Beside this possibility the state does provide in its program "For Prevention of Blindness and Restoration of Sight" a means by which some of the types of blindness susceptible to medical and surgical relief can be helped. Thirteen persons were so helped during the past fiscal year. The programs which used Federal money only for payments to clients are at a low ebb. The Works Progress Administration program which took care of the employable relief load, which in July 1941 was 13,482, by June 1942 had 5,225 on its rolls. How much further this load can be reduced is dependent upon the ability of the individual to work in private industry under the pressure of the war. It is notable that the average age of the workers on WPA is over 50 years. The National Youth Administration, which geared itself to war work, passed out of the picture as a relief agency in July 1942, and as such no longer need be commented upon. The same situation appears as to the Civilian Con - servation Corps. Here, however, the entire program is being liquidated. The Farm Security Administration, facing a lack of money for payment of grants, dropped these grants from 478 in July 1941 to 14 in July 1942, although there were 250 grants made in June 1942. Little if any activity can be expected in this program during the next year under: present circumstances. In the programs paid for from county funds, General Relief, 1 which is larger than all other county paid programs combined both as to coses and obligations incurred, is a program which is distinctly seasonal in nature. Winter and cold weather with lack of seasonal work increases the caseload, while summer and warmer days causes It to decline. In June 1941, this caseload was 5,776. In June 1942 this was 4,411. The large drop in caseload in the year 1940-1641 over previous years was not continued during 1941-1942, although considerable drop was no - ticed. On the basis of such a situation it is entirely possible that the 'This does not include medical, hospitalization, burial or transient aid. 26 </seg>
         <seg id="p033">General Belief caseload may lie Hearing 1 stabilization and that "work in vocational training and considerable individual counseling may be nec - essary so that these persons can be fitted to make a more permanent readjustment which will call for less and less assistance. It is an un - escapable fact that proper medical attention in time would have elim - inated many of these cases whose present incapacity can be traced di - rectly to lack of medical care at a time when the disease was curable. It is almost too late to save many of such cases now 1 but the continued addition of such cases to permanent relief rolls can be eliminated. This opens up a field worth considering. ...'¦... . ; . The remaining county programs, Mothers' Pension, Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief, and County Blind, are well stabilized programs that pre - sent about the same problems each year! Mothers' Pension is a program spending between $150,000 and $200,000 a year. Much of this money could have Federal matching if the method of administrative control could be changed. This would be of immense value in helping to over - come deficiencies occurring in the Aid to Dependent Children's program due to legal limitations. County Blind, representing fewer than ten cases for the most part, is a very small program. Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief, however, faces a new situation growing out of the present war which has the earmarks of being longer, bloodier, and more far-reach - ing than the hut. It might be well that some agency be allowed to col - lect complete data on present veteran's county programs so that the statistical background of those programs can be analyzed in the face of future developments. To date no such agency exists. This Division receives data from only such counties as care to give it. Its coverage is about 80%. In conclusion it can be generally stated that the Social Security programs in which Federal and State money is spent shows signs of declining to at least 1940-1941 levels. The Federal programs spending Federal money only, instead of being major programs, are declining to a minor position or no longer exist. The county programs spending county money only are becoming stabilized at present levels. Thus, it would seem to point to a gradual withdrawal of Federal agencies from the field due to the war and better economic conditions and leaving, ex - cept in the case of the Social Security programs, the maintenance of re - lief a local responsibility. The reporting of child welfare services, while equally as important a part of this Division's duties, is made through the Divisions of Child Welfare and Crippled Children's Services. Because of this fact the statistics and analysis are included in the report of tiione Divisions. The experience of England and Canada, as well as other of our allies, hat been that these services for children increase rapidly during war tinw. This Division believes that Nebraska and the United States may be no exception.:.. !. .\[--:.'_ ;'¦¦'¦''.;.'. .'. '-.'.:., 27 </seg>

         <seg id="p094">DIVISION OF PERSONNEL Continued progress has been made in the selection of personnel on a merit basis and the application of the Regulations for a Merit System of Personnel Administration. The problems of recruiting and retaining personnel for the Department have been intensified by the extraordinary conditions created by the war. Turnover of personnel has been extreme - ly high, making it difficult to maintain the standards of efficiency estab - lished by the organization. One of the most serious problems confronting the Department of State Assistance and Child Welfare is that of stabil - izing its personnel. During the past year the merit regulations have been amended to expedite the selection of new personnel and to make the most effective use of present personnel through transfers, promo - tions and salary advancements. The Merit System Council, through the Merit System Supervisor, has improved the examination technique and has been able to give ex - aminations more often. The examination arrangements for clerical posi - tions have been improved in such a manner as to permit tha candidate to complete the total examination in one day where formerly the candi - date was required to return a second day. Continuous study and re - search is being carried on to improve the examination technique, so that the best qualified persons will be secured. The second series of exam - inations was given during the year for six of the professional classes and three of the clerical classes. Promotional examinations, limited to employees of the agency, were given for the positions of Senior Visitor, County Director II and 111. The first series of examinations for the positions of Medical Social Worker, Medical Social Work Supervisor and Public Health Nursing Consultant-Orthopedics were offered daring, the past year. The demand for qualified personnel by Federal agencies, other state agencies, and private industries has materially reduced the supply of applicants. '.'¦ The registers for the higher classes of positions have become ex - hausted more rapidly than those for the clerical and other lower classes of positions. The clerical registers established in June 1942, under normal conditions would have been sufficiently large to meet the agency's needs. However, as a result of the original canvass of availability, this register was reduced by approximately 50%. In view of this initial re - duction of available candidates, it is anticipated that there will be a shortage of available clerical personnel in many sections of the State before another examination can be offered. The original register for any class of position includes the names of all persons who passed the examination, arranged in order of their 88 </seg>
         <seg id="p095">final grades. In accordance with the merit system regulations, the ap - pointing authority has the privilege of selecting an employee from the three highest available persons on toe original register. In addition, the county appointing authority (the County Assistance Committee) has the privilege of selecting an employee from the three highest available persons on either the local or State-wide register. This usually permits a selection for each vacancy from six available applicants, except in cases where individuals may be at the top of both State and county registers. The local register originally consists of persons available in a specific county. If less than-three persons are available in the county, names of persons on thef district register are made available. The process of clearing the availability of candidates for employment has been speeded up as a result of an amendment which provides that if a candidate does not reply to a telegram within 48 hours, he may be considered as not available. In spite of current canvassing of registers by the 1 Merit Sys - tem Supervisor many candidates are found not to be available when of - fered definite employment.; : A certain amount of turnover in personnel in any agency is whole - some and desirable, for this condition fosters merited promotions and permits the recruiting of new persons from outside the organisation. What the desirable rate of turnover should be is not known but it is questionable whether the large turnover during the past year is reason - able or wholesome. The work of the Department has been affected by the changes in staff which caused vacancies' for various periods of time and required much time for orienting new employees to their jobs. As shown in Table 2, 229 employees with permanent status resigned their positions during the year. Twenty-six were granted educational, military and other leaves. Eight other employees with permanent status were sep - arated from the service due to dismissal, death, or transfer to other agen - cies operating under the merit system. Table 1 reveals that 168 employees were recruited through probationary appointments. Sixteen employees having permanent status were reinstated, 11 were returned from leave, and one was secured by transfer from another agency. An additional 49 employees were recruited on a provisional basis, most of whom have quali - fied by examination and later received probationary appointments. Dis - regarding the numerous additions and separations of employees on pro - visional, temporary and emergency appointments made during the year, the turnover of the regular personnel was slightly over 40 per cent. This percentage is based on an average number of 603 positions for the twelve-month period. In several instances two or ;more replacements were made for the same position. The seriousness of this situation is modified somewhat by the fact that the Department has been able to xeduce its staff from a total of 633 on July 1, 1941 to 569 on June SO, 1&amp;42. This reduction of M reflects to some extent the reduction in the caseloads served by the county assistance agencies. ¦; ¦ y 1:-. .nH"; ¦¦- ':".. The loss of personnel by the Department has been cushioned some - what through promotions. The minimum qualifications of education and 89 </seg>
         <seg id="p096">experience for each position establishes a definite and orderly scheme of promotions and salary advancements. During the year ©7 employees were promoted to higher positions. (See Table 3) These .promotions were distributed between both clerical and professional classes. Several of those employees promoted would have left the employ of the Depart - ment if promotion had not been forthcoming. In all but ten cases the employee promoted received an increase in salary. The number of pro - motions made during the current year exceeded by,, twice the number - made during the preceding year. The appointing authorities have given preference to applicants eligible for promotion when vacancies occur. Salary adjustments granted to personnel, together with revisions in the basic compensation schedule for some positions, have further served to retard the turnover of personnel. Many counties, especially those where ordnance plants, air fields and defense industries have been devel - oped, have made upward revisions of compensation schedules. These revisions have been made in accordance with merit regulations and were necessary to secure qualified personnel. Notwithstanding the desire of many county agencies to recognize the service) rendered by satisfactory employees by granting salary advancements, the agency in many cases found it impossible to meet the competition created by the attractive salaries being offered by other employers. More than half of the salary advancements granted by this agency amounted to two or more normal steps, which illustrates the keenness of outside competition. Various methods of recruiting qualified personnel and better equip - ping present personnel through an in-service training program have been used by the agency. Educational stipends from Federal Funds were grantad to a limited number of the agency's employees in order that they might secure further training and thereby be qualified for higher professional positions. Many of the new Visitors employed by the Department attended a four-week intensive training course at an orientation center operated by the state agency. A three-day training institute was given during the year under the joint auspices of the State University and the Department of State Assistance and- Child Welfare. A total of 114 persons, representing 61 counties, attended the institute. Of this number 32 were County Assistance Directors, 76 were Visitors and 6 held other technical positions in the county offices. Many em - ployees who could not arrange for formal schooling were able to take advantage of this training. The response to this institute clearly re-' veals the need of a formal in-service training program. Closely related with the in-service training program of the Department has been the preliminary work in the preparation of standards of performance for the Visitor's position. By these standards the agency plans to develop a tool to be used in staff development. Standards of performance for all po - sitions will eventually be completed and a service rating form instituted for evaluating the performance of the personnel. Service ratings shall be considered in determining salary advancements and in making,pro - motions, demotions, dismissals, and in determining the order of separa- 90 </seg>
         <seg id="p097">tions due to redaction ot force. Employment under the merit system guarantees an individual definite employment if he continues to perform satisfactorily on the job. The agency may dismiss any employee who is negligent or inefficient in his duties; the dismissed employee may file an appeal with the Merit System Council for a fair hearing. Adequate procedures have been established to provide both the employee and the agency an opportunity to present its case before an impartial tribunal. The merit system regulations provide that each agency shall adopt regulations covering attendance, vacation, sick leave, other types of Jeaye, and any other policy affecting agency personnel. In accordance with the above regulations, the Board of Control has adopted formal personnel policies for the Department of State Assistance and Child Welfare which are binding upon the counties.* Employees appreciate knowing definitely how personnel policies affect them as individuals. Formal adoption of personnel policies has resulted in improved staff morale. Three amendments pertaining to the probationary period have been adopted iby, the participating agencies and approved by the Social Se - curity Board and the United States Children's Bureau. Originally all preference employees who had been employed with the Department since November, 1939 were required to serve a probationary period after qual - ifying for their positions by passing an appropriate examination. An employee who is on probation is not eligible for a salary advancement. Due to the.competition from other employers who could offer greater compensation, the Department was faced with the loss of personnel if the regulations were not modified. Accordingly an amendment was ap - proved whereby preference employees were automatically granted per - manent status upon making a qualifying grade in their examination. The Department was able to retain several of these employees by making salary adjustments. Another amendment has shortened the probationary period from six months to three months for the two lowest stenographic and clerical po - sitions, Junior Stenographer and Typist-Clerk. This has made it pos- 1 sible for employees in these classifications to obtain permanent status after a short period of time and the agency has been in a position to re - tain these employees through salary adjustments, promotions and trans - fers. . I ¦ ..... . , .¦¦:'-.:¦;¦ A third amendment has extended the use of the probationary pro - cess by providing that an employee who is promoted to an advanced po - sition be required to serve a second probationary period. This provision furthers the opportunity for the agency to provide a career service for its employees. The agency may now promote an employee to a higher position for which be meets minimum qualifications with the safeguard of being able to return the employee to his former position. This period affords the employee an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to per - ! »«8-»2, Compiled Statutes, Mebnsks, Supplement 1939. 91 </seg>
         <seg id="p098">form iis new duties satisfactorily and at the same time gives the agency an opportunity to evaluate his performance. The agency may now ex - ercise more freedom in making promotions because the second probation - ary period makes it unnecessary to retain the employee in. the advanced, position unless he demonstrates fully his ability to perform the required duties. Protection is afforded to the employee as he may return to his former position if he does not prove satisfactory in the one to which he is promoted. Further revisions of the merit regulations have been recommended to the Federal agencies but to date these have been rejected. One such amendment provides for the use of agency personnel in supervisory posi-; tions serving: on oral examination boards when examinations are held for positions on the county level. Another suggested amendment would permit the time served on a 1 provisional basis to apply on the probation - ary period. When adequate registers are not available and it is neces - sary to make provisional appointments this provision would facilitate the recruitment of personnel by making it possible for the employee to secure permanent status in a shorter period of time. Further efforts will be made to secure the approval of the Federal agencies to these amend - ments. 92 </seg>

         <seg id="p103">DIVISION OF FIELD SERVICES The Division of Field Services of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare consists of a chief of staff, twelve field supervisors, supervisor of orientation center, and stenographers. Its function is to promote uniformly high standards of administration throughout the State in accordance with policies and procedures established in the Divisions, as formulated or approved by the Director of Assistance, under the general direction of the Board of Control. ' For purposes of supervision, the State is divided into twelve dis - tricts, each consisting of from five to eleven counties, with a field super - visor responsible for each district (See Division of Field Services, Map 1). The field supervisors make their headquarters in district offices located at Grand Island, Norfolk, North Platte, Lincoln, Scottsbluff, O'Neill, and Omaha. In each of the first three cities mentioned, two supervisors have their headquarters office together. There are three located at Lincoln. Due to the reduction in case load it has been possible to reduce the number of districts during the past year from thirteen to twelve. ¦ The field supervisor serves as liaison officer between the State Department and the County Assistance Committees and staffs in his district. He interprets to the local agencies the State laws, policies and procedures and interprets to the State office personnel the problems encountered by the local staffs in their application. He provides direct supervision in all matters (except fiscal) pertaining to the local admin - istration of Old Age Assistance, Blind Assistance, Aid to Dependent Children, Child Welfare and Crippled Children's Services, and supervises directly the county. assistance directors who serve as agents for the State office in the local administration of the certification and referral program for federal agencies.- In this hitter program the local agencies handle applications and make investigations to determine eligibility for WPA and School Lunch programs and the Civilian Conservation Corps. •'"._:.' -'.':¦¦¦;¦&gt;¦ :'•¦'•"¦'.'.'¦? ,: " ' ¦";-:. -."'. .'¦'•',..'-: '¦ '*. ¦ ¦'¦¦¦' The field supervisor visits each county assistance office in his district regularly each month and of tener if necessary. He offers assistance to the local staff with problems of general administration including per - sonnel selection and practices and problems involved in determining' initial eligibility, of applicants and determining continued: eligibility of recipients. He also represents the State office as a certifying agent. He reviews routinely all new applications, re-applications, re-openings, and closings and reads a sampling of the modifications for the three assistance categories. He approves or disapproves the county committee's action in these applications and cases. If there' is disagreement between 97 </seg>
         <seg id="p104">the field supervisor and the county assistance committee the case is referred to the State office for decision. This procedure of certifying applications and cases in the county office has contributed to the efficiency of the program generally, since it provides opportunity for clearing up questions without delay and furnishes an excellent basis for supervisory conferences. The various divisions of the State office are kept informed regarding the problems and progress of the county offices through the use of regular and special reports from the field staff. The field supervisor plays an important role in the evaluation of all county programs for which the Department has responsibility. Staff Development: The field supervisor is responsible for stimulating and promoting staff development activities in his district. In addition to the regular day-by-day supervision which is the essential feature of the Department's staff development program, the field supervisors have conducted informal small study groups of local assistance workers. They stimulate local staff meetings, professional reading, and other in-service training projects. The supervisors also attend and participate in the district meetings of public welfare workers which are held regularly at six different points in the State. The Division holds general staff meetings at the State office four to six times each year as needed. These sessions continue usually for five or six days during which time there is opportunity for individual conferences with State office personnel. The general sessions are rather carefully planned and include discussion of problems of local administra - tion, state policies and procedures, and other matters of interest to the staff. Usually some person outside the agency is invited to speak on subjects of interest to welfare workers. A representative of the Regional Office of the Social Security Board usually attends at least one of the sessions. The general staff meetings offer an opportunity for uniform interpretation of policies and procedures. The mutual interchange of ideas between the field and central office staff in these meetings makes for a better coordinated program. Orientation Center: Early in 1941 an Orientation Center was established by the State Department in the Gage County Assistance Office in Beatrice. New employees were offered a four-weeks period of instruction and some actual working experience under the supervision of a Senior Case Work Supervisor. The Supervisor divided her time between the super - vision of the Orientation Center and case work supervision of the Gage County staff. On April 1, 1942, the Center was transferred'to offices in the Capitol Building in Lincoln to enable the Orientation Supervise* to give full time to the job and to facilitate the participation' of the State office personnel in the orientation program. The trainees now use Lancaster County cases to supplement their training with some experience in handling cases. All new visitors, directors, and other technical staff employed either by a county or by the State office are 98 </seg>
         <seg id="p105">eligible for this special instruction. Others may be admitted when selected by the Admissions Committee from the top three names of those certified on the Merit System register, either from the county or state-wide register. Those already employed are paid their regular sal - aries by the counties; those not employed are paid a stipend of $40.00 by the State to meet the costs of maintenance during the orientation period. The course of study includes selected readings, discussions, study of the State Assistance laws, policies and procedures, and some actual experience in making investigations, writing records, and preparing forms.-. •• : - y~ . . i .'¦¦¦"., :', .:;'¦.' v During the fiscal year ending June 30,1942,26 trainees were enrolled. Surveys among county assistance directors indicate that the Orienta - tion Center is making a worthwhile contribution in giving new workers the fundamentals of the program. Appeals: Federal and State Assistance laws provide for the right of a taxpayer, applicant or recipient to appeal from a decision of the local assistance committee. A written notice of this appears on the notice which informs the applicant or recipient of the local assistance com - mittee's action. Appeal formß are provided upon request by the local or State office for filing appeals. &lt; • '•¦'•' . '. When an appeal for fair hearing has -been filed, the field supervisor in the district is directed to visit the appellant, make whatever investi - gation is needed, and if the appellant still desires it, arrange for a hearing. The law provides that the hearing shall be conducted not earlier than three weeks nor later than six weeks from the date the State Assistance Director orders that a hearing be held. According to present arrangements no field supervisor will conduct a hearing in his own district. Usually the chief of staff assigns to a Aeld supervisor from another district the responsibility for conducting the hearing. In these hearings the parties may choose their witnesses and present any testi - mony they wish. While the procedures are kept on an informal basis, all testimony is given under oath and a verbatim transcript of the entire hearing is transmitted to the State Assistance Office 1 where it is reviewed by the Board of Control. The decision of the Board of Control is final and is sent by registered mail to the appellant. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1941, a total of 49 appeals for fair hearing were filed in connection with the three categorical programs. Of this number 42 were in the OAA program, and of this number 17 were voluntarily withdrawn by the appellants, in 20 the decisions of the local assistance committees were sustained, in 3 they were reversed, and 2 appellants died during the waiting period. Four ADC appeals were filed. Three of these were voluntarily withdrawn before the hearings were held and in the other the county action was sustained. Of the three Blind Assistance appeals filed, one was vol - untarily withdrawn and in the other two the county action was sustained. 99 </seg>
         <seg id="p106">The total number of appeals increased from 36 to 49 over the pre - ceding fiscal year. It is interesting to note that 22 of these were concerned with the responsibility of legally responsible relatives. Most of the withdrawals were secured as a result of the local committee's change of decision after securing additional information. 100 </seg>
         <seg id="p107">DIVISION OF CHILD WELFARE "Government-local, state or federal—is only an institution through which citizens act to fulfill their obligations to themselves, their fam - ilies and their fellow men."* This quotation from an article by Katharine Lenroot, the Chief of the United States Children's Bureau, expresses a philosophy which has £gone into the planning of the work of the Division of Child Welfare during the last few years. Cooperation and joint planning' among county and state welfare departments have continued..•' The material in the fol - lowing pages sets forth the basis for this statement. The Division hopes to see the growth of a broader understanding of the needs of children on the part of the people of Nebraska so that better means for meeting those needs can be attained. The purposes of child welfare and democ - racy will be served if more of our citizens come to realize that "the welfare of the child depends not alone on the care provided for him ( within the family, but also upon the safeguards and services provided ":-by community, State,* and Nation,"^ and that"wherever a child is not getting the care he needs, the war effort is being jeopardized."3 '. 1. RESPONSIBILITIES The Division of Child .Welfare was established by executive order of the Board of Control in May, 1937. The Chief of the Division was made directly responsible to the Director of Assistance and Child Welfare and to the Board of Control for the administration of the child duties as assigned by the 1937 Legislature. As a consequence, "the Division is responsible for the administration, direction, and coor - , dination of all of the Board of Control's child welfare : responsibilities with the exception of the aid to dependent children 'program, which is administered by the Division of Assistance; for the interpretation of child welfare needs and promotion of the development of State and local resources for services to children; for presentation of child welfare problems and the collection of factual material relating to the needs 'of children. ¦• •¦'¦ ;';-V.-; ¦ ;/.¦"-. ¦ ¦¦¦ : \ •¦, ¦¦'//¦; ': : ¦¦•: :¦. ¦'it!.- The functions of the Division include, specifically: ¦'¦':. a.

ORGANIZATION In order to administer the above outlined responsibilities of the Division, the staff is comprised of professionally trained administra - tors and supervisors, all of whom have had experience in the field of child welfare. The Chief of the Division, under the administrative direction of the Director of Assistance and Child Welfare and the Board of Control, is responsible for planning, organizing, and administering the state child welfare activities for the care and protection of children. He is responsible for initiating and promoting the enforcement of laws for the protection of children, and for the establishment of policies and procedures for the administration of such other laws as are delegated to the Division for administration; he acts as state child-placing agent lor the Board of Control; he is responsible for the administrative direction 102 </seg>

The supervisor acts as secretary to the case committees of these institutions and maintains, in a large measure, the flow of work between the individual county welfare agencies and the state : training schools. ; A separate function at present performed by the supervisor of juvenile probation and parole is handling applications for child - ren for admission to and placement and discharge from the Insti - tution for the Feeble Minded. This work is done in cooperation with the superintendent of the institution and the State Board of •.. ¦. -¦ Control. '.-¦' ¦ ¦.:.-/ '¦ ¦.'¦ V ;;' v 7¦¦:"•' ' " : ' ;.'"¦¦'¦ 103 </seg>
         <seg id="p110">Supervisor of County Child Welfare Units The supervisors of county child welfare units have the specific responsibility of developing county child welfare services in the state through joint planning with staff members of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare, the County Child Welfare Boards and their agents, and other county child welfare officials. In addi - tion to the initiation oi the progiam, the supervisors are responsible for the supervision of the activities of all county child welfare service workers, giving general planning and direction to the case work, community organization, and interpretation activities of these workers. The supervisors consult with county officials, county directors, staff members of the State Department, and other persons on community child welfare problems and assist these in - dividuals in plans designed to improve local conditions as they re - late to delinquent, pre-delinquent, neglected, dependent, and handi - capped children. Supervisor of Special Services The supervisor of special services is responsible for evaluation of the activities and services of private child-caring and child-placing agencies; assisting the chief of the Division in the formulation, of standards as a basis for licensing such agencies; providing consul - tation services in assisting child-placing and child-caring agencies in the improvement of the standards of their programs. In addition to this work the supervisor provides, on selected cases, case-work treatment, consultation, and/or supervision for unmarried mothers, planning and arranging for maternity and post partum care, either in the Nebraska Industrial Home or in private maternity homes or lying-in hospitals.

Supervisor of Medical Care Policy The supervisor of medical care policy (part-time position) serves as the consultant on all medical problems relating to the state child welfare program. The supervisor reviews all medical reports relating to maternity homes and lying-in hospitals and to child-caring institutions and agencies and supervises the medical program of the state children's institutions. District Field Supervisors In addition to the administrative staff of the Division outlined above, the field supervisors of the Division of Field Services have definite responsibilities for the general supervision of the local 104 </seg>
         <seg id="p111">administration of the child welfare program. The field supervisors give consultation services to the county child welfare boards and their agents, to the juvenile courts, and to other county officials on child welfare activities; serve as liaison persons between the State Department and the local administrative units; give general interpretation of the rules and regulations of the State Department; and have responsibilities for interpretation and participation in local community programs on child welfare. 3. RECENT CHILD WELFARE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEBRASKA From March, 1936, to October, 1939, administrative responsibilities of the state child welfare agency were administered through a field staff which covered the entire state. During the latter part of this period nine district child welfare consultants, with headquarters through - out the state, were providing the case-work services for the state children's institutions, demonstrating child welfare case work on a selected number of local children's problems, providing consultation to local officials on child welfare cases and strengthening community services, and in general representing the Division. The district con - sultants were providing services to approximately 1,000 dependent de - linquent, and physically or mentally handicapped children each month. In October, 1030, the Board of Control issued an administrative order which outlined briefly a plan for the establishment of a Division of Field Services to supervise the local administration of child welfare, public assistance, and the other related activities of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare. The Board of Control recognized that child welfare, as well as other public welfare services, could best be administered through a local administrative unit equipped to serve its community in all phases of public welfare. This action of the Board of Control was consistent with the intent of the Nebraska Assistance Act passed in 1935 and resulted in the elimination of the district child welfare work performed by the staff of the Division. This reorganization of the field services for the Division was completed on November 1, 1939, and the county child welfare boards were asked to cooperate through their agents, the county directors, in the establishment of services to children through their county offices. The 1937 Assistance Actf made it the duty of the county child welfare hoards to coordinate and cooperate with the county mothers' pension board, county visiting nurse, local municipal, judicial, public and private institutions, charities* hospitals, and organizations for the care, support, education, health, morals, and general welfare of children in the county in both rural and urban areas. The Nebraska Assistance Act defines seven classes of children's cases over which the county child welfare board has jurisdiction (dependent, destitute, abandoned, neglected, de - linquent, physically or mentally handicapped). The law provides that the powers of the county child welfare board shall among other respon - sibilities include the following: . &lt; Compiled Statute* of Nebraska Supplement. 1M1—43-501. 502. 105 </seg>
         <seg id="p112">a.

The county has the following specific duties: a. Making social studies of all children committed to state institutions; 'Complied Statute, of Nebraska Supplement, 1M1—43-504, 505, 506. 106 </seg>

Making available case work service for unmarried mothers who need it or request it Since the reorganization in 1939, the county agencies have assumed their responsibilities in the field of child welfare with an increased interest in, and awareness of, dependent, neglected, delinquent, and men - tally and physically handicapped children. A reporting system which would give as accurate a picture as pos - sible of child welfare activities engaged in by the county departments was developed between October 1939 and July 1940. Monthly statis - tical reports of the work done by county directors and their staffs acting as agents for county child welfare boards are made to the Department' of Assistance and Child Welfare by the county assistance offices. The statistics that follow have been compiled from these reports. FIGURE I—CHILDREN IN CHILD WELFARE OPEN CASE LOAD BY MONTHS—NEBRASKA-JUNE, 1941—JUNE, 1942.

It is thought that this increase in cases does not reflect accurately an actual increase in the number of children needing child welfare services or changes in conditions affecting children through - out the state. Recognition of child welfare problems has continued to grow and consequently an increasing number of child welfare case's has been recorded statistically. Many county staff members have developed measures of skill and self-confidence in dealing with children's problems during the fiscal year, and have begun to report cases to which they believe they are able to give service. As county departments have been under less pressure to meet relief problems, they have had more time to give attention to the recognized child welfare problems. These three factors give evidence that the county departments and county child wel - fare beards have been willing to carry out their responsibilities for child welfare. Table I also shows that in 645, or 54.7 per cent, of the 1179 child welfare cases accepted by the county departments, the family was receiving no public assistance, showing that cases were accepted for. service only.

The field supervisors have continued to give consultation and to help counties secure child welfare service workers where the number, of recognized child welfare problems indi - cated the need for a worker who would devote his entire time to child welfare. A need for more specialized consultation service on child wel - fare problems has been evident throughout the fiscal year. The staff of the Division has been unable to meet this entire need for consulta - tion service because of other responsibilities. Difficult and acute sit - uations have been, handled on an emergency basis as the limited staff permitted. The limited staff is due in part to shortage of available qualified workers. ' . 4. SERVICES TO CHILDREN a. Dependent and Neglected Children ¦ The family unit is the basis of our democratic society, and every child has a right to care and'security in the home of his own par - ents. The first objective of a community social agency program should be to strengthen the child's own home and the community ;/: '¦¦¦¦. services so that the child's interests can best be served by remain- 111 </seg>
         <seg id="p118">ing there. Although limited in facilities, the Division attempts to be of service to county child welfare boards and local organizations - in their efforts to preserve a child's home life. In cases in which the home situation cannot be changed suffi - ciently to meet the child's physical, affectional and social needs, some type of foster care should be made available. Through con - sultation between the local agency and the foster care department, it is considered whether foster care should be provided by an insti - tution or a family home. In selecting families to provide a substitute home for children, certain qualities are sought. There must be intelligence to under - stand the program in general, as foster parents are really exten - sion members of the foster home staff. There must be a genuine liking for children, and interest and skill in providing the services needed by the particular child. Each family is given encourage - ment in thinking through its purpose in taking a child and its possible contribution to the child's training and development before the application is filed. When this has been done, the district foster home worker evaluates the home through interviews with members of the family and their references and recommends ap - proval by the case committee if it is considered that the family qualifies for use as a foster home. During the past year, the foster home -workers made some changes in their methods of home finding, developing a plan of learning more about the family before application was formally filed. This procedure saved time by eliminating obviously ineligible foster parents and enabling the workers to concentrate upon the evaluations of the most usable homes. The figures for the year show that 157 homes were approved for use and that 134 homes were found unqualified for placement of our children. There are five types of foster homes in use. The adoptive home lends itself as a permanent home for the younger children normal in physical and mental development. The free home, which has been used for permanent placements of older children, has not developed as rapidly in recent years due to such factors as depres - sions, drouth, and the fact that some older children are emotionally unable to accept a place in a substitute family group. Our current use of free homes has advanced slightly over the previous year. ( Boarding homes are used for various purposes such as for observation of a child in a family situation before placing him in I an adoptive or free home, treatment of certain behavior problems V which make group living impractical, and for long time care of the child who is not capable of accepting a permanent family place - ment but should have training in a normal family group. The ac - companying Table VI shows that the use of boarding homes was 112 </seg>
         <seg id="p119">developed in the past year to ;tiie extent that 117 children were being boarded on June 80, 1942 in contrast to 77 in the previous June. There was an added use of the boarding home for small children whose abilities can be beßt observed and developed within the family home where individual attention is possible. A new development was also started for the children of early adolescent years who need a period of training in a private boarding home before accepting the responsibility of earning their maintenance through high school. ..,:..•' &#132;:.,'. The school-employment home helps a child to have an exper - ience in a family group and to continue with education while earn - ing his maintenance in return for work after school and on Satur - days. This type of home is frequently used by high' school girls. Last year there was an increase in the number. o£ placements in' school-employment homes. Wage homes are used for the older State wards who are self - supporting but who will remain under supervision until they are 21 years of age. The use of the wage home reaches its peak during the summer when both boys and girls have opportunities io work in private homes during the school vacation. During the past year, there have been three foster home workers to carry on the field activities of this department. The State is divided into three districts, and each worker accepts re - sponsibility for a portion of the work in Lancaster County. Thought has been given to the need for conservation of rubber and gasoline and the reorganization of work in order to continue giving the best service possible with the most economical use of funds. There is an increasing demand for different types of foster care and at the present time prospective foster families are continuing to make application for children. The foster home department is alert to the possibility of development of the program but realizes that it cannot increase its services with the present limited field staff. It is.attempting to fit its specialized services into the general pro - gram in cases where the local community agencies have been unsuc - cessful in preserving 8 child's own home. For that reagon, in - creased use of consultation service between county and state agencies will develop service adapted to the special needs of the individual child. ; . " 113 </seg>

Delinquent Children—Probation and Parole Direct administrative responsibility for planning for place - ment and supervision of boys and girls on parole from the State Industrial School and the Girls' Training School has been delegated by the Board of Control to the county child welfare boards, to be administered by their agents in cooperation with the Division, which acts as liaison agency between the county child •welfare boards and the superintendents of the boys' and girls' training schools. The supervisor of juvenile probation and parole evaluates social studies of children committed to the training schools, which are prepared by the county welfare offices. Progress reports from the training schools are forwarded to the county offices by the supervisor of juvenile probation and parole in order that the county and the family of the child may be kept informed as to his adjustment at the school and be prepared for the time when the child is to return to the community on parole. Upon referral for parole by the training school, the supervisor of juvenile probation and parole cooperates with the county in preparing suitable plans for the child's release. The supervisor works with out-of-state agencies in planning for the parole of non-resident children com - mitted in Nebraska, and with federal probation officers in the cases of federal charges who are assigned to the state training schools. A case committee, comprised of a member of the Board of Control, the superintendent of the training school, and the chief of the Division, passes upon proposed plans for the parole of children from the training schools and is responsible for decisions relating to the final discharge of the child from parole when a satisfactory adjustment has been made. During the period a child is adjusting on parole, the supervisor offers the services of the Division to the county welfare offices which are supervising the children on parole from the training schools. 114 </seg>

Some of the children returned to the training schools were returned for the purpose of making revisions in their parole plans because their placements had not proved satisfactory for their adjustments to the community. As soon as more desirable plans for their release were completed, the children were again placed and many of them were later discharged from parole. Other children returned to the training schools were removed from the community because of parole violations. Some of these children, after an additional period in the school, made progress in later placements. The present program relating to the supervision of children released from the training schools on parole can continue to pro - vide increasingly effective service in guidance to parolees through - out the state. The Division has received excellent cooperation from the county directors and staffs and other county officials. The superintendents of the State Industrial School and the Girls' Training School have worked closely with the Division in developing a more constructive parole program for the rehabilitation of delin - quent children. . c. Unmarried Mothers and Children Born out of Wedlock , The Division is vitally concerned with safeguarding the welfare of unmarried mothers and chfldren horn out of wedlock. The Ne - braska Statutes (1) delegating responsibility to the county diild welfare boards for providing for the child born out of wedlock and for his mother as for any other person in need of financial assist - ance and care, (2) requiring the maternity homes and hospitals in the state to report to the Division every unmarried mother who enters a maternity home, and (3) establishing facilities for caie for unmarried mothers through the Nebraska Industrial.

Activities of the Division which relate to this program may be enumerated as follows: (1) Consultation service to county directors and other officials on all matters relating to the care of the unmarried mother and her child; suggestions as to use of resources within the state for the medical care of the mother; (2) Planning with mothers in the Nebraska Industrial Home for the care of their children. If a mother is able to give proper care to her child through her own resources or those of rel - atives or with the help of local public or private agencies, she is encouraged to do so; (3) In the event the mother wishes to relinquish her child, the Division assists in preparing the necessary forms, arranging court commitment of the child to the State Board of Control, or referring the mother to private child-caring agencies.

There were 344 referrals of unmarried mothers from private hospitals and maternity homes, 66 from the Nebraska Industrial Home, making a total of 410 mothers who were in need of medical and social treatment for themselves and for their children born out of wedlock. An average of 24 referrals per month was received by the Division during the past year which was an increase of an average of 2 per month over the previous fiscal year. d. Children with Physical Handicaps The Division is concerned with children who are handicapped in their social or vocational adjustments because ol a physical disability. The statutes provide that information from school census records regarding blind, deaf, and crippled children be furnished the Division of Child Welfare.6 Inquiry is made of the' county departments concerning children so reported to learn more about them. Often the county department, in cooperation with the Division, can help define the child's handicaps and potentialities co that a plan may be made for him. Each year a number of physically handicapped children are referred to the State Depart - ment of Vocational Rehabilitation for consideration in planning a training program, which is carried out co-operatively by the State Department of Vocational Rehabilitation and the State Division of Child Welfare. c. The Mentally Handicapped Child The Division acts as the liaison agency between the county child welfare boards and their agents and the Institution for' Feeble Minded at Beatrice. The case situations of all children who • are committed to the Institution for Feeble Minded are reviewed by the Division and admittance of the child to the institution is subject to approval by a case committee, composed of a member of the Board of Control, the institution superintendent, and the chief ; of the Division. This procedure prevents the admission of a child whose mental condition has been improperly or inadequately diag - nosed and those whose needs for supervision and care can best, be met in their own home or some other family group in the community. The diagnostic and consultation services of the Uni - versity of Nebraska are resources which are used by the Division in the study and planning for treatment of children who are com - mitted to the Institution for Feeble Minded. f. County &lt;3hUd Welfare Service Program ¦ &lt;- Under the provision made by the Social Security Act, Title V, Part 3, federal funds for child welfare services became available •Compiled SUtuU. of N.brMka, 1929: 79-1916. 117 </seg>
         <seg id="p124">to the states in 1936. These funds have enabled the state public welfare agencies to establish, extend, and strengthen— especially in rural areas—child -welfare services for the protection and care of homeless, dependent, neglected, delinquent and handicapped chil - dren. The Social Security Act specifies two major activities for which allotments of federal money may be expended; (1) for pay - ing part of the cost of local services in areas predominately rural, and (2) for developing state services for the encouragement and assistance of adequate methods of community child welfare organ - ization throughout the state. Nebraska begari participating in the program in 1936 and has used the funds within the above areas for stimulating and coordinating developments of needed services for children within the existing programs of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare and the county welfare agencies. Each year from 1936 through the fiscal year 1941-1942 an increasing number of counties has requested that the services of especially trained child welfare workers be made available for children in their communities. Difficulties in obtaining suitable personnel, due to the war and war-related activities, prevented com - pletion of plans to place child welfare workers in some additional counties during this past year, and prevented the replacement of other workers. On July 1, 1941, ten counties—Brown, Cass, Gage, Lincoln, Madison, Morrill, Otoe, Pawnee, Flatte and Seward—had child welfare units. With the exception of the 3rown County unit, which was discontinued August 25, 1941, these counties continued to make use of child welfare services through the 1941-1942 fiscal year. In September, 1941, a unit was set up to include Johnson and Nemaha counties, one worker dividing her time between the counties. After an interval of seven months, each county em - ployed a full-time worker. The Division has assisted the two heavily populated counties, Douglas and Lancaster, in giving more adequate services to chil - dren within their boundaries. Some of the Division's funds have been budgeted to permit Douglas and Lancaster counties to have additional child welfare service because the caseloads of delinquent boys and girls from the state training schools, unmarried mothers, and other child welfare problems have been too large for the staffs of the county to handle -without assistance. At the end of the fiscal year, three child welfare service workers were employed in Douglas county, and Lancaster county had one child welfare service worker and two other case workers with responsibility for child welfare cases. On June 30, 1942, a total of thirteen counties had child -welfare -workers. Plans for the placement of workers in additional counties are contingent upon the availability of qualified workers. During the year the county child welfare service unite received requests on behalf of 1237 children in 840 families. The sources of these requests are shown in Table _IX. 118 </seg>

         <seg id="p126">In addition to using these funds for the development of child welfare programs within the counties, the Division has paid a por - tion of the salary and travel expense of the field supervisors of the Division of Field Services, the staff which is responsible for con - sultation on children's cases, general child welfare planning and coordination of existing services for the welfare of children in the several counties in their districts. g. Licensing Activities The Division is responsible for supervising and licensing the child-caring and child-placing institutions and agencies in the state. Table XI lists the private child-caring and child-placing agencies and shows the number of children under their care as of June, 1942. The supervisor of special services of the Division handles the activities of the Division in this field on a part-time basis. The need for supervision, consultation, and more adequate planning would require the services of a full-time person. During the past year visits have been made to most of the institutions and the physical conditions have been improved. Nine child-placing agencies and eight child-caring agencies were licensed by the Division for the year 1942. One agency was given a provisional child-placing license. Several agencies were not licensed as they did not meet standards set by the Division. TABLE XI—CHILDREN UNDER CARE OR SUPERVISION OF PRIVATE CHILD-CARING AGENCIES AND INSTI - TUTIONS, JUNE, 1942.

         <seg id="p127">Responsibility for the inspection and licensing of maternity . homes and lying-in hospitals -was assigned by the Board of Control to the Division in May, 1937. In January, 1942, the responsibility for the inspection and licensing was assigned to the Department of Health by an opinion of the Attorney General. Through the De - partment of Health a cooperative plan for inspection and licensing of maternity homes and lying-in hospitals was agreed upon between the Division of Child Welfare and the Department of Health. The two departments require the inspection of maternity homes and lying-in hospitals by a local physician and the approval of the application for license toy the local board of health. The supervisor of the Division of Maternal and Child Health of the Department of Health reviews all reports and applications from the maternity homes and lying-in hospitals. These applications are then approved by the Division of Child Welfare before the licenses are granted. During the fiscal year 1941-1942 there were 157 hospitals licensed. There are 22 counties which do not have a licensed mater - nity home or hospital. h. Psychological Services ¦ The statutes of Nebraska require that state and county organ - izations shall provide expert mental examinations, and that the Board of Control shall provide expert psychological services for inmates of state institutions when need ia indicated. Children in state institutions may be examined by the psychologist in the employ of the State Board of Control. Through arrangements with the University of Nebraska, additional psychometric services are available to the Division and to the county offices. This resource has been widely used during the past year, and a number of children have been brought to Lincoln for psychometric study, case work planning, and treatment. The psychologists of the University of Nebraska have made field trips to several counties and have conducted examinations for children at the request of the county agency and/or .local schools. In all instances where such field clinics have been hold, the local school officials have participated in the referral of chil - dren for examination, in sharing part of the costs of the clinic, and in providing facilities for the examinations. Table XII shows the number of psychological examinations given to children during the past fiscal year. Examinations were given to 397 individuals. 121 </seg>

Training Program In view of the continuing number of requests coming from counties for trained child welfare workers and increasing difficulties in securine personnel, the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare has continued its program for training individuals for this field. During the fiscal year, six persons were enrolled in the Grad - uate School of Social Work at the University of Nebraska as full time Btudents for one year, and two persons were enrolled for a semester each. The additional schooling enabled these eight per - sons to qualify for the position of Child Welfare Worker I and equivalent classifications under the Nebraska Merit System. A stipend of not to exceed $75.00 per month was made possible for the continuance of their education. Granting of the stipend was con - tingent upon the individual's willingness to accept upon completion of the training program reasonable opportunities for employment as might be offered in the state public welfare program for at least one year. j. The Index The Nebraska Index grew from the master file in 1936 serving only the Child Welfare Bureau to a state-wide Index in, 1939 serving as a state central exchange on children's cases for all public child - caring institutions and all licensed private child-caring institutions and agencies in the state. In 1939 the National Committee on Social Service Exchanges recognized the Nebraska Index as a standard social service exchange. •• . Since 1939, the size of the Index has increased considerably, because additional agencies are clearing and the agencies that nreviously had been using the Index have increased the number of their clearances and registrations. The private child-caring 122 </seg>
         <seg id="p129">agencies privileged to use the Index include: Catholic Child Wel - fare, Chad Saving Institute, Child Welfare Association, Christian Children's Home, Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, Federation for Jewish Service, Immanuel Children's Home, Lutheran Children's Home Society, Masonic Home for Children, Mothers' Jewels Home, Nebraska Children's Home Society, Social Welfare Society, St. Thomas Orphanage, and Tabitha Home. Table XIII shows the volume of inquiries, registrations, and notifications handled by the Index to June 30, 1942. On that date, the total recordings of the Index were approximately 27,231. Since the Index is now serving the entire state in the specialized area of child welfare and foster homes, it will be increasingly useful to '.'-. member agencies. The Nebraslca Index cooperates with the private social service exchanges in Omaha and Lincoln to avoid duplication of work.

         <seg id="p130">5. SERVICE TO STATE CHILDREN'S INSTITUTIONS The Division, by administrative direction of the Board of Control, has responsibility for the supervision of the social services for the state children's institutions. This involves joint planning with the superintendents of the state children's institutions for all children com - mitted to their care. This action was taken in an effort to carry out the intent of the legislature when it abolished the former Child "Welfare Bureau in 1937 and assigned its work to the Board of Control to pro - mote a better integration of the state's services for children. . The children's institutions with which the Division is working are as follows: Correctional: State Industrial School, Kearney Girls' Training School, Geneva Dependent: State Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln Physically Handicapped: Orthopedic Hospital,l Lincoln Educational: School for the Deaf, Omaha School for the Blind, Nebraska City Mentally Defective: Institution for Feeble Minded, 2 Beatrice Maternity Care: Nebraska Industrial Home, 3 Milford Before a child is admitted to any institution, other than the cor - rectional schools, a complete social study is made by the county of the child's residence, and admittance of the child to the institution is granted on the basis of the findings. In this manner the children most In need of -the services offered by the particular institution may, on a selective basis, receive these services. As a result of this intake policy other plans are frequently made, in cooperation with county officials, for children who will benefit from care in their own community. For all children admitted to institutions the social study is used as a basis tor planning for that child within the institution. The facil - ities of the Division are used in planning for the child after he is admitted, and his release from the institution is worked out through joint planning with the superintendent of the institution, the Division, and the local agency in the county to which the child is being returned. The present organization for institutional social services places the major responsibility for child welfare work within the institution on the personnel of that institution, and outside of the institution on the local welfare agencies. The division is primarily concerned with the development of adequate standards of care, an effective procedure for relating the state and local services toward the rehabilitation of children, and the establishment of satisfactory working relationships among all persons interested in a child who has need for the educational, vocational, and social training which the state children's institutions provide. T^h? premium of thU Inrtltution has been integrated with Services for Crip- VThe CDlvl?lon works only with persons .under 21 years of age. "The DlvUion work, with both the mother and child. </seg>
         <seg id="p131">DIVISION OF SERVICES FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN Daring the past year, continued progress has been made in improv - ing services to handicapped children in Nebraska. For the first time since the program started in 1936, there has been a decrease in the num - ber of new applications. The present number of active cases is also lower than in the.previous report. This probably does not represent an actual decrease in existence of crippling conditions but several known factors contribute. During the'year, ninety-one (91) children moved from the state compared to fifty-one (51) the previous year. Sixty - eight (68) cases were closed because of financial ineligibility, reflecting the trend toward increased employment and earnings. These cues wen closed only after careful consideration and consultation with the phys - ician regarding extent of further medical care and the ability oi the family to provide on a private basis. .The number refusing care (86) may seem high compared to thirteen (13) the previous year. An effort was made to review these cases carefully and to contact each family either personally or by letter to determine the basis for apparent lack of interest in further treatment. .Each case was closed only after exhaust - ing every available resource for gaining their cooperation to proceed with treatment. In many of these cases, extensive surgery had failed to accomplish the desired improvement and parents became discouraged and expressed a desire to discontinue treatment. In other instances, the crippling condition was a minor one in which the patient and parents could not, even after careful interpretation, accept the need for further care. Considering these factors, it seems that the present number of active cases (1184) represents a more accurate picture of the number of children:under care. . ¦ The increased mobility of the population has had its repercussion in Services for Crippled Children. Children removing to other states have been referred to State Services immediately so that they might be made aware of resources for treatment near their new homes. Like - wise, it has been possible to accept children from other states who arc now living in Nebraska and to extend to them the facilities for ortho - pedic care here. Up to now about six (6) handicapped children have left the state to one (1) moving into Nebraska. As has been anticipated for some time, there has been a slight de - crease in the number of hospital admissions during the year and at present there is no waiting list. The register has been increased by forty-seven (47) in spite of the decrease in the number of new patients. This has been due partially to the new plan for reporting congenital deformities on birth certificates. These are transmitted to the Public Health Nursing Supervisor, who visits the family physician and deter - mines whether or not the child is under care for the crippling condition. 125 </seg>

         <seg id="p133">School census is also used to locate crippled children. There is some in- V dication that counties have failed to report known cases for the register, except those for whom Services for Crippled Children applications were completed. . During the year, one thousand seven hundred seventy-nine (1779) children were examined at Extension Clinics, an increase of four hun - dred ninety-eight (498) over the previous year. Many of the new pa - tients were seen for the first time at these clinics, and plans initiated 1 for applications and hospital admissions. Children found to be in need I of hospital care which could not be furnished through Services for Crip- ' pled Children, were referred to proper agencies for further plans. As in former years, the Elks Lodge has been of great service in providing volunteers to assist with the clinics and arranging free lunches for I patients and their families. In many cases, they have also assisted with transportation and have financed special needs not otherwise available. \ With increasing transportation problems, the Extension Clinics become more indispensable in providing follow-up care. The depletion of ined- ! kal men in rural areas increases the need for diagnostic service which \ the clinics offer. ' \ Relationships with cooperating agencies have been clarified and strengthened. The services of the Elks Lodge have been mentioned pre - viously. •'.: . • . : #The Nebraska Crippled Children's Society has expressed renewed interest in participating in arranging care for crippled children in Ne - braska. They have been especially helpful in assisting with arranging \ for special educational plans for patients not physically able to attend regular school. They have furnished an ample supply of "Nebraska Law Relating to Education of Handicapped Children" and have in several instances furnished transportation for patients to clinics and Orthopedic \ Hospital. They have now offered to supply a lending library for parents ! of handicapped children. -. ¦'¦ ¦ - --.••&lt;• -•¦ ¦•¦¦;". ¦¦¦¦;¦¦•¦¦¦¦ '¦¦.'' .",::'..'.; ¦;¦¦.'.- . i County chapters of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis \ have assisted by providing medical services for several adult patients I who could not be accepted for Services for Crippled Children because of j age. They have assisted financially with vocational plans for several \ patients and with swimming tanks and special needs of others. State Vocational Rehabilitation Division has expressed interest in co- ( operating more closely with Services for Crippled Children. In May, 1942, an agreement was reached, whereby a representative of Vocational i Rehabilitation would be present at each of tiie Services for Crippled Children Extension Clinics to interview prospective applicants for their services. Services for Crippled Children patients are referred routinely to Vocational Rehabilitation at the age of sixteen (16). It was thought that the new plan might expedite completion of plans and insure a more complete review of all potential candidates for rehabilitation services. -Reporting to counties has been improved to some extent but more 127 </seg>
         <seg id="p134">complete reporting is desired. A monthly letter is now sent to each county, reporting on the progress of each hospital patient, on treatment plans for each new patient accepted during the month, and all reopened and closed cases. Each county has been notified of the list of active cases according to state office files and the names of all children on the state register. County assistance directors were requested to submit re - views regularly to keep the state office informed of the social situation and attitude of the family toward the crippled child and the treatment he is receiving. OHTHODONTIA SERVICES In January, 1942, the Children's Bjureau accepted our plan to fur - nish orthodontia care to children who had been treated through Services for Crippled Children for cleft palate and harelip repairs. This work is under the supervision of a pedodontist, of the University of Nebraska, Dental College, and an orthodontist, lip to this time, only a small num - ber of patients have availed themselves of this service. It is expected that about twenty-five (25) patients will be cared for during the com - ing year. MEDICAL SOCIAL SERVICE The Medical Social Service Department now consists of the Medical Social Work Supervisor and one Medical Social Worker. Direct service is given to patients and their parents: at Orthopedic Hospital and the Extension Clinics. Since January, 1942, when figures were first com - piled, to July, 1942, the Social Service Department has received two thousand three hundred thirty-three (2333) pieces of mail and three thousand four hundred forty-two (3442) letters and telegrams have been sent out. The Medical Social Workers have had one thousand five hundred forty-fivo (1545) interviews with patients, parents, and repre - sentatives of interested agencies. It is&gt; hoped that during the coining year, the Medical Social Work Supervisor will be able to devote more time to consultation service to County Assistance Directors, Child Wel - fare workers, and other agencies concerned with care and education of handicapped children.

         <seg id="p140">COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION Fiscal Year July 1, 1941 to June 30, 1942 Dunne the fiscal year of July 1. 1941 to June 30, 1942, ninety-one Nebraska counties participated in the Commodity Distribution program. Operations consisted principally of the School Lunch Program, clothing distribution, and tho servicing of thirteen State Instituions eligible to participate in this activity on a limited basis. Minor activities of the Division included the servicing of W.P.A. Household Aide Projects, H.YA. Training Centers, Recreation and Health Camps, Nursery Schoolß and a Summer School Lunch Program. Thirty-two food items were distributed during the year, many of which were particularly adapted for use in the School Lunch Piogram and were supplied by the Agricultural Marketing Administration for that purpose only. Development of the School Lunch Program proceeded as in the past, with the State adhering to its established policy of expansion from the merits of the program rather than through promotional activity. The results of this procedure become more encouraging each year, and during the past fiscal period, the School Lunch Program in Nebraska nearly doubled over the previous year. Clothing activities underwent a major change during the year, The Work Projects Administration found it necessary to withdraw most of their county Sewing Centers, and production was maintained in a few large specialized units. This change made it advisable for the Com - modity Division to establish a State Clothing Warehouse, from which consolidated shipments could be made to the various, counties on order. Shipments from this warehouse commenced in January, and a regular routine procedure was well established within a short time. Increased employment and conditions usually existent during war years will no doubt have the effect of reducing the clothing distribution this coming year. On the other hand, it seems quite certain that the School Lunch Program will show a further expansion. A very marked increase in public interest and support has been evident each year that this program has been in operation. As the public becomes better informed about this activity, particularly through actual experience Wl» the program itself, the demand for this service continues to grow. As there has been no indication to date that the limit of expansion has even been approached, we believe that the School Lunch Program m Nebraska will continue to expand this coming school year, provided A. M. A. Mods are available. 134 </seg>

         <seg id="p144">VIII. SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS County Farms, W.P.A. Household Aide, W.P.A. and N.Y.A. Demonstration and Training Centers, Lancaster County Flood Relief, and general clients during the closing days of tne^Direct Distribution Program in July and August received food com - modities having an estimated valuation of $41,973.89. . , . ; IX. SCHOOL LUNCH AND NURSERY SCHOOL PROGRAMS The School Lunch and Nursery School Program expanded mater - ially during this fiscal period. A total of 4,151,219 pounoVof foodstuffs having an estimated valuation of ?350,225.61 was dis - tributed to these programs. Approximately 2,700 schools and 04,500 children were served during March, the peak month of the program. 2,832 schools were certified as eligible to participate in the program during the past school year, and these applications covered 65,016 children. 220 of these schools covering 21,269 children applied for complete lunches under W.P.A. supervision; sql schools with 7,370 children had complete lunches under spon - sor supervision; 2,031 schools with 36,377 children were certified for participation on a partial lunch basis This showed _a very considerable shift both in schools and children certified to the full lunch program, and it is anticipated that this trend will continue during the next school term. Quite a few schools which originally planned to serve only fruits and fruit juices, changed their pro - grama during the term so as to include other items needing little cooking, such as evaporated milk, canned pork and beans, peanut butter, honey, etc. X. STATE CLOTHING WAREHOUSE The Work Projects Administration revised its plan of clothing production during this fiscal period from sewing centers «i ap - proximately sixty counties serving only those counties, to fifteen units of specialized production, located at Albion, Alma, Beatrice, Broken Bow, Fremont, Fairbury, Grand Island, Hastings, Lin - coln, Norfolk, Omaha, O'Neill, South Sioux City,, Trenton, and Wahoo. Items produced at these units are shipped to a state clothing warehouse located at Lincoln, and maintained by the Division of Commodity Distribution, from which orders to all counties are filled. Due to curtailments within the W.P.A., the number of fabrication units has been greatly reduced and con - centrated in the eastern section of the state, but it is felt that production, plus present warehouse stocks, will be sufficient to meet demands. , XI. GROSS ACTUAL MERCHANDISE LOSS FROM ALL CAUSES Actual losses due to natural shrinkage and spoilage incurred during this fiscal period amounted to 23,988 pounds of foodstuffs, having an estimated valuation of $1,641.74. This amounts to 4/10 of \% of the total pounds of foods distributed. XII. SALVAGED CONTAINERS SOLD $542.90 was realized from the sale of salvaged containers during thia fiscal period, and remitted to the Department of State As - sistance and Child Welfare, Commodity Salvage Fund. 138 </seg>
