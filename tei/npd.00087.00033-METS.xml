         <seg id="p004">The Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks IV. Meat Meal and Fish Meal Compared with Meat Meal, Fish Meal, 1 - and Soybean Meal as Protein Concentrates C. W. ACKERSON, M. J. BUSH, AND &gt;. E. MUSSEHL The past few years have seen a great increase in the production of soy - beans in this country. The reason for this is found largely in the increased use of soybeans in animal feeding as well as in the manufacture of edible products such as oleomargarine and lard substitutes and in the expanding requirements of industry for basic materials, notably in the manufacture of paints, enamels, and plastics. The soybean has been a staple in the human diet in the Orient for centuries. Its use as an animal food has been studied at many of the experiment stations by means of feeding trials with domestic animals as well as laboratory animals. Its use in rat work is widespread. Philips and Hauge (1), Tomhave and Mumford (2), and Miller and Bearse (3) studied the value of soybean meal as a protein supplement for laying hens. Kennard, Holder, and White (4) found a mixture of soy - bean meal and corn meal only slightly inferior to corn meal and butter - milk for fattening cockerels.The value of soybean meal in the ration of growing chicks was investigated by Philips, Carr, and Kennard (5), Tom - have and Mumford (6), and Carver, St. John, Miller, and Bearse (7). In general it is believed that soybean meal can replace a portion of the animal protein in a growing ration. The effect of heat in the preparation of soy - bean meal was studied by Wilgus, Norris, and Heuser (8), who found raw meals inferior in protein efficiency to the well-cooked meals. In work at this station (9) it has been shown that a protein concen - trate derived from animal sources is better than one mixed from vegetable sources and (10) that a mixture of animal proteins promotes slightly better growth than a single animal protein concentrate in the ration of growing chicks. In view of the absence of specific work on the effect of supplant - ing a portion of the meat and fish meals with soybean meal, an experiment was planned wherein the variable consisted of introducing soybean meal into the concentrate. : PREPARATION OF THE RATIONS In the preparation of the rations used in.this experiment the base was the same as that used in earlier work in this series (9). In this test the experimental variable planned was that of the protein concentrate. In one instance a mixture of meat meal and fish meal was used, and in the other a mixture of meat meal, fish meal, and soybean meal was fed. This work extends the findings with regard to animal and vegetable protein con - centrates for growing chicks, and also permits conclusions to be drawn </seg>

The soybean meal used was produced by the expeller process. The rations were mixed as in previous work; that is, a quantity of the base was mixed and divided into two portions. To 85 pounds of one por - tion was added a mixture of five pounds each of meat meal, fish meal, and soybean meal, and designated as ration 3MFSX. In order to have a second concentrate with the same protein content, one Was made up of a mixture of 6.42 pounds each of meat meal and fish meal, together with 1.93 pounds of starch.

Thirty chicks were selected which weighed between 35 and 39 grams, and these were divided into two lots of 15 each. The average initial weight was 17 grams in each lot.

         <seg id="p006">Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks 5 the technique of handling and feeding these chicks from that described in recent papers of this series (9, 10). Feeding equal amounts to all chicks daily was continued, so that the matter of a variable intake did not enter into the experimental error. Cod-liver oil was fed individually by bur - ette at a level of 0.6 per cent of the ration. The chicks were weighed in - dividually at intervals which coincided most closely with the consumption of 150 grams of air-dry feed by each chick. From these weights the rates of gain on successive increments of dry matter and the rates of gain at period weights were calculated. The results of such calculations are given in Table 2. .

', . ' ¦ . At the end of the feeding period the chicks were killed by ether anes - thesia after feed had been withheld for 16 hours. After chilling sufficiently to prevent loss of blood the intestinal tract was emptied of its contents. Nitrogen was determined on the contents of the proventriculus and giz - zard; thus the nitrogen found could be subtracted from the abount fed since it represents unused nitrogen in the body at death. This correction involves but 0.1 per cent of the.nitrogen fed and could be ignored with - out noticeable effect on the accuracy of the final results. The sex and net weight of each chick were noted at this time. From the net weights of the chicks in the two lots the mean net weights were calculated, together with their standard errors. These data are given in Table 3, and show that no marked difference existed between lots.

The five per cent point of 'F' on the basis o£ Table 4 is 2.98; thus there was no significant difference apparent in the primary analysis of the net body weights. The standard deviation was 15.23, SO that with a mean net weight of 398 grams the coefficient of variation is 3.8 per cent. In this experiment the chance distribution of males and females led to unequal numbers of the sexes in both lots, which increased the standard deviation and consequently the coefficient of variation.

         <seg id="p008">Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks conclusions 1. The rate of gain (gain in weight divided by the weight of dry matter fed) was not materially altered by substituting soybean meal for one-third of the meat meal and fish meal of the protein cqncentratc of the ration of growing chicks. The gain of newly hatched chicks fed for six weeks amounted to 44 per cent of the dry matter fed. 2. The mean net weight of the chicks fed the mixture of meat jmeal; fish meal, and soybean meal was not significantly different from that of the lot fed a mixture of meat meal,and fish meal as the protein concentrate of the ration. '¦.''¦¦'¦'¦' 3. In each of the two lots about 41 per cent of the nitrogen fed was retained in the gain. ; 4. Slightly less ot the calcium was retained by the 2-MFX lot, but this lot retained slightly more of the phosphorus fed. The lower retention of calcium could be attributed to the slightly higher content of calcium in the feed. However, differences were as great within lots as between lots, so the differences were not significant. . !' ' 5. With the base used, a mixture of meat meal, fish meal, and soybean meal can satisfactorily replace a mixture of meat meal and fish meal as the protein concentrate. -,-: ; {¦ LITERATURE CITED ' 1.
