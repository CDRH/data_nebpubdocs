Members of thk State Banking B&lt; Siii.s: In compliance with the provisions of the Hank ng Act, I have the honor to submit herewith the thirteenth nnual report of the Secretary of the State Ranking Hoard for he year 1904. showing the condition of the banks under your upervision on November 10, Uhi4. 515 in number: also sum mries of the resou rces and liabilities of such banks compiled rom reports submitted to the State Banking Board in response Us made by the Department daring the year: together with uch information regarding failures, receiverships, supreme ourt decisions affecting banks, recommendations, •ontemplated by the provisions of the law. This report covers the period beginning N r 18 1908, and ending November 10, 1!«&gt;4. The year 1904 was one of unexampled prosperity tor the banks of Nebraska, and their reports and the summaries th&gt; herewith given reflect credit to the State and its financial insti - tutions. While the banks under your supervision hn pered and enjoyed a growth of business phenomenal, said with truth, borne out by the statistical portion of this re - port, that conservatism and safety characterize the ma: ment to a nattering degree. This evidenced by the fact that Nebraska stands the lowest of any State in the Union, so t we have information, in the number of failures, there having been no bank failures in the State during the perkxi by this report, in fact Nebraska baa had butonebanl Lincoln, January l'h. 1903 </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 THIKTEKNTH ANNUAL REPOKT OF THE since January 21, 1908, that being the Elkhorn Valley Hank of ( &gt;'Neill, Nebraska, which suspended November L'4, last. When taken possession of by State Hank Examiner Whittemore it was found that all the bank's casli and a large amount of its bills receivable were missing, and that its President and Cashier had absconded. This bank was examined by Examiner Whittemore on December 10, 1908, at which time the condition of the bank, as shown by his report, did not hazard the interests of depositors. Events proved that subsequent to the examination above refer - red to the management of the bank dissipated its assets to a large extent and ended the work of wrecking the bank by flight. sequestering or taking with them its funds and a i&gt;ortion of its securities, destroying the note register so that their irregularities might not be specifically detected. The bank at the time of this examination held the notes of President Bernard McGreevy for $8,000.00 (not yet due) and secured by a collateral note amounting to over $8,000. 00 secured by real estate, that, in the opinion of the Examiner, made the loan safe. This collateral note was found among the assets of the bank after it closed. Irregularities found showed conclusively that a studied and systematic effort had been made to realize on the assets regardless of future effect on the integrity of the bank. This failure emphasizes the necessity for more fre - quent examinations, which, while not effective in making men honest, would cut short such operations as characterized the wrecking of this bank. Under the proper headings and in detail I beg to sub mit the following report: During the year: One bank reorganized and re-incorporated. Seven have changed from private to incorporated banks Ten have nationalized. Three have sold to and been succeeded by other banks. Eight have gone into voluntary liquidation, paid dejxisitors in full and quit business. </seg>

Prior to the year 1!»&lt;&gt;1 there was no law requiring Receivers of banks to report to the State Banking Board, hence there is no data at hand from which statistical information pertaining to banks in the hands of receivers prior to that year can be tained.

ColeV.

Providing such au ment is sufficiently definite in its terms, and is clearly estab lished. and the situation of the parties and of the property is such that justice and equity call for such remedy. Dissenting opinion by Holcomb, J. on page 25!». These two opinions are perfectly consistent so far as prin - ciples of law and equity go.
