            <seg id="p116">OPINIONS. our opinion contemplates the giving of but one bond by a depository hank. Under section 3c of said chapter the treasurer is authorized to keep on deposit, in a depository bank, not to exceed 50 per cent, of the principal sum ex - pressed in such bond. Had two bonds been contemplated by the legislature, it would be reasonable to expect that some statutory provision might be found, declaring how the liability would be apportioned where two bonds with differ - ent sureties were given in the event of the subsequent in - solvency or failure of such depository bank. No such pro - vision is to be found in our statutes as it exists at this time. In case a bank should give two depository bonds with differ - ent sureties, one bond for $10,000 and another for $5,000 and the treasurer would deposit generally without specifying under which particular bond the deposits were made, it is apparent that no little difficulty might exist, in the event it became necessary to enforce payment from the sureties, in fixing the liability of the sureties. I am. therefore, of the opinion that only one depository bond for each bank should be recognized by you and that you should deposit not to exceed 50 per cent, of the amount of such bond.
