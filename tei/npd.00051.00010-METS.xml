            <seg id="p038">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION- 111 PART III Opinions and Findings ORDERS ON FORMAL COMPLAINTS. FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 360 Lew:-j H. Blackledge et al, Complainants, vs. Farmers Independent Telephone Company of Red Cloud and Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, Defendants. OPINION AND FINDING Cook, Commissioner: This proceeding is based upon two motions, one filed by the Farmers Independent Telephone company of Red Cloud, Nebraska, and the other filed by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, both looking to an order from this Commission in conformity with the decision of the supreme court rendered in the above entitled cause on appeal. To secure an understanding of the present proceeding it will be neces - sary briefly to refer to the course the litigation has already taken. For that purpose we repeat a portion of the findings of the Commission heretofore made. Telephone service was first established at Red Cloud in 1899. ThÂ« plant was built by the Nebraska Telephone company, hereafter referred to as the Nebraska company, and was confined to the city, connected, liowever, with the toll line system of that company. Subsequently, and because of the refusal of the Nebraska company to build lines into the surrounding territory, farmers living in the vicinity of Red Cloud built a system of their own with an exchange located outside of the city. In 1904 a number of the business men of Red Cloud cooperated with the farmers in establishing an exchange in the city for the purpose of giving switching service- to the farmers' system and for local service in the city. The company was incorporated under the name of the Farmers Independent Telephone company, hereinafter referred to aa the Farmers company. Its stockholders were allowed to furnish their own lines and instruments and receive service on a switching basis ftt a discount from the regular rates. In 1910 the Lincoln Telephone * </seg>
            <seg id="p039">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 112 Telegraph company, hereinafter referred to as the Lincoln company, ex - tended its southern Nebraska toll line system into Red Cloud and connected it with the Farmers company's exchange under a written con - tract for an indefinite time. In 1912 the Lincoln company purchased the Red Cloud exchange of the Nebraska company along wish a number of other exchanges and all oi its toll line system located in southern Ne - braska. As this gave the Lincoln company two toll lines into Red Cloud. one connected with the Farmers company exchange and the other with the exchange bought by it from the Nebraska company, the Lincoln company naturally sought to discontinue one of these lines. It decided to discontinue the one connected with the Farmers exchange. It offered to connect the two exchanges at Red Cloud with a trunk line in order to give the Farmers company long distance service, but this was not ac - ceptable to the farmers company. Recourse was then had to the Com - mission for permission to make the proposed substitution, which permis - fion was granted. Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Farmers Independent Tele phone Co., 11th N. S. R. C. Rep. 161 This left both of the companies with an exchange in Hed Cloud con - pected with each other by a trunk line to be used for long distance pur - poses only. The condition outlined above obtained until the year 1917. In the latter part of that year the Lincoln company decided to change its plant to a common battery metallic type and entered upon an active cam - paign for iidditional business. Its rates at that time were somewhat higher than the Farmers company's rates but the service furnished by it was much better than that offered by the Farmers company. There was a general desire in the community to eliminate the expense of duplicate plants. (Because of the local ownership of the Farmers company public sentiment settled on that company's plant as the one that ought to sur - vive. The business men, who were the chief sufferers from having the two systems, organized and offered to patronize the Farmers company exclusively if it would install a common battery system, which it agreed to do. There was sharp rivalry between the two companies and during the latter part of the year 1917 - 81 of the subscribers of the Lincoln company discontinued its service, thus reducing its subscribers from 294 in the fall of 1917 to 213 on December 31, 1917. The Lincoln com - pany, seeing that it was rapidly losing subscribers, severed the trunk line connection between the two exchanges, thus depriving the Farmer company's subscribers of long distance service through their own instru - ments. The Farmers company thereupon asked the 'Commission for an order restoring this conection, which was granted on the showing that the action of the Lincoln company was without the authority of the Commission. fc k Two petitions in intervention were filed In that proceeding by sub- scribers to the service of both companies. The petitions alleged that </seg>
            <seg id="p040">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 113 the operation and maintenance of two telephone systems separate from each other as to local service was unreasonable and unjust to the public, both as to service and rates. One of the petitioners prayed that an interchange of service be provided between the subscribers of both com - panies upon such terms as the Commission might find just and reason - able; the other prayed for a physical consolidation of the two systems under one ownership or management. The petitions in intervention were treated as original complaints and separated from the truck line proceeding. The Farmers company answered the petitions by denying the jurisdiction of the Commission to grant any of the relief sought for beyond the interchange of lorn; iistance messages which it was already giving and desired to continue jiving: it alleged that to require more than a trunk line connection for long distance service would destroy its business and would take its prop - erty without compensation. The Lincoln company filed an answer and i-ross-petkion, likewise denying the authority of the Commission to i;rant the relief prayed for by either of the cross-petttioners. In addition it alleged that ir bad already suffered a considerable loss in its local exchange business by reason of the connection between the two ex - changes and that if required to maintain the connection in the future it would suffer the loss of practically all of its local business and thereby i he value of its property would be practically destroyed. The prayer o[ the Lincoln company was for permission to discontinue the connection between the two exchanges. The Farmers company replied to the Lin - coln company's cross-petition alleging an estoppel of the Lincoln com - pany by reason of the Commission's order restoring the connection and alleging further that the maintenance of the connection was protected by the written contract between the eoirrpanies as mentioned above. After lull hearing the Commission entered its order May 1, 1919. The order denied the application of the Lincoln company for permission to discontinue the trunk line connection between its exchange and the exchange of the Farmers company and to discontinue furnishing long dis - tance service to subscribers of the Farmers company. The order also provided as follows: "(2) That zone telephone service be substituted for the present separate exchange service of the companies affected, the zone to con - sist of all of the subscribers to the local service of both companies; and the companies are hereby ordered to install and maintain as many additional metallic circuit lines connecting the exchange3 of said companies in Red Cloud, Nebraska, as may be required to furnish good and adequate service, and to furnish to all of the subscribers connected with said exchanges telephone service with each other at the following rates of charge In addition to the present monthly rates as follows: Business subscribers, $.75 per month, residence subscribers $.20 per month, farm and switching subscribers $.10 per month; and that additional switchboard operators be employed suffi - cient to give adequate service. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">114 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT "(3) That the relation as to numbers of business and uiban subscribers to the service of each of said companies on October 1, 1917, be maintained, and each of said companies is hereby pro - hibited from accepting subscribers to the local service, excepting farm and switching subscribers, in greater proportion as to the revenues due therefrom as near as may be. as to each other than the proportion existing on October 1. 1917." The order was to become effective, under its terms, on June 1, 191!* except as to the third paragraph quoted above, the effective date of which was July 1, 1919. An appeal was taken from the order by the Fanners company and a bond therefor was duly given. Thereafter the cause was heard in the supreme court of this state, where the order of the Com - mission was reversed. Blackledge v. Farmers Independent Telephone Co., 1S1 N. W. 709. The court held that the statute providing for a physical connection be - tween telephone companies applies to companies operating "trunk and toll" lines and contemplates forwarding messages only when such lines are used. In ccnsidering the statute relating to physical connection between telephone companies the court uses this language: (p. 711 1 "The principle of requiring such physical connection of lines in furtherance of public service and for the public convenience was first recognized as applied to railroads. Michigan Central R. Co. v. Michigan Railroad Commission, 236 I". S. 615. 35 Sup. Ct. 422. 59 L. Ed. 7nO: Wisconsin, M. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, 179 U. S. 267. 21 Sup. Ct. 115, 45 L. Ed. 194: State of Washington v. FaircttUd, 224 D. S. 510, 32 Sup. Ct. 535, 56 L. Ed. s6:'.. "When a telephone company procures a connection, go as to be allowed the use of long-distance wires of another, or where two com - panies arc required to connect their longdistance toll lines, the toll charges, being based on distance of transmission of messages, may be so apportioned that each company will get compensation for just such part of the services that it renders in the transmission of each individual message. To that extent there is a clear analogy in principle to the rule as applied to railroad companies, where the transportation charges are automatically apportioned between the two companies, one company receiving compensation for that part of the service rendered up to. and the other beyond, the i&lt;&gt;nnecting point. "Where two telephone companies are competiting tor local busi - ness and one of them has long-distance lines which it has been com - pelled, by a regulatory order, to furnish to the patrons of the other company, it has, in some instances, been found necessary, in order to maintain an equality between the companies and to insure a proper compensation to the company furnishing additional service, to provide a switching charge against patrons of the other company, to be collected in addition to the regular toll rates charged to the subscribers of the company having the long-distance lines.

Wright-Dickinson Hotel Co., supra." </seg>
            <seg id="p042">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 115 In diaeBMiBg the third section of the decision of the Railway Com mission, the court said: (pp. 712-713) "The matter of the fixation and adjustment of the conditions and of rates, where an exchange of service is ordered, is one exclusively for the Railway Commission, and not for the courts. The one func - tion of the court is to determine whether such an order as has been made can be legally justified. The Commission has apparently not attempted to work out a system of rates and charged which woula work as an equitable foundation for an exchange of service, and this may have been for the reason that it considered such could not be done. However that may be, the findings of the Commission show that the Lincoln Company has sustained a considerable loss of patronage by reason of the Farmers' Company's competition, which has the advantage of local ownership; and the Commission further rinds that the requirements /or an exchange of local and long-distance Berries, as covered by those portions of the order that we have just discussed, will in practical effect work a confiscation of the Lincoln Company's property through the process of a complete loss of its local subscribeis to the other company, unless some provision is made in the order which will iiffcrd protection. Such an order, to bp sustained, must be one that will operate reasonably, and not be arbitrary, nor violate constitutional inhibitions. Unless a reasonable adjustment can be made where the Lincoln Company can be pro - tected against such a detriment and substantial loss as the Rail - way Commission's findings shows that it will otherwise suffer, it seems clear to us that this company cannot legally be forced to fur - nish either long-distance or local service to the patrons of its rrom - petitor. Pioneer Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. State, supra, 77 Okl. 216. 1S6 Pac. M4. For. as s;&gt;.id in the case just cited: " A connection, under rules and regulations that amount to the destruction of property, or that works a discrimination against the subscribers of either exchange, would amount to the taking of prop - el tv without due process of law. The state, of course, has the power to take private property for public use under its rights of eminent domain; but this can only be done for a fair consideration. The section of the Constitution contemplates the physical connection and the regulation of such union under the police powers of the state.' "The order of tlie_ Railway Commission contains a prevision calculated to protect the Lincoln Company; it is that all near busi - ness shall be divided in such proportions between the companies that the relation in size of the one company to the other shall not change but shall be continuously maintained throusriiout all futuro growth, or so Ions as the order lor exchange of service shaU operate. â¢'Serious inconvenience is a necessary result of having tvo local telephone companies in operation side by side, jpd, though such duplication cannot be justified from an economic standpoint, it must be . remembered that these companies each received a franchise to operate in the sam-3 locality and that they have ftullt plants aud extended their lin&gt;:&gt; th.oi ;&gt;,hout the territory f ranted.

They not only have the right to seek subscribers in the te:ritory where they are operat - ing, but all persons wishing to become sub-soribe 1 s have the recipro- </seg>
            <seg id="p043">116 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT * ca! right to demand that they shall bo.jm-.? such subscribers ami that the service of that public utility wiUek they choose shall be rendered to them. To grant to such a company the right to con - struct a telephone line, and then late:- to riiny it the right to have all persons along that line connect wt*h it aa subscribers, is to take away the very grant, that has been given. It h io deny the company the Very use of the property for which the property was especially constructed. Statutes have been passed in some states providing that a public utility shall not extend its lines into new territory unless it shall have procured a certificate from a regulator-, commission. showing that the territory is no:, already adequately warvd and that public necessity and convenience reqrire additional service. The order here cannot be justified on the principles underlying those reg - ulations. Those regulations, when within reasor.&amp;ti'^ limits, do not affect vested rights, but deal only with an extension of grants to such companies into territory not theretofore served bv them. We do not hesitate to say that the order of the' Railway Commission requiring the division of new business, cannct be legally Instilled, Had is fhe taking of property rights without due process of law. "(5) The provision as to the division of such new boaisesa is ,&lt;i correlated and interdependent with the other provisions of the order that it cannct be separated from them. The order of the Railway Commission in this case is an entirety. It cannot be divided into separate and independent orders. It is, furthermore, a regulation legislative in character, and cannot be modified or changed by thi^ court. The order .as found, must, so far as the power of this court goes, be either approved or set aside. Omaha &amp; C. B. Street R. Co. v. Nebraska State Railway Commission. 103 Neb. 695. 17-f N.

"For the reasons given, the order of -the Railway Commission is annulled and set aside, without prejudice to the rights of any of the parties concerned to further proceedings before the Commission. for the purpose of arriving at some reasonable regulation for the exchange of service, under such conditions, if they can be found in this case, as will be legally justifiable and within constitutional limits." The essential portion of the motion of the Lincoln company now be - fore us is as follows: "Your cross petitioner therefore moves the Commission for the entry of an order permitting it to discontinue furnishing toll iine service and toll line connection to the said Farmers Independent Telephone Company, in coonformity with the prayer of its cross peti tion on file in said cause and in conformity with the opinion and order of the Supreme Court entered therein, and for such other addi - tional relief as it may be entitled to in said proceedings." The essential portion of the motion of the Farmers company is as follows: "Wherefore your cross petitioner moves the Commission for an </seg>
            <seg id="p044">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 117 order requiring the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to continue to furnish the subscribers of the Farmers Independent Co. toll line connections and service as prayed for by this cross petitioner in its answer and reply heretofore filed with the Commission and in accord - ance with the opinion and order of the Supreme Court and for such further and ether relief as it may be entitled to in the above cause." Hearing was had upon the motions, which were submitted at the same time. The Lincoln company offered testimony showing the number ot subscribers it had lost as a result of the action of the Farmers com - pany in 1917; that it had regained only about 24 of theso who had dis - continued its service and that it had only 219 subscribers on December 31, 1920, as against 2S8 on June 30, 1916; that it had increased its coun - try subscribers only 30 since the suit was instituted, that it was main - taining its service at Red Cloud at a heavy loss, and that such loss was likely to continue unless it were given relief by way of permission to discontinue its long distance service to the Farmers company. The testimony on behalf of the Lincoln company was offered principally by It. E. Mattison, its general manager, who has been connected with the ( ompany for many years. There was some testimony offered by the Farmers company, but there is nothing that really contravenes the testimony of the Lincoln company as to the losses it is sustaining and that it is likely to sustain in the future by reason of the continuance of the long distance service. The witnesses were interrogated as to any pos - sible plan that might permit the long distance service to be continued to be given by the Lincoln company to the Farmers company and yet adequately protect the interests of the Lincoln company. Various methods were suggested and discussed, but no plan was offered which would be feasible and would adequately protect the Lincoln company. We therefore find that no plan has been presented that would ade - quately protect the Lincoln company or prevent it from continually losing subscribers to the Farmers company if the long distance service is rendered; or prevent it from operating at a loss if present conditions continue. We also find that the only method by which a confiscation of the Lincoln Company's property may be prevented is the cutting off of the long distance service rendered by it to the Farmers company's sub - scribers. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph company be, and it hereby is authorized to sever the physical connection now existing between its exchange at Red Cloud, Nebraska, and the ex - change of the Farmers Independent Telephone company at that city, and to discontinue the long-distance service now furnished the sub - scribers of the Fanners Independent Telephone company. </seg>

The two lines of road intersect two and one-half miles east of the Burlington depot at Wymore and run close to each other very nearly paralleling in a northwesterly direction for about one mile; the Union Pacific line being on the northeast side of the Burlington for this dis - tance. The Burlington line then takes a more westerly direction into the station at Wymore. The Union Pacific takes a more northerly direction and passes about one-half mile east of the east line of Wymore corpora - tion limits to East Blue Springs, Holmesville and Beatrice. Adjacent to and on the north side of the Union Pacific, where it parallels the Bur - lington, there is a large stone quarry which ships rock in carload lots, varying from four hundred to five hundred cars per year. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 119 The two railrcads have private spur tracks on their respective lines to handle tins traffic. The Union Pacific traffic is loaded directly from the rock crusher to the cars by a chute. That which goes to the Bur - lington must be hauled from the chute of the rock crusher across both tracks and put onto a dump irom which it is loaded into the cars. The round trip is about fifteen hundred feet. The testimony is that five hundred ninety-four cars were so loaded on the Burlington in 1912 at a cost of $2.00 per car and that the cost now is $4.00 per car. The Burlingtcn railroad serves by far the greater number of towns in that teritory and all rock from the quarry for Burlington points must be transferred at Beatrice, where there is a connecting track, or loaded on the Burlington spur at the rock quarry, as above described. The rec - ord does not show that any stone has been transferred at Beatrice. There is an ice industry on the Union Pacific at Blue Springs which is about two and one-half miles north of where it is proposed that track connections be made. This plant ships between four and five thousand tens annually. In order to reach points east of Wymore on the main line of the Burlington, the ice must move north to Beatrice, a distance of 13.6 miles, and back to Wymore over the Burlington, a distance of twelve miles, making approximately 20.6 miles farther for the car to nove than it would If it mcved south to the proposed connection and thence west to Wymore. For traffic going to points east of Wymore on the Burlington from Blue Springs on the Union Pacific by way of Be - atrice, the distance is 25.6 miles greater. The Rawlings ice plant is located on the Burlington at Wymore, about two and one-half miles west of the proposed connection. The plant has a storage capacity of between thirty-five and forty thousand tons and ships between five and six hundred cars per year. All cars going into Union Pacific territory south of Wymore must be routed north by way of the Burlington to Beatrice, there transferred to the Union Pacific, thence south to points of destination. The defendants have submitted studies showing the interchange of carload traffic at Be - atrice from November 1916, to April 1920, which show that approxi - mately five hundred cars were interchanged between the two lines. Out of this number, considering the points of origin and those of destination, there were approximately fifty cars that should have been transferred at Wymore had there been transfer facilities. There are spur tracks and loading facilities on both roads at the rock quarry ample to move the rock traffic with dispatch, but all rock loaded on the Burlington line is done so at about $4.00 per car extra ex - pense because of the haulage by trucks or wagons. The record shows that a large amount of rip rap rock is loaded on the Burlington which cannot be loaded through the chute. That being true, it would not </seg>
            <seg id="p047">120 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT make any difference to the rock company whether it loaded on the Bur - lington tracks or on the Union Pacific tracks. If a connection were made between the two roads, the only savins to the rock company would be the difference between the $4.00 per car and a proper transfer switching charge, which would be authorized by the Commission if the connection were made. The record does not show what 'the switching charge should be at this particular point, but it certainly would not be an appreciable amount less than $4.00. There - fore, there would not be an appreciable saving to the rock industry if the connection were made. Mr. Hawlinsis can reach the entire Burlington territory because his plant is located on that road. He has access to all Union Pacific points north of Beatrice through the connection at that point. The only ad - vantage that the connection would be to him is that it would enable him to reach Union Pacific points south of Wymort and Holmesville which are between East Blue Springs and Beatrice. It is impossible from the rtcord to say how much ice Mr. Rawlings would ship to that territory He does state that in 1919 lie sold approximately his entire output to the Armour Packing company, which is located on the Burlington in Omaha. In other years he sold large quantities to the Union Pacific and to the Pacific Fruit Express company, which company operates cars over the Union Pacific lines. In selling to the Union Pacific Railroad company or to the Pacific Fruit Express company, Mr. Rawlings found that it was necessary for him to deliver his ice to that road at Beatrice, which made it necessary Cor him to ship from his plant to Beatrice over the Burlington, upon which he had to pay the charges for the one line haul. Mr. Rawlings urges that if transfer facilities between the two roads were installed at one of the designated points the Union Pacific Railroad company would receive the ice at the transfer at the same price that it would pay him for it at Beatrice and that all he would be out in delivering the ice to the Union Pacific company would be the switching charge between his plant and the connection, and that he would save the difference between such a charge and the charge for the road haul between his plant and Beatrice by way of the Bur - lington. The fact that the Union Pacific Railroad company prefers to take the ice over its own line at Beatrice does not give Mr. Rawlings a claim for a connection at Wymore. The Union Pacific should charge "or the transportation of the ice a proper road haul between the proposed connection at Wymore and Beatrice. It is also urged that the rate from Wymore to Omaha would be for a one line haul and therefore less than the sum of the locals by way of the Burlington and the Union Pacific through the transfer switch at Beatrice. That is possibly true, but if the traffic is sufficient to warrant a connecting track installed at Wymore, it certainly would justify the Commission in establishing a joint rate for the traffic moving- over the Burlington and the Union Pacific </seg>
            <seg id="p048">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 121 wnich would reduce the charge and make That less than the sum of the two locals. It is hard to discuss the matter without taking up questions which properly belong in a rate case. We are of the opinion that If proper joint rates were established from Wymore by the way of the Bur - lington to points on the Union Pacific north of Beatrice a connecting :iack would not be of material benefit to Mr. Rawlings. The ice plant at East Blue Springs has a capacity of between four and five thousand tons. It suppliesc Union Pacific points and has access to all Burlington points north, east and west of Beatrice through the &lt; onnection at that point. There would be some advantage to that in - dustry by the proposed connection in that it would afford a more direct route to Burlington points east and west of Wymore. The Commission cannot say what amount of all other traffic orig - inating on each of the lines of roads destined to points on the other line should be transferred at Wymore without a complete analysis of the subject. We are of the opinion that such studies should have been made, but in their absence our conclusions will have to be based upon that which is before us. We are of the opinion that the plaintiffs herein and other interested ]&gt;aities should be given an opportunity to supply the record with such studies and any other data that would enable the Commission to arrive at a just conclusion, and that the matter should be dismissed without prejudice. We have carefully considered the probable cost of the installation and maintenance of the proposed connection, that of operation, policing Mid inspection of cars to be transferred, and the fact that the location is out in the country, the advantage to shippers as to convenience, time ;;nd money saved, and from all the facts before us we are unable to say that the connection should be made.

FINAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: This complaint, which Involved service furnished by the irrigation company, a common carrier under the Nebraska law. was heard at Lexington. Nebraska. March 1U and 11. 192o. Complainants ask spe - cifically: I. That defendant clean out iis ditch to its orogiaal capacity '1. That supervision by the company be improved to a point to prevent the unauthorized taking: ot water through lateral measuring boxes or thrcuph (he bank itself. 3. Thai the company be reuired to maintain ditch riders daring the irrigation .season. 4. That defendant be required each year to keep water flowing in its ditch from April 1 to November 1. 5. That defendant be forbidden to sell extra water to Ike detri - ment of permanent water right owners. 6. That more adequate measuring boxes be installed The evidence in the case clearly showed that the ditch was not properly maintained during the year 1919 and that as a result full meas - ure of benefit from the use of the water was denied to the water right owners and the users of water. Inasmuch as ti'ne for improvements wa. - limited a temporary order was issued by the Commission requiring the company to proceed at cnce to the cleaning out of the ditch, certain specific points being designated, and the minimum size cf the ditch for service to the existing water right owners was set forth in the tem - porary order. The company has operated under this temporary order to the present lime. It is now essential that the case be finally dis - ]K&gt;sed of. As to the points in the complaint set out above the Commission specifically finds as follows: 2. There was insufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion that </seg>
            <seg id="p050">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 123 water was being taken out of the ditch from holes in the banks in an un - authorized manner. Some evidence rather indicated that this had been done in one instance, but the opposing evidence was to the effect that the water was overflowing at that point and the land owner merely took advantage ol" the waste water. The company has maintained a sufficient ditch riding organiza- tion. 4. It is not essential that water be in the ditch on April 1 of each season. Normally the first calls for water occur about June and the spring months are used few maintenance work. In a particularly dry spring there would be no reason for having water in the ditch earlier than would be the case in a normal year. Rigid rules as to the time for turning on the water would be a waste of efficiency. It should be governed entirely by the needs of the water right owners. The defendant denied that it had ever sold extra water wlien the water right owners were receiving an additional supply of water ;iui Bince tliH date of the hearing, at least, it appears that it has not -lone SO 6. Inspection of the ditcli indicated some inadequate measuring boxes at the take-off of laterals serving individual users of water. The evidence warranted the requirement of an improvement in this respect. Such improvement has taken place to a large degree, as shown V&gt;y re - port made by the company to the Commission on May 10, 1921. as to activities in 1920. The company, should continue the replacement pro - gram until the measuring boxes alcng the entire line are in efficient operating condition. 1. There remains only the contention of complainants that th&gt; (ie - posit of silt in the ditch should be removed to a degree which would li aw the ditcli in its original carrying capacity. This coupled conten - tion of the complainants brought out in the hearing that the ditch should have a capacity at all times sufficient to supply all necessary water to Til users of water at the same time. We will deal with these two con - tentions separately. Tlu- ditch was originally constructed with a capaciiy sufficient to irrigate twelve thousand acres of land. The region served by the ditch ;s a twilight region between territory which is irrigated not at all and territory which relies upon irrigation almost exclusively. Rainfall, while somewhat uncertain, is sufficiently abundant tc discourage the purchase of water rights, even at the low price at which they have been sold by this company, to such an extent that a full acreage proposed to be irri - gated has never been sold. At the present time active water rights total 6.135.32 acres. It appears perfectly clear to this Commission that a </seg>
            <seg id="p051">124 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT ditch, which in its original construction was oÂ£ sufficient capacity to serve twice this acreage, need not be continued in such size. Indee&lt;t. the mere lack of use of the full proportion of water, by reason of limited acreage watered, would, if the matter were tested, be sufficient reason to forfeit a portion of the proportion. If such forfeiture were to take place the company would not be entitled to enough water to fill a ditch â¢ o its original capacity. The ditch should at all times be of sufficient size to water the acreage served and should be maintained in such condition as to give maximum efficiency. That size, we think, is amply covered by the provisions or the temporary order herein and those pro - visions will be approved in this final order. There is no evidence in the record that it is a practice of irrigation companies to supply facilities of sufficient size to furnish water to ail water ri^ht users at the same time if tiiey so desire. On the contrary it appears to be the ordinary practice of the supervisors of private irri - gation companies and of public irrigation districts to distribute the period of using so that the users of water may take a surplus amount for a certain period, thereby spreading the water to a greater advantage, and then yield to others in rotation. Following tlie temporary order herein the company put to work a &lt;l.rag line excavator on the ditch and. with the exception of a period when it was used to repair a break on the main canal west of the lake, it worked the entire season on the ditch and thoroughly cleaned it and enlarged it from the in-take to station No. 632. Report of the company to the Commission, under the terms of the temporary order, indicates that there was removed 37,535 yards ol 'fill, an amount in excess of the fill on the entire ditch, as same was read into the record by the engine- i - fcr complainants. Not all of the ditch has as yet been thoroughlv re - constructed. During the period when jurisdiction of the Commission re - mains alive the company will be required, in so far as its capacity erables it to do so, to continue the repair program on the lower part of the ditch up to the capacity set forth in the temporary order of April 26. 1920.

Chairman: This is a complaint died on behalf of citizens residing in towns served by the branch of the Chicago.Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad com - pany extending from Palmer to Burwell. Complaint was originally di - rected to Walker D. Hine^. director general of the United States rail - load administration, but upon the return of the roads to private control rhe railroad company was substituted as defendant. The complaint al - leges inadequate passenger service on the branch referred to an.l asks that an additional passenger train each way daily be required of de - fondant by this commission, such service to include at least cne Sunday train each way. The complaint w&amp;a filed on January 6, 1920, but at the request oi complainants hearing was deferred awaiting the return of de - fendant company to priva'e operation. Subsequent to the hearing defend - ant delayed submission oi its brief for the purpose of making .some ltT-fljustmentE in service on the branch and to learn the results from same, this brief not being filed until August 21, 1920. Defendant hr.s a branch leaving its Lincoln-Billings line at Aurora and runninar north from Central City to Palmer. At the latter point this branch divides, one line running north and west to Burwell and the other bran' li extending west and north to Sargent. The fork extending to Eurwell has a branch leaving Greeley and running to Ericson. The service on each of these branches consists of one passenger train each way daily except Sunday and one local freight each way daily except Sunday. There are occasional extra freight trains for the handling of live stock and other commodities. The passenger trains consolidate at Palmer and operate as one train between that point and Aurora. Com - plainants now ask that an added passenger train be installed to operate from Burwell to Aurora and return, operating seven days in the week. As stated, defendant assumed from the record made in this case that delayed service was the chief cause of complaint and upon that as - sumption proposed and instituted certain changes which it thought v.'ould remedy the situation. This consisted of changing the terminus' of the Lincoln freight train No. 49 from Aurora to Palmer and installing a larger turntable at the latter point to accommodate the heavier engines </seg>
            <seg id="p053">126 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Eid on this freight. The baggage car on the passenger train now kes the through run from Lincoln to Bui well, which obviates the nec- Ity of a transfer of baggage and express at Palmer. This transfer consumed from twenty to forty minutes time, with consequent delay to the train for the remainder of its trip up the branch. Complainants in - sist, however, that these changes do not meet their objections to the service and they renew their demand for an added train. . !In support of their demand for increased passenger service, they lphasize the growth and development of the territory served by the fendant and submit evidence with reference to increased population creased bank deposits, enhanced land values, and consequent growth railroad traffic They aJso submit some testimony with reference to e construction of public buildings and other improvements in the towns served by the branch. It is their contention that these evidences of material growth of the communities justify the request for more pas- Enger service. The service now furnished is substantially the MOftc that provided- when the branch was first built.' There have been me changes, but for the greater portion of the period there has been six-day passenger service. The lack ol a Sunday train ereatly delays e delivery of mail so that mail forwarded on Saturday cannot reach ints on the branch until the following Monday evening and sometinie. - delayed until Tuesday. It is contended also that express shipments p delayed to such an extent that fresh fruits and vegetables are de - livered so late in the afternoon and evening that they cannot be delivered to merchants for sale the same day and that damage by spoilage results &gt;y their being kept in the depots over night. This testimony is not nppcrted by evidence and it is not clear that the addition of another ain would result in any material improvement. In other words, it is :&gt;own that at the present time delivery is made to merchants the same ight the train arrives and there is but Ht lie occasion for shipments âº ing damaged. Much of this fruit comes from Grand Island and with a morning train up the branch delivery to the carrier would have to be made so early in the morning thai it could not be accepted for the branch rain. Complainants rely also on the claim of discrimination, in that this j.rrticular branch has less service than the two branches of the Union Pacific operating on either side. The branch of the Union Pacific extending from Grand Island to Ord has two passenger trains each way daily and one passenger train en Sunday. A similar service exists on the Union Pacific branch from Columbus to Spalding. Points such as Scotia, North Loup and Ord on the Grand Island branch, and Spaldine Cedar Rapids and Belgrade on the Spalding branch are competitive to rrns like dishing, Wolbach, Greeley and Ord on the Burlington branch, is urged that considerable traffic moves from Burlington territory these Union Pacific points on either side and that as a cOBfteqnasce </seg>
            <seg id="p054">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 127 the development of Burlington communities is retarded and citizens residing therein are denied the same conveniences as are enjoyed by their neighbors in the other towns. There is some evidence that people drive to I'liicn Pacific point s to take advantage of more frequent ser- vice, although the extent of that is not disclosed by the record. The monthly station reports to this Commission, covering the traffic originat- ing and received at each station of the Union Pacific and Burlington. were made a part cf this record. A summary Ji" the figures contained in these reports furnishes a fair basis of comparison as uetween the various branch lines involved in this proceeding. Taking the calendar year 191&lt;J, the total traffic for the branches was as follows: Palmer-Burwelt bramh, C. B. &amp; Q $3TJ:,SW.72 Palmer-Sursient branch, C. B. &amp; Q 455.717.13 ('.rand Island-Ord branch, l"nion Pacific 398,551.86 Columbus-Albion branch. I'niun Pacific 389,226.00 (Vlumbus-Spalding branch. Union Pacific 463, 263.01) These totals are determined as to the Palmer-Burwell and Palmer- Sargent branches by allocating the revenues derived from the line from Aurora to Palmer on a basis of fifty per cent to each branch. The same applies with reference to the Columbus-Spalding line and the Columbus- Albion line, the revenues derived from the line Columbus to Genoa be- inp: divided in the same manner. It shculd be explained that the revenues received at Aurora and at Columbus are eliminated for the reason that they very largely accrue to the main line. In the same manner the revenues from ticket sales, which are a part of the total receipts shown above, are determined and are as follows Palmer-Burwell branch, C. B. &amp; Q $57.S08.13 Palmer-Sargent branch. C. B. &amp; Q 57,678.11 Grand Island-Ord branch. Union Pacific 65,604.25 Columbus-Albion branch. Union Pacific 58,682.84 Columbus-SpaldinK branch, Union Pacific 60,353.34 Only reports for the first ten months of the year 1920 are aailable ;tt this time. The figures as total traffic and ticket sales for these ten months for the branches are as follows: Total Ticket Traffic Sales. Palmer-Burwell branch. C. B. &amp; Q $495,122.42 $46,496.79 Palmer-Sargent branch. C. B. &amp; Q 529,773.64 46,302.14 {Jrand Island-Ord branch, U. P 365,553.71 56,924.98 Columbus-Albion branch, U.

P 506.401.40 54.880.70 Traffic during the months of November and December fell off sharply so that an extension of the figures for the ten months to cover a period of a year wou'd probably not reflect the actual experience for the full year 1920. It is manifest, however, that the traffic for this year exceeded by a considerable margin the business for the previous year. It will </seg>
            <seg id="p055">128 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT be noted that the live branches are strikingly similar in so tar as traffic is concerned. This is particularly true with reference to passenger business. These traffic figures by no means indicate that the revenue Ebown accrues wholly to the branches involved. A very large portion of this revenue very properly belongs to other portions of the system. The figures, however, are valuable lor comparative purposes. It Will be pointed out that the second passenger train operating on the Spalding branch was ordered by this Commission after a hearing and investigation and that the train operating on the Albion line was installed so that similar service might be provided for that branch. While this is true, it is necessary to bear in mind that the order made by the Commission In that case was at a time when conditions were normal as t&lt;f operating costsâ a situation that does not now prevail. This record shows, and the figure is borne out by the experience and studies of the Commission, that operating costs of passenger trains in .1919 were 74.34 per cent greater than in 1916. The cost would be some - what higher at the present time. The Commission la of the opinion, therefore, that it would not be justified in requiring defendant to install a second daily passenger train on the I'alnier-Burwell branch at this time. It is necessary to take into consideration in this connection that in all probability a similar train woulti have to be installed on the- Palmer- Sargent branch, although service on that branch is not now under criti - cism. There yet remains, however, the question of the Sunday service. The record clearly establishes the disability which complainants suffer iron the lack of a passenger train operating on Sunday. Not only does this inconvenience and disability apply to the delivery of the mail, but it affects with equal force the convenience and necessities of people who desire to travel from place to place on the branch on that day. At the present time a person desiring to travel on Sunday must drive to 1 oints on the Union Pacific, as previously stated. As pointed out by the defendant, it has been the traditional polity of the Burlington not to operate Sunday trains on branch lines and it is urged because of that fact that an exception should not be made in this instance. Twelve or fifteen Burlington branches in Nebraska and neighboring states are cited as not having Sunday service. The duty of the carrier to fur - nish passenger service is measured somewhat by the policy of other roads operating in the same territory. The maintenance of Sunday serv - ice on parallel branches of a competing road throws into greater relief The absence of such service on defendant's lines. This applies to daily service as well, but, as we have shown, operating conditions do not at this time warrant such an extensive addition to the service as the in - stallation of a second train. We are of the opinion, however, that Sun - day passenger service should be provided. Defendant cites the case of </seg>
            <seg id="p056">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 129 Great Northern Railroad Company vs. Cahill, 40 S. C. R. 457, and a previous case of the fame nature, Great Northern Ry. vs. Minnesota, 238 U. S. 340-45, as authority (or the proposition that a railroad company cannot be compelled to furnish service, notwithstanding the public may be bene - fitted thereby. The cases cited are not in point. They involve the right of the state to require the installation of stock scales, which th* court held to be no part of the facilities for transportation. They were rierely a convenience, voluntarily provided by carriers in certain in - stances, but were not required for any purpose connected with trans - rortation. The court very properly held, as stated in Great Northern Ky. vs. Minnesota, supra, that "The business of a railroad is transportation and to supply the public with a convenience not connected therewith is no part ol its ordinary duty." Defendant is not asked in this case to furnish anything out oi its line of duty as a common carrier. It is only asked to furnish more ade - quate transportation, a duty wholly within its obligation. The neces - sities and conveniences of the public are, therefore, prime factors in determining whether increased service should be provided. As we have stated, it is not possible from this record to ascertain positively whether the present traffic on this branch is being handled at a profit. Complicated allocation of revenues and expenses between the branch and the remainder of The system would be necessary before such a result could be determined. We do know, however, that the system as a whole has been abundantly prosperous, the evidence on that point being undisputed. It is well settled that, public necessity and conven - ience demanding, a railroad company may properly be required to fur - nish some service at a loss provided its business as a whole is suffi - ciently profitable to warrant the additional cost. We are of the opinion, therefore, that Sunday service should be established at least tor a trial period of six months. If during that per - iod the patronage is approximately equal to that for any one day of the week it would indicate that the service should be continued permanently. We find, therefore, that the reecrd justifies the installation of Sunday service within a reasonable time and an order to that effect will be issued.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER Taylor, Chairman: Subsequent to the issuance of ihe original order in this cast*. D. A. Beach, and other citizens living on defendant's line from Palmer to Sargent, filed a complaint a-.-.king that Sunday train service be installed on that branch. The order in this case requiring a trial of Sunday serv - ce on the Palmer-Burwell branch is cited in the complaint and it is al - eged that conditions r.n the Palmer-Sargent branch are similar to those hich the Ccmmirsion found to warrant a trial of the service on the other ranch. Before the hearing on the second complaint, which is Formal Complaint No. 420. could be had, defendant filed a motion pravins iat the experimental peiiod for Sunday train service on the Burwel! ranch be reduced trom six months to three months; that Formal Com - laint No. 420 be consolidated with the complaint in this case: ani o, - ering, fhculd such reduction of the period be granted, to install .Sun - ay service on the Sargent branch fcr a like trial. Argument on this motion was had before the Commission on Friday. March IS. 1921, at which all parties were represented. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 131 It is urged on behalf of the defendant that the installation of Sun - day service on either branch is certain to result in a loss and that a trial period of six months would, therefore, result in twice the amount of loss as would follow from the trial for three months. It was sfÂ£teJ, however .that the company is willing to make a trial and that it is of the opinion the test should be made en both branches at the sum? time in view of the relation of these branches to each other Iron) an operating standpoint. Complainants in this case (Formal Compla'ni No. 399) object to any reduction in the time of the trial period, first, on the ground that they made their ease be.'ore the Commission and secured on order favorable to them to the extent that it provided for a six months' trial and that they should not now be asked to surrender the advantage thus secured; and second, that the period asked for is not sufficient to fully determine whether the traffic will justify continuation of the train. Complainants in Formal Complaint No. 420, while prefer - 7 ing :i longer test period, offer but slight objection to the more limited test. The Commission is strongly of the opinion that the test should be made on both branches simultaneously. Daily trains are operated down the branches to Palmer where they are consolidated and operated as one train from Palmer tc Aurora, a distance of about forty miles. Re - turning, the consolidated train divides at Palmer. The cost of opera - tion, therefore, from Palmer to Aurora and return would remain prac - tically the same whether the service were operated on one branch or Loth. On the other hand, the consolidated traffic between Palmer and Aurora would contribute to a more favorable showing for the new service. We have given careful consideration as to whether or not the period of three months is of sufficient length tc test the service and reach the conclusion that it will answer perhaps as well as a longer period. If the trains should be run at a substantial less, as defend - ant contends they will be, the loss should not be continued longer than is necessary. If, on the other hand, the tranffic is sufficient to justify the retention of the trains the length of the trial period will be im - material because the service will thus become permanent. It is sug - gested that changing financial conditions may make the present a rather inopportune time for a test and that a gradual improvement might call for a longer trial before it could be regarded as normal. If such gradual improvement should develop the test period might be extended by the Commission. We are of the cpinion, therefore, that the motion of the Burlington should be granted; that the test period on the Burwell tine should be reduced from six months to three months; that the two com - plaints should be consolidated and both set for hearing at a date Immed - iately fol'cwing the termination of the three months' trial period; that the company should keep a detailed record of the traffic on the daily Sunday trains on both branches and this data should be submitted to </seg>

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman: This matter arises on a motion made by complainants following the submission of evidence at a hearing in Central City on July 8, 1921. In the supplemental finding and order in these cases defendant was re - quired tc install Sunday train service on the Burwell-Sargent branches lor a period cf three months and to make a complete showing of the results of operation for this test period. It was represented by defend - ant at the hearing that the figures for June were not available and could not be compiled in time to be submitted at the hearing. Its showing, therefore, was confined to the results of operation for the months of April and May only. Defendant announced that it would be August 1 before the June figures would be available. Upon informal request of the Commission defendant extended the operation cf its train to July 3. At the conclusion of the submission of evidence complainants filed a motion asking that the hearing be con- Mnued until such time as defendant could submit complete figures for ihe test period, the Sunday service as provided in the supplemental order to be continued until such hearing could be had and finding made on the merits by the Commission. It was urged by complainants on argument that defendants did not comply with the order of the Com - mission lor the submission of complete data with reference to the re - sults of the trial period, and that such failure justified an order re - quiring continuation of the trial service. On this point there appears to be ample justification for the carrier's failure to make the showing as ordered. Revenues and expenses are not submitted to the audit - ing department in time for compilation at the end of each month. Rather elaborate allocations must be made in a case of this character, which require time. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the carrier should not be charged with willful negligence in its failure to submit all of the figures for the three months periodd. It is essential, however, that these figures be secured before a final conclusion is reached wiih Perence to a continuation of the Sunday service. In its supplemental order the Commission provided for a test period of three months on the asumption that that would be long enough to uetermine wether or not the earnings would justify making the service permanent. It should be recalled in this connection that the defendant voluntarily offered to install Sunday service on the Palmer-Sargont branch in consideration of the reduction of the trial period from six months to three months. Refusal of the Commission to reduce the trial period would no doubt have resulted in an appeal of the Palmer-Burwell branch case and a long delay in its final determination. In cases </seg>
            <seg id="p061">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL, REPORT 134 involving tests of new and additional service this Commission holds it highly essential to act in good faith with all parties concerned. Service was ordered on these branches for three months in order to ascertain whether or not it could be maintained permanently. Defendant has com - l.lied with the test, operating the train one trip more than was required. Conditions now are such as they were when the service was installed. There appears to be no reason to believe, therefore, that a continuation of ihe service throughout the month of July would add anything to the information necessary to determine the question as to whether or not the train should be continued. We are of the opinion, therefore, and so find, that the motion of complainants should be overruled. In order to expedite the final determination of the case the matter will be set down for hearing on August 3, 1921, at Central City, at which time defendant should be prepared to submit final figures for the test periodd, including those for tlip mcnth of June.

            <seg id="p062">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 OPINION AND T INDING. Taylor, Chairman: Complainants are live stock buyers and shippers at Aurora, Nebraska and in addition to buying and shipping- for themselves act as agents in purchasing and shipping hogs for two of the large packing companies During the year ending with the date of the filing of this complaint oo August 14, 1920, they had shipped hot less than 618 cars of live stock. :t portion of which either originated at Aurora or was shipped through there and stopped for feeding and care at that point. The complainants a liege that the railroad company has spacious and commodious yards at Aurora, with good watering facilities; that the service rendered by the company at its stockyards is poor and inadequate (1) because the quality of corn furnished and fed to hogs has in many instances been .so poor as to be practically worthless; (2) because full measure and weight of corn is not given to shippers; (3) because the watering troughs receive very poor care and attention so that moat of the time Miey are full of mud, trash and other filth; (4) because the treatment extended to shippers by the yard superintendent in charge is impolite, discourteous and abusive; and (5) because it makes a charge of twenty - five cpnts per bushel in addition to the regular price of $2.50 per bushel where a second feeding cf corn is required. Hearing on the complaint was held at Aurora and the pricinpal testi - mony in behalf of complainants was given by Russell Bird, a member of tlie firm cf Hillis &amp; Bird. His chief complaint seemed to be that Jack Abbott, manager or superintendent cf the local yards, was unreasonable in his treatment of shippers, abusive and profane in his language, and that coin sold by him was short in weight and in one instance poor in miality. He cited one case where corn, after being purchased from Mr. Abbott, was taken to the scales and weighed, one lot cf six bushels weighing short seventy-six pounds and another lot of three bushels weighing short forty-six pounds. Sheriff Howard cf Hamilton county witnessed the weighing and attested on the stand to the weights as above stated. Mr. Bird testified that at one time black and discolored corn was fed to his hogs. He said this corn was of such poor quality that the hogs would not eat it and, notwithstanding its condition, he was charged the regular price of $2.50 per bushel. He gave an instance where Abbott had cursed his partner, Mr. Hillis. and said that lie was prone to get mad and find fault. He admitted, however, that he had 'â¢eard Mr. Hills swear at Mr. Abbott, but asserted that it was only after Mr. Abbott had provoked the quarrel. Bert Rinehardt, a farmer and occasional stock shipper, recited an incident in which Mr. Abbott in an arbitrary manner ordered him away trap the front gate of the yards and inquired in an abusive manner the purpose of his presence in the yards. On another occasion Abbott repri- </seg>

It was stipulated that imony of Theodore Widdeman, Amos Moore, James Kerr, and M. die would be similar to that given by Mr. Rinehart. The defense presented testimony of a number of local farmers and ippers who patronize the yards. Lee Shike, who was feeding stock on ugust 4 and 14, 1920, dates on which the alleged poor corn was sold y defendant, stated that he purchased one hundred bushels of the orn and fed it to his stock with very satisfactory results and was of the pinion that the corn was very good feed. Carl Bergstrand, a farmer ho ships from the yards occasionally, also purchased some of the same orn and got good results from its feeding. Shike and Bergstrand pur - based the corn fcr seventy-five cents and $1.00 per bushel, respectively. '. E. Garrett, who buys, feeds and ships stock at Aurora and is a user defendant's stockyards, testified that Abbott's treatment of his firm as very sood and that the yards were now run a little differently than ley used to be in that, the superintendent would not permit stock to b^ ut into the yards unless cars were already on hand fcr shipment of le stock; that some shippers formerly used the yards as feeding pens. privilege now denied them. He stated that in so far as his knowledge ent no discrimination was now practiced as between shippers. Walter Boggs, a representative of the Bureau of Animal Industry of le United States Department of Agriculture and assigned to the super - sion of live stock and sanitation during 1918, testified that he visited he yards at Aurora tirst on March 20, 1918. and found them in very Â»ad condition as to feed, water and sanitation. The troughs were in le mud and in very unsanitary condition. Abbott was not in charge '. the yards when Mr. Boggs first visited them, but came about .Tune, 918. Mr. Boggs visited the yards at least once a month several times :ter that and noted marked improvement in the management and in le condition. On January 13. 1919, he reported "all pens in good con - ition and continuous cleaning being practiced." Mr. Haynes, station gent for the defendant at Aurora from June 1918, to February, 1920. estified that he had had no complaints from shippers as to the condition f the yards under Mr. Abbott but that he had heard Hillis threaten Abbott with personal injury on one occasion. W. D. Woodruff, present gent, stated that he had made the yards somewhat of a study since teing assigned to the station and had had no complaints from shipoers s to service or as to conditions except that Hillis had complained of Abbott. He also overheard Hillis upbraid Abbott. In his opinion Hiliis was inclined to demand too many privileges. He found Abbott very in - ustrious about the yards, but insistent that all rules and regulations tiould be complied with. Abbott made a request for platform scales so hat grain might be weighed and these were furnished. Jark Abbott, in his own behalf, testified that lie had been manager </seg>
            <seg id="p064">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 137 of the Aurora yards for two years, going to that point from the Burn - ham yards near Lincoln, where he was night foreman for several years. He admitted that at the time complained of corn was shipped irom the Burnham yards to Aurora that was "bin-fired." He supplied this corn to shippers until complaint was made, when he took it up with the general superintendent of stockyards and was instructed to discon - tinue its use. As to the weights, he stated that it had been the prac - tice to put corn in two bushel sacks and sell it by the bushel without weighing, but that after Hillis &amp; Bird registered complaints platform .scales were secured and that all corn was now weighed out to shippers. Abbott declared that Hillis demanded special privileges because of being a large shipper and insisted that he was entitled for that reason to special consideration. He called attention to the fact that the local tariff pro - vides for an extra charge of twenty-five cents per bushel for the second ieeding of corn and that under that tariff he had no other recourse than to assess the charge. In the opinion of the Commission the complaint in this case arises very largely out of friotion between two rather positive personalities, viz: that of Mr. Hillis and that of Mr. Abbott. The evidence is quite conclusive that under Mr. Abbott's management the condition of the yards has been greatly improved and that his management Is efficient. He manifest a desire to treat all shippers alike. It seems very likely lie is unnecessarily vigorous at times in the use of emphatic language and i.^ somewhat lacking in diplomacy. However, the record does not dis - close any intent on his part to defraud or mistreat shippers. Only ( ne instance of a poor grade of corn having been furnished is cited and it is shown that this was corrected as soon as complaint was made. The same is true with respect to weighing the grain. We are of the opinion, therefore, that no order in this case is necessary and that the complaint should be dismissed.

Also, they contended that the yards, being located near the end of the switch serving the present yards, did not leave storage room for cars sufficient to load more than two cars at one time without the aid of- a switch engine, which is not provided at this point. It also developed that the capacity of the present yards was entirely ample to take care of the normal business tributary from the surrounding territory and small village of Irvington, were it not for the fact that a sheep feeding plant located at or near the yards in question carries on a sheep feeding business, which during some months of the year increases the number of tars very materially. â¢ On examination, the Commission finds that the present yards are located near the end of the track serving them, leaving only room suffi - r'ent to load two cars. The plaintiffs, desire the track to be extended S-) that several cars may be stored nearer the leading chute, contending that they can be "pinched"' back to the chute for loading purposes We also find that It would require (1) an expense out of reason to extend said track, and (2) that it would place the track across a main (â¢(ingested traveled highway and create a hazard to life and property. The Commission is of the opinion that the present yarding facilities are quite ample to take care of the business tributary; that the facilities t Â»f loading and unloading sheep should be somewhat improved by ex - tending a run-way two car lengths north from the present yards, con- structing a double-deck loading chute at the north end of said run-way, which location would provide additional space for storing cars adja - cent to chute, and also giving relief asked for by the shipper.

OPINION AND FINDING Cock, Commissioner: The complainants contend that they are entitled to better shipping and depot accommodations at the village of Raeville, Boone county, Ni'bi aska. The village of Raeville is situated on defendant's branch line run - ning from Scribner to Oakdale, Nebraska, surrounded by a very produc - tive and well settled country, having within its territory well improved farms, suitable for the production of grain and live stock. The village of Raeville has about one hundred inhabitants, two stores, bank, elevator, a", i other industries. It is served by the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - way company's tracks, with a siding about seven hundred feet long, at which all trains stop for freight and passengers. The company pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p069">142 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL, REPORT vvies a box car (or station purposes ; also a caretaker who looks after '.he interests of the railway without authority to sell tickets or to bill freight, this being done by phone thru agents at nearby towns on de - fondant's lines. Complainants ask that the defendant railway company build and maintain a permanent railway station and stockyards and pro - vide a station agent for the transaction of business offered to said defendant at this point. The Commission after serving due notice to all concerned, set the natter down for hearing, which was had at the offices of the Commis - sion at Lincoln, Nebraska, April 15, 1921. The complainants were well represented by the business and stock men of Raeville and community; tlio company by its attorney and division officers. The evidence discovered that about five years ago defendant com- I any built a seven hundred foot siding at a point now Raeville, and that prior to that time the entire business of the surrounding territory in question was taken care of by it at its stations of Petersburg and Eligin, &lt;me 3.3 miles south, and the other 6.6 miles north on defendant's line. This act of the defendanl served to create the demand for a depot and shipping facilities asked for by complainants. The territory tributary '.o Raeville siding is limited, being confined to a few miles immediately around the village. The Commission recognizes that the distance be - tween the stations of Petersburg and Elgin, 9.9 miles, means that the intermediate territory surrounding Raeville would not be far from station facilities on the defendant's line without siding located at Raeville Since a siding is maintained at Raeville by defendant company and com - munity interests have centered there, it is reasonable to anticipate a substantial shipment of grain and live stock from this point. The rec - ords for the year 1920 show that ninety-nine cars were handled from the siding at Raeville and we are convinced by the evidence that this would be increased by seventy-five cars had the people facilities for loading their live stock at this point. This would forecast a business of approximately two hundred cars per year. We are convinced that the saving of time and convenience to defendant's patrons world justify the small expense required by this order. A farmer's live stock shipping association at Raeville ships each year from this neighborhood about seventy-five cars of live stock. This stock could be handled much more conveniently and with less shrinkage by providing loading chutes and yards at this point. It seems quite reasonable to this Coommission that the live stcck shippers should enjoy the advantage of shipping from this siding with as much freedom as the grain shippers who are pro - vided with elevator loading facilities. The defendant company contends that it does not own land ad - joining its right-of-way and adjacent to its side tracks sufficient to ac - commodate stockyards. The citizens of Raeville have procured a tract </seg>
            <seg id="p070">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 143 of about one acre of land adjoining the right-of-way in question, located at a point suitable for stockyards facilities (designated in the record as "owned by village of Raeville") and are offering this land, together wltn a roadway to it, free to the defendant company for the purpose of main - taining yards thereon. The Commission would not entertain the ad - visability of requiring defendant company to erect permanent depot facilities at the village of Raeville for the reason that the volume of business would not, under the circumstances, justify the continued ex - pense of maintenance. It would seem just and reasonable, however, for n if defendant company to build and maintain a two pen and loading chute stockyards on its siding at Raeville, to be located on defendant company's right-of-way and en land provided by the people of the com - munity. The expense of building the same would not be beyond a rea - sonable outlay by said railway company for the accommodation of its tock shippers. The Commission has investigated as to the cost of lumber and hardware required for two thirty-two foot square pens, with a twelve foot run-way between, together with a loading chute, and finds it would not exceed $300 for such improvement. The testimony shows that it would net reach that sum. The level of the ground at the point where the yards would be located is about four feet above the rails of defendant's side track, which would make the expense of building and maintaining a chute much less than at the ordinary location. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - ii'ission that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company be and it is htreby ordered to build and maintain a two-pen stcckyards, together with a run-way and loading chute for purposes of loading live stock into cars upon the side track of defendant company at Raeville, Nebraska, with the following capacity: Two thirty-two foot square pens, with a twelve foot run-way between, connecting with a chute leading into cars located on the side track of defendant company, said yards to be built on the right-of-way of defendant and on land furnished by complainants, or at such other point along defendant's right-of-way in Raeville as defendant may deem advisable, the same to be completed and "in good working order on or before sixty days after the delivery to this Commission for defendant company of a good and sufficient title to said defendant of the tract of about one acre of land adjoining defendant's right-of-way (designated in the exhibits and in the evidence as "owned by village of Raeville"). together with a roadway leading to said tract of land.

It is alleged tha: the tracks and switches and the arrangement of defendant's yards make it necessary that each engine should be so manned in order to make op - trating conditions safe for the crew. It is further alleged that the defendant is a common carrier with a large number of tracks which are used in moving shipments of live stock, arriving over the various railroads reaching South Omaha, to the defendant's yards; that owing to the number of sidetracks, their proxim - ity to each other and the many curves existing in the tracks the yards of the defendant are more dangerous than the ordinary switching yards: that it is necessary that the switching crews should consist of five men. as prayed, in order that the crews may be fully protected and that a smaller number is insufficient for that purpose; that all of the carriers in Nebraska have a rule requiring that switch engines shall be manned urith a crew of five men; that it is a rule of defendant company, as w-ell as being provided in the contract, hereinafter mentioned, that all of its switch engines shall be so manned, except in cases of emergency, and that by reason of the exception the defendant is continually violating the rule under the pretext that there is an emergency when in fact no emergency exists. The prayer is that the defendant may be ordered to man each switch engine within the yard limits with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one foreman and not less than two helpers. </seg>
            <seg id="p072">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 145 In his oral statement to the Commission the complainant modified his request by stating that he would be satisfied to have the Commission em - body in its order the language of the contract existing between the de - fendant and the local lodge of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen represented by the complaint, providing as follows: "No crew will be compelled to start out or work with less than one foreman and two helpers, except in cases of emergency." The answer admits that the defendant is a common carrier and that it owns and operates stockyards in South Omaha, Nebraska, in connection with which it operates a switching terminal, serving all carriers doing business at said yards; that in conducting its switching terminal the defendant endeavors to have each switching crew consia'. at all times of one engineer, one fireman, one foreman and two helpers and that such has been its uniform practice without exception unless a second helper was unavailable. Its prayer is for a dismissal of th â &gt; complaint or a continuance of the cause until it shall be made to ap - pear thai defendant is willfully or habitually failing- to equip its switch - in? engines with full crews. The evidence shows that during the labor scarcity of the war period there was a considerable number of crews operating with iess than five men. There is no difference between the parties as to the necessity of having a crew of five men upon each engine; the only difference between them is as to whether or not the Commission shall make a general order concerning the subject. The complainant seeks to show that it is necessary for the Commission to make such a general order to prevent continual friction between the switchmen and the defendant. The defendant alleges that the subject is covered by the contract which the Commission is without power to set aside; that In any event not until willful or habitual violations are shown should the Commission interfere. The Commission is not bound by the contract. In the exercise of the police power affecting safety no contractual limitations are to be racog - rizetl. People v. Hawley, 3 Mich., 330; Boston Beer Co. v. Mass., 97 U. S., 25 Pierce Oil Co. v. City of Hope, 248 U. S., 498. The denfendant further contends that the Commission is without jurisdiction under chapter 257, laws of 1919, which provides as follows: "Section 1. Jurisdiction of sedvice, facilities and equipment. â The State Railway Commission shall have and exercise jurisdiction over the service, facilities and equipment of all railroads In this state and shall, upon due notice and hearing, render judgment, orders, and decrees as to the efficiency, sufficiency and safety of the service, facilities or equipment furnished; and if any service. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">146 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT facilities or equipment is found inadequate, insufficient or unsafe the State Railway Commission shall order such changes therein or additions thereto made as shall to the commission seem neces - sary to render the same sufficient, efficient and safe. "Section 2. iSame â &lt;to whom law applies â construction. â The provisions of this act shall apply not cnly to those having business relations with the common carrier, but also the general public. This act shall not be construed as a limitation upon the powers of the State Railway Commission which have heretofore been granted, but as supplemental thereto. It is further provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as giving the State Railv/ay Commission jurisdiction or control of the relations between the railway companies and their employees and employees' orders either contractual or otherwise. "Section. 3. Violationâ civil penalty. â Any railroad company shall be liable for any damage or injury that shall be cause.) or contributed to by a violation of the provisions of this act by such railroad company if an order has been made by the State Railway Commission under this act, and in such case such railroad company shall not be entitled to the defense of assumption or risk or con - tributory negligence." In our view the statute quoted does not affect the powers or juris- diction of the Commission in this case. Under the constitution the Coin missitn's powers include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers, unless limited by legislative action. The statute quoted does not broaden the power thus given, as regulation of service of necessity includes regulation of facilities and equipment. The last provision of section 2 of the statute is purely negative. It Js merely a limitation of the act by its own terms. It neither increases nor diminishes the power vested in the Commission by the constitution. The sole question, then, before the Commission is whether or not sufficient showing has been made of failure of the defendant company to operate its facilities with due regard to the safety of its emplovees One of the rules of the defendant requires an engineer to stop his engine at any time he thinks he is not properly protected or the switch- Iran has disappeared. The evidence shows that the rule is being loi - lowed. During the year 1919 and a porticn of 1920 it was very difficult to obtain men and crews oftentimes worked short-handed. In recent months, however, such has been the case only infrequently. In April, 2921, all crews worked full-handed, as also in the month of May. In June four crews worked short-handed; in July three; in August onÂ»; in September three. The day is divided into three shifts of eight hours each, there being usually fifteen crews during the twenty-four hours, or five at a time. The proportion of short-handed crews is thus very small. When a crew is worked short-handed it results, as shown by the undis - pated evidence, from the fact that some man who is due to report for duty does not present himself when the crew is made up. The evidence </seg>
            <seg id="p074">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 ia clear and is not disputed by the complainant that the defendant in using; every endeavor to operate only with full crews and . that when n has not so operated it has not been owing to any lack of foresight or diligence on the part of the defendant. The imperative necessity of delivering livestock promptly is due not only to the civil liability that would tall upon the defendant in ( ase of delay, which doubtless would be very serious, but also to heavy penalties provided for keeping stock on trains more than twenty-eight hours (or if released, thirty-six hours). Nevertheless the evidence justifies an order requiring defendant to operate all switch trains in its service with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one fore - man, and two helpers, save only in those instances where the use of a ,-ihort-handed crew is unavoidable. We so find.

            <seg id="p075">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 148 Nebraska, representing his district in the legislature, complained that a certain crossing over defendant's railroad at Edison, Nebraska, was unsafe and should be provided with a wig wag signal for the purpose cf appraising the public of approaching trains. The complainant in - sisted that the Commission hold a public hearing at Edison, giving the citizens of the village a chance to be heard. May 13, 1921, the Commission made a careful study of the c-men - tions surrounding said dangerous railroad crossing; also held a public Hearing, making a record of the testimony offered relative to the same. The public was represented by Mr. Franklin; the defendant railroad company by its general superintendent, engineer and attorney. The testimony developed a desire on the part of a major portion of the wit - nesses that a signal should be placed at the crossing on Main street in Euison where defendant's railroad tracks cross said street. The evi - dence did not substantially support the contention in that the witnesses could not establish a good reason for their belief that a signal was ab - solutely necessary at the crossing in question. The village of Edison comprises a community of about one hundred people, the village being located entirely south of defendant's tracks with the exception of the industrial buildings, the elevators, lumber yards, etc., which are sit - uated on the north side cf the tracks. The street crossing in question takes care of all the traffic of the village that has occasion to cross to the north side: also all travel coming into the village from the north. The evidence and exhibits clearly show that the view on Main street. both east and west, at defendant's railroad crossing is unobstructed ex - cept as to location of the depot, which is near the crossing. This ob - struction could be eliminated by moving the depot one block west to a location that would serve the village quite as well as its present loca - tion. This the defendant company offers to do at any time the village requests it so to do. It developed that there were eight through trains passing the crossing in question each day. The danger from these trains is apparently no greater, however, in the judgment of the Commission, than hundreds of other crossings in the state that present the same hazard at all times and are only made safe by the traveling public ob - serving care in approaching the same. The evidence placed the original cost of a wig-wag signal, such as desired for this location, at $1500, to which must be added the usual maintenance cost each year. The Commission in its consideration of the solution of this contention was not altogether adverse to granting . omplainant's request. Before its decision was reached additional de - velopments reached the Commission as to the serious need of an ex - pense of this magnitude at this point, the village board of Edison filinsr with the Commission a resolution, which is in the words and figure .-? as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p076">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 149 â¢RESOLUTION "WHEREAS it is deemed not necessary by the board of trustees of the village of Edison, Nebraska, that a signal or gong bell be installed at the railroad crossing on Main ave. just east of depot; "WHEREAS three-fourths of the members of said board of trustees have by vote disregarded the construction of a signal or bell at the crossing east of depot; "BE IT RESOLVED by the chairman and board of trustees of the village of Edison, Nebraska, that on this date of this resolution to withdraw from the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. for a signal or gong bell to be placed at crossing just east of said depot, whereas if same were to be installed it would be a nuisance. "Passed this 17th day of June, 1921. "(Signed) N. B. Carroll, Chairman "(Signed) H. L. Billesbach, Village Clerk. SEAL." The Commission recognizes the fact that signals placed at crossings when in good working order do announce the approach of trains and that 'hpre are many crossings within the state that a device of this kind would ia a measure announce to the traveler the possibility of danger, yet the (â¢pen condition surrounding the crossing under consideration leads us to believe that if the people using this crossing approached it with ord - inary care and thoughtfulness the danger of accidents would be elim - inated. We think, however, it advisable that the defendant railroad company set one additional whistling post to the east and west of its depct. requiring two full signal whistles before entering the village in l!ace of one. as now used.

OPINION AND FINDING COOK, Commissioner: On March 19, 1921, a petition was filed by S. J.

Pursuant to notice given, the interested parties appeared and after an extended conference was held, no testimony being taken, a stipu - lation waÂ« entered into by all parties, which stipulation is as follows: "IT IS STIPULATED by the Community Club of the city of Ox - ford and the mayor and council of the city of Oxford by their attor - ney, J.

The stipulation having been duly considered by the Commission and found reasonable, and serving the interests of all concerned, the same is approved. The defendant, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, has rebuilt and completed its crossings and has complied with the provisions of the stipulation and conference held.

OPINION AND FINDINO COOK, Commissioner The complainant in this action, Harry Ford, is a resident of Palls City, Richardson county, Nebraska, and chairman of the Nebraska Leg - islative Board of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen. The prayer of his complaint before this Commission seeks to require railroads "op - erating within Nebraska to equip all switch stands with standard switch lights in yards where switch engines are operated in the night time." After the investigation had proceeded for some time the complainant's attorney changed the prayer seeking an order as follows: "Equip all switch stands used at night, and within yard limits, with lights and to keep such lights burning on all switch stands within yard limits when used at night." The defendant railroad companies admit that they do operate switch engines in yards within the state where some of the switch stands are not equipped with standard switch lights; that there FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 432 </seg>
            <seg id="p079">152 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL. REPORT are locations wbere it is physically impossible to maintain switch stands or lights. It follows that the evidence to be considered in this case will be confined exclusively to the danger of such operations. Four witnesses testified for complainant. The records show that ihree of the witnesses were men active in railroad work in capacity of .switchman, conductor and yard foreman. The fourth witness, the com plainant, and an ex-railroad man, has for the last twelve years been in commercial life and not acquainted with modern railroad management. The testimony of these witnesses was very much alike as to their knowledge and as to the conditions in the different localities referred to. They all agreed that in the performance of their duties there wert dangerous conditions; that if they should stumble over a switch stand, or fall over the ends of the ties, or in any manner make a misstep, they would undoubtedly be injured. None of the witnesses had ever been hurt during the performance of their duties as switchman, nor could they recall any specific case, within their knowledge of men being hurt in the performance of their duties where switch lights would have made it otherwise. One witness, Mr. Shropshire, testified that he had stumbled over a switch stand at one time but did not experience any serious trouble from the fall. The witnesses were unanimous in stating that the rail - road companies maintain good lights on most of the switch Stands that are used continuously in the different yards; that they could not name any special location in the yards where lights should be placed. Wit - nesses were acquainted with the fact that safety committees were main - tained on the different roads to whom complaints could be made relative to dangerous conditions existing in yards. A careful analysis ol the testimony of the witnesses for the com - plainants did not develop a genuine need for a general order as con - templated in complainant's prayer. It is quite evident, however, that there may be a demand for an extra light occasionally where switch stands are now being used in places they were previously not used. The testimony of E. Flynn, general superintendent of the Burling - ton, as to the existence of a safety committee, testified that such com - mittees were maintained by his road on the different divisions; that cards were supplied to employees so that they could report any im - provements in working conditions that they desired to have corrected. His testimony showed very clearly that the railroad officials were anxious to have knowledge of this nature and were willing and able to put into effect any improvement that would expedite the work and bring about safer conditions for their employees and that they desired to place lights on all stands at any point on their line where they were needed. Since the hearing took place on this action the writer has examined several railroad yards and studied the switch light conditions, the gen - eral location of switch stands, and finds that all principal switch stands </seg>
            <seg id="p080">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 153 are well lighted and from observation of switching operations at nighi time he is convinced that with ordinary care and forethought (that should be ever present with the active man), together with a good light in the hands of the operator, there should be no greater hazard than found in the same work during the daylight hours. Evidence of J. G. Bloom, division engineer of the Rock Island, place* the cost of maintaining switch lights per year on defendant's line at $32.00. A sweeping general order as sought by the complainant would, in the judgment ol the Commission, create an unreasonable and unjust added -expense for the carriers and as the records of this case are clear and convincing that the carriers are well within the law governing the placing of lights on switch stands, also that the officers of said railway lines recognize the importance of placing lights where conditions demand and have expressed their willingness to follow the advice of safety com - mittees in so doing, the Commission does not feel that a general order would be necessary under the existing circumstances and evidence. An order of the Commission denying a general order seems, from all ngles of the evidence, to be entirely just, however there might be con- iTete cases where the safety committee and the officers of the carriers raillMTt agree. In such instances application may be made to tfee Com - mission for relief. The Commission will net discuss the clearance feature injected into this case. An order as suggested relative to clearance would be clearly :.n abuse of power as it would cause the reconstruction of every yard and terminal within the state. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the complaint of Harry Ford et al against the different railroads operating in Nebraska be and it is hereby dismissed.

Harsh and eighteen other .esidents of the vicinity of Lowell and Newark. It shows that they are engaged in farming, stock raising and feeding of live stock. Some of &gt;hem live in the vicinity of the station of Lowell and the rest in the vicinity of the station of Newark. These are two shipping points on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company's line which runs from Kearney to Hastings, Nebraska. The two towns named are the cus - tomary shipping places of all the complainants. The complainants allege that the usual markets for their shipments of live stock are South Omaha, St. Joseph and Kansas City; that much i f the time the markets of South Omaha are over-supplied with live stock while the markets of St. Joseph and Kansas City are under-supplied with live stock and that for other reasons the markets of St. Joseph and Kansas City are better than the market at South Omaha: that by rea - scn of defendant's present schedule on the line serving the stations named live stock shipments are hauled by freight train to Hastings, whence the cars are sent to Lincoln, Nebraska, where, in case of ship - ments to St. Joseph and Kansas City, Missouri, they must be unloaded nnd fed; that the only freight train through the stations named leaves Lpwelt about 11:40 o'clock a. m. and Newark about noon of each week day, which, by reason of the train schedules in force, brings live stock into Lincoln toe late for direct shipment to St. Joseph or Kansas City, necessitating the unloading and feeding above mentioned: that prior to the year 1918 and during a part of that year the defendant was requested by shippers to attach cars loaded with live stock to the passenger train which runs eastward through Newark and Lowell during the forenoon in time to make connection at Hastings with the through live stock trains, thus enabling shippers to reach the markets of St. Joseph and Kansas City without unloading at Lincoln; that by reason of the unloading at Lincoln and the shrinkage due thereto, and by reason o r ' the delay, a financial loss of fifty dollars per car is caused to the shipper, or ship - ment tc South Omaha is made necessary and a smaller price is realized: that the morning passenger train eastward through Lowell and Newark is composed of an engine, n baggage car and two coaches; that the- </seg>

Statistics of bipmeutB from the respective stations are given In tabular form, show - ng a substantial movement of stock intrastate from taest' Stations dUTinjJ ach of the years 1918, 1919 and 1920, and a very small interstate move - ent, during the Same period, therefrom; the number of cars shipped nterstate from Loweii during the three years being eighteen and thf umber of cars shipped interstate from Newark during the three years eing eleven. The prayer is for an order requiring the carrier to carry shipments of live stocK eastward on the morning train to Hastings; also to carry t-hipments westward in connection with the afternoon passenger train, 8S it is alleged there is a considerable movement of stock cattle from omaha to the stations named. The passenger trains are strictly intra - state trains, moving between Kearney and Hastings. While the ftmOUnt Of Stock handled has been small, it is probable there would be some in - crease in the movement if the services prayed for were granted. The Company answered, admitting the formal allegations concern - ing its common carrier character and concerning the schedule and equip - ment of the passenger train. It admits that at times the market at SOUth Omaha is OVei'-SUPPlied and alleges that at Limes all of Ihe markets named are over-supplieG. It admits the ntimbei" Of Cars Ol live Stock shipped as alleged by complainants. It alleges that the Stations or LOWell and Xewark receive the same treatment as all other trwns in Nebraska which are desirOUS Of Shipping tO St. Joseph and Kansas City; that it is impracticable and impossible to transport live StOCk tO St. Joseph and Kansas City markets from different parts of Ne - braska which require a cross-over at Lincoln, without feeding at that point, in order to comply with the statutory requirements, both State 1'nd federal; that it has ceased the practice of carrying live stock in connection With passenger trains and that for the safety and comfort of the public it is necessary that the two services be Kp-pt Separate and d'stinct. Pour inquiries present themselves under tile COmplililU. 1. Does the volume Of traffic justify an order requiring the service prayed for? As only eighteen cars moved to interstate markets from Lowell during the three years and only eleven from Newark, Or a total Of tV; enty-nine, cr an average of less than five cars per year from each town, during the period, it Seems that the Commission would hardly be justified In making an order as prayed for; although, as Suggested in the plead - ings, and as shown in the evidence, the movement would probably bf </seg>
            <seg id="p084">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 157 jUinewhat larger if the train schedules were rearranged or stock ship - ments were allowed to be made in connection with passenger trains. 2. Has the State Railway Commission jurisdiction to make an order concerning the handling of ears in purely interstate traffic? This question seems to have not been passed upon by the courts. There is no reference in the briefs to authorities On the Subject and our own investigation has not revealed any. It IS ObViOUS that it" the order prayed for were entered it would not be an additional burden upon interstate commerce. In fact, it would lessen the burdens upon it. Therefore, it cannot be said that it would Y'Ork an interference with, interstate commerce within the meaning of the Federal constitutional provision and statutes. Viewed from the state's position, however, would the Commission be justified in making ilP Order based purely upon the necessities of interstate traffic? Under our view the powers of the Commission relate solely to control of intra - state traffic and do not involve a consideration of purely interstate traffic. TherelOP-, if an order of this Comission were based solely upon the nec - essities of interstate traffic it would lack a proper foundation. This does not govern that part of the complaint directed at the service west from Hastings, which relates to the movement ot" stock cattle from Omaha to i lie stations mentioned, but that part of the traffic is also very small :is shown by the evidence and probably would not be greatly increased by I he granting of the prayer of the complaint. 3. H&amp;S the Commission jurisdiction to require the carriage of cars of live stock in connection with passenger trains, there being already reasonably adequate freight service provided? It must be conceded that the freight service offered by the de - f. ndant is reasonably adequate and that the additional service rendered by the passenger train, it' the relief prayed for were granted, would be nil added service, which, while very convenient for the shippers would entail some added difficulties in transportation by the carrier and WOUld CMAte intonvenienoe and discomfort to the passengers carried., Exper - ieiu !â  has proven the desirability of carriage of passengers upon trains entirely separate and distinct from those used in the carriage of freight. This is so apparent as to need no discussion. A few Of the ObviOUS advantages Of tile division Of traffic may, however, be mentioned. PaB - .^enger trains are able to maintain their schedules "with much greater regularity than freight trains. This is due to the fact that they are de - tained at stations only a short time; that in case of delay tney are able to make up lost time more readily because as a rule they are much lighter and the motive power employed for them is not so often, used to capa - city as in freight service.

We think that the carrier is fully justified in maintaining a separate service so far as it is possible. (X course where the traffic is very light it is some- Umes necessary to employ mixed trains. That is a matter which must very largely be left to the discretion Of the carrier and that discretion win not be interfered with except in case of palpable abuse. The courts recognize the propriety and in fact the necessity ot division of traffic. Under the Nebraska statutes certain provisions (section 59S5, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913) are made with regard to gasoline motor oars and gasoline propelled trains upon which passengers are transported. Under section 5986. Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, it is provided that the State Railway Commission shall have power to release a rail - way company from SUCh provisions on new reads where steam passenger trains have not been regularly run Until SUCh time as business will war - rant better service, also on parts or roads where at least One Steam passenger train is run, which makes regular stops at least six days in Ihe week. The latter section contains this proviso: "Provided, mixed freight and passenger trains shall not be COB sidered passenger trains." While the PI'OVisiCn does not relate directly to the present case. yet it is a Strong indication that the legislature intended that there snouid be, as far as possible, a complete separation of the two services If requirements were to be made that carriers should carry -;ars Of live StOCk OH passenger trains it is probable that no greater speed than that provided for life StOCk Shipments under section 6918. Revised Statutes rf Nebraska for 1913, would be required. This would be entirely too k.ow a movement for regular passenger service SO that Unless the fur - ther requirement be made that notwithstanding shipments of live Stock are made in Connection with passenger trains they should maintain their regular schedules, we Should be lowering the pasesnger schedule by making the requirement. We think that this would be UujUSt tO the traveling public and it would also doubtless result in increased operat ing diffCUltieS 10 the carrier as the schedule of the passenger trains wou'.d be lower on one part Of the run than on other parts of the run. It might also create difficulty in enforcing the live Stock Caretakers law. Session Laws, 1921, Chapter 176. In Kuenzli et al v. C. M. &amp; St. P. R. R. Co.. 12 Wis. R. R. Com Re - ports, 690, it was sought to compel the railroad company to carry cans of milk on a passenger train. The commission used the following language: (693) "Prom a careful examinaticn of the testimony and Of the report Of our engineer we are of the opinion that the action of the com - pany in refusing to carry milk on No. 34. the later train, is justified </seg>
            <seg id="p086">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 in view of the surrounding circumstances. A passenger train i.s operated primarily to transport passengers, and that part of its business should be given first, consideration. If two trains are operated within a period which can be regarded as reasonable for the handling of milk, it is in the interest of the traveling public that the train which is most heavily patronized by passengers should not be burdened with the delays necessarily occasioned by loading milk." â t. Would the granting of the prayer of the complaint cause discrim- ination Jt is plain that these shipping live stock in connection with pas - senger trains would have an advantage over other shippers that were â¢iot given the same privilege. Of course, tariffs might be filed that \. ouid require such service, but unless all shippers were accorded the iime treatment the carrier would immediately be chargeable with un - lawful discrimination. The value of service is oftentimes directly de - pendent upon the time consumed in its rendition and this is especially true with such a commodity as live stock which depreciated greatly in value with delay. If the shippers from the two stations named were tilis expedited service we should doubtless be submerged with com - plaints :rom shippers all ever the state demanding similar service and unless eranted there would be discrimination. In Logan v. Central R. Co. et ;il, P. V. R. 1916A, 345, the complain - ant asked ;or shipment of milk upon a certain passenger train. The -vllabus of the case succinctly states the conclusion at which we have arrived in this case. "1. A milk company paying ;i freight rate for freight service ia not entitled to have its shipments of milk transported in baggage cars attached to passenger trains, nor to receive express service at freight rates, simply because such service is better suited to the needs rf its business." ' We tind that the Commission is without jurisdiction to enter an order as to stock moving eastward; that the volume of stock moving WMtW&amp;fd does not justify any modification of the schedules; that the order could not be granted v/ithout improperly burdening the passenger service; and that unlawful discrimination would be caused If h. were si-anted.

For respondent â P. M. Wheeler, attorney. For Interveners â Village of Ralston, J. A. Ratchford. attorney. Village of Papillion, H. A. Collins, Attorney. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: Complainant herein operates an electric interurban railway, extend - ing from 24th and N streets, South Omaha, through the unincorporated village of Homestead and the incorporated town of Ralston, and into tht - incorpcrated town of Papillion. It owns 7.9 miles of trackage and leases additional trackage or trackage rights. It has been operating: an inter - urban system since August, 1913, and "has a very considerable invest - ment in electric railway properties in addition to other public service properties owned by it. Respondent operates a gasoline motor bus line between 24th ;im! N streets, Omaha, and Ralston, Nebraska, a distance of approximately live miles. He has been in business since May. 1921. Complainant did operate three electric cars daily, with a seating tapacity cf approximately fifty each. In August last, because of poor patronage the Commission allowed a reduction in schedules and cer - tain changes in routing, under which complainant has continued to operate with two cars, one of which regularly runs between North Omaha and Ptipillion, Nebraska, on the schedule requiring two hours round trip, and the other between Ralston, Nebraska, and South Omaha, Re - spondent began operation with one automobile bus and in Aufrust added another bus, which latter car supplements in heavy traffic movement and is available for irrepular service in the "valley" traffic periods of the day. </seg>
            <seg id="p088">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 161 Complainant's petition alleges that it has adequately served the territory through which it runs and that in spite of diversity and lack if encouraging earnings it has coniinued ic serve the territory. It al - leges that respondent had begun operation or another carrier system. following a route identical with part of the route of complainant, with cne terminus identical and its other terminus at a midway station ol complainant, and that it operates on approximately the sume schedule. It is alleged that this operation is confined to the territory where thtÂ» population is most abundant and leaves to the exclusive use of complain - ant that portion of its whole route where it never had been able to operate successfully from the revenues there received. Other allegations were made by complainant as to practices of respondent inimical to the safety of its own passengers and to the performance of its duty. The petition prays that respondent be required: lal To operate on a regular route between designated termini and on a fixed schedule which shall iilternate in time with the schedule of complainant. ibi To desist from blocking the track of complainant with motor busses at loading and unloading points and to desist further from run - ring directly ahead of the electric cars on the track, thereby prevent - ing said electric cars from operating freely upon schedule. I ci To keep records and tc make reports to the Commission as is required of other common carriers. At the time of the hearing the petition was amplifliea and amended by the proposal of certain rules which the Comission was asked to im - jose upon respondent, these being in chief (1) close adherence to pub - lished schedules, (2i established fares, (3&gt; prchibition of passengers rMr in^ outside vehicle. (4) reports of all accidents and interruption of serv - ice. (oÂ» limitation of loads to seating capacity, (6) standby equipment to insure regularity of service, and (7! assurances ol continued operation in the future. Respondent, in answer, r.dmitted it was a common carrier; insisted that the difficulties cf complainant were due to poor service rendered â¢md to extravagant operating expenses and that it could readily show profits il proper economies were practiced; denied that its schedules were based on complainant's time; denied that it had in any manner interfered with the operation of complainant's cars; stated that it was ready to make such reports as might be required by the Commission; and praye.ri for an order approving its schedules as now published, requiring complain - ant to refrain from further molestation of operation of its busses and asking for instructions as to the nature of the reports to the Commis - sion to be made by it. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">162 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The village of Ralston intervened at the time of the hearing and asked that its citizens might have common carrier service by the parties to this suit in an adequate manner and without duplication of schedules. The village of Papillion asked that the Commission enter such order as would insure continuation or proper transportation between Papillion and Omaha in the interest oi' the convenience of the citizens of that municipality. Before the date of hearing, complainant amplified its petition by M additional prayer, asking that the Commission "make anil enter a general order that no person, co-partnership or corporation other than a municipal corporation shall, after the taking effect of said order, engage in business as a common carrier of passengers between points within the state of Nebraska and not within the same city c r village where there is already in opeiation a public utility engaged in similar service without first securing from the Nebraska State Railway Commission a declaration after a public hearing of all parties interested that public convenience and necessity require such second public utility. " Regarding this additional prayer it was agreed of record that it was not intended to apply in the instant case. The Commission directeil that the matters involved in this additional prayer .should be briefed as to jurisdiction and policies separately from the. matters complained of in the original petition in order that it might not complicate the issues therein. The testimony showed that complainant has only two cars in its equipment since a disastrous fire, which destroyed a car barn and four cars. These remaining cars are not particularly modern but are In operating: condition. Its general schedule up until August, 1921, was hourly service between Ralston and Omaha, with more frequent service by use of "trippers" &lt;!urins peak loads. It had two hour service be - tween Ralston and Papillion. With the permission of the Commission it now makes sixteen trips per day between Ralston and Omaha where it formerly made twenty-six. It gives two hour service during the "valley" traffic. Were it not that the company's traffic is very light and that even this amount of service is not beins furnished at a profit to the company it would be necessary to find that the amount of its serv - ice is entirely inadequate. Respondent has two automobile trucks with omnibus brdies. tin* oue seating twenty-two passengers and the other eighteen. The larger car has cross-seats nnd the smaller one seats running lengthwise. En - trance is by a door near the front and exit the same. Each car is equipped with an emergency lear dour. Each has interior lights. Respondent operates hourly between Ralston and Omaha, with some extra tripper Ervice between Ralston and Omaha and even more extensive additional rvice in peak loads between Homestead and Omaha. By Omaha is </seg>
            <seg id="p090">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 163 meant 24th and N streets in what w;is formerly South Omaha. Running time of complainant between Ralston and Omaha is twenty-two minutes. Schedules are built on thirty minute headway so that even in peak tral - fie there should be no difficulty in maintaining the schedule. The run - ning time of the busses is twenty-five minutes between Ralston and Omaha and its schedules are built on thirty minute headway. The second bus appears, from a study of respondent's schedule, to be used almost entirely as standby equipment in the "valley" load periods of the day and for tripper service during the peak demand. The complainant presented testimony, supported by copies of re - ports made from day 10 day by its employes, of practices on the part of respondent, the result of which was merely to interfere with the opera - lion, of complainant's cars. Categorical denials were made by respondent as to these allegations. Two members of the Commission were, how - cver, on one occasion eyewitnesses to a considerable interference by respondent in the way of operating its busses on the track of complain - ant with the body so far overhanging the track us to make it impossible lor complainant's cars to pass. This interference by respondent may have been merely to irritate complainant, or it may have been for the purpose of keeping complainant always in the rear on the competitive trips in order to get first chance at waiting passengers. Whatever the motive, the practice is indefensible. The complainant had been granted ;i franchise by the state to locate its roadbed as it is and deliberate inter - ference with its serving the public and securing the maximum use from its own property ought not to be tolerated. Even more important than this is the safety of passengers upon respondent's' busses. There would possibly be no danger so long as the heavy electric car was properly functioning but if brakes failed to work disaster might occur to those riding in the more or less fragile omnibus. Such rules will be promul - gated in this order as are deemed necessary to the safety cf those ridine in the busses. We do not know that complainant, who does not patronize the busses, cau be heard to complain against operating conditions of the bus lines, so lens as complainant is not affected. The intervening rep - resentatives of the public did not make a point of dangers in the operat - ing practices of the bus company. The Commission will, therefore, dis - regard the amendment to petitioner's complaint, but will on its own motion provide such rules as will in its judgment insure reasonable protection to the bus-riding public. In its answer respondent set forth the schedule followed by it in the operation of the busses in regular service. Complainant submitted as evidence a three-day check of the departing time of respondent's busses at each terminus, which check showed that no particular care was followed by respondent in keeping schedules but a constant tendency to </seg>
            <seg id="p091">164 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT diverge from the published schedule in the direction of the identical de - jiarting time of complainant's cars. The accuracy of this exhibit was (hallenged by witness lor lespondent. who. however, offered no other offsetting proof than mere denial. Witness for complainant testified that (here is nrt enough busi - ness to make profitable lhe present amount of service under any schedule arrangement. Respondent says he is now making money, but if the peti - tion of complainant regarding the schedules is approved by the Com - mission and respondent is required to depart from each termini half way between the present departing periods of complainant, respondent Will be so deprived of revenue during peak load demands as to be unable to continue operation. The evidence warrants the conclusion that ap - proximately two-thirds of the traffic is now handled by complainant and une-third by respondent. In brief, complainant urges that the Commission has the entire power to regulate these competing utilities where constitutional rights are not invaded by the nxtent of the regulation and where it does not cross the plain mandate Of the legislature. It is urged that the Com - mission actually has the power of certificate of convenience and neces - sity from the constitutional provision creating it, but that such poWi r cannot reach respondent who is already in business. Complainant sp^ri- fleully denies that it is attempting to eliminate res] undent petitcr. 'Respondent admits that the Commission has wide powers over it as a common carrier, but argues to these conclusions (ai that schedules which would deprive respondent of a portion of the business it now has we uld be an unwarranted invasion of property rights; lb; that to re - quire respondent to take the less favorable schedn' â  from a financial point of view would be discrimination and void: &lt;c &gt; that complainant cannot be heard to lift its voice in the interest of the public so long as the public is served with regular transportation at reasonable rates: id) 1hat the complainant's motives are to eliminate respondent from competition; and (e) that any rules or regulations applied to respondent and withheld treat complainant would institute class legislation and would be unconstitutional and discriminatory. li the constitutional amendment creating the Commission, and the present condition of the statutes, leave vested in this Commission the power to regulate competition in the interest of the general public by requiring at its option a certificate of convenience and necessity, it is prrbable that the fact that this respondent is already engaged in business does not put him rutside the scope of that restriction. But the question of that power of the Commission is only raised in the additional prayer, and will be briefed separately by the parties and will be considered in a supplemental finding. </seg>

It is not necessary at this time to say whether this Commission i as been vested with any such police power, for the public interest, in our opinion, neither requires that he cease cperations or be seriously embarrassed financially by regulations. Respondent contend.-- that complainant cannot raise the question at public interest, and that its object is to eliminate respondent as a competitor. This latter accusation may easily be true, although it is not shown in. either pleadings or testimony. The public is. however, ai tively party to the case through the petitions of intervention from the officials of Ralston and Papillion. The Commission would not be precluded in any event from considering the general welfare in this legislative matter. Here are two common carriers before the Commission, differing in their contentions as to the jurisdiction cf the Commission only in the matter of its extent. During much of the day they operate upon approxim - ately the same schedules, between the same points and along the same route. Respondent contends that even though it is found that public interest requires changes in schedules they cannot be applied to respond - ent alcne, because such a finding would be discriminatory, would result disastrously to his business, and would be class legislation. It is con - tended that action by the Commission that did not apply to each party to this case would be unduly discriminatory because improper classifi - cation. On authority we find that a classification which distinguishes lietween bus common carriers and electric train cemjnon carriers is not improper. </seg>

Complainant said it may not be able to continue in business under this competition over the most profitable part of its route. Defendant testified that he did not believe he could operate except at a loss if re - quired to alternate with complainant if present schedules of the latter are approved. It appears probable that both are right. Respondent. City of Ralston, alleges the fact to be that the present arrangement adds nothing to the service of the town compared to what it was before bus lines were established, that future service to the citizens of the town is in grave danger, and that both these objections would be relieved by a rearrangement of schedules. The village of Papillion prays for relief from any danger of similar competition to that existing at Ralston. Witnesses from Homestead testified that service had been improved by the addition of bus service and they considered it almost adequate. We find that the interest of the public served by complainant and defendant requires a rearrangement of schedules to prevent such duplica - tion of trips. To this end schedules of both parties will be changed the more changes being made in the schdules of respondent as the last - comer. The present schedules of both parties indicate that the heavy traffic periods are of long enough duration to enable them to handle each a part, although it is possible neither may do so profitably. Other testimony bears out the conclusion. It is recognized that schedule mak - ing is complex and that it may be necessary for the parties to ask modi - fication of the appended schedules on account of practical difficulties that may develop in some instances. If the public is to be best served the largest possible service must be rendered when traffic is most dense. The schedules appended will so provide. Respondent will be required to keep simple but compre - hensive books of account which will be outlined by the accounting de - partment of the Commission. From his testimony respondent is almost execution-proof. He owns an equity in each bus, but that equity is doubtless small owing to declining prices of such vehicles since these of respondent were pur - chased, and to rapid depreciation not specifically provided against as yet by respondent. He carries insurance to protect his passengers, but the terms of the policies do not appear in the record. We find that a liability insurance policy shall be carried on each vehicle operated by respondent for the sole protection of passengers, and that these policies shal be submitted to the Commission for approval not later than December 10, 1921. Respondent's rates will be approved as asked in its answpr and cross-petition. </seg>

Oconto Telephone Company, Defendant. Appearances: For Complainants,â F. J. Trindle; For defendant â H. C. Hewitt, attorney; OPINION AND ORDER. Taylor, Chairman: This complaint was brought originally by members or the Tucker - ville Telephone company, which operates farm lines out of Oconto, these lines being switched at Oconto by the Oconto Telephone company. Later other complaints were received from residents of Oconto who receive telephone service direct from the Oconto Telephone company. Finding it impossible to adjust the matter by correspondence and through in - formal action, the complaints were set down for hearing at Oconto and a full investigation had on January 5, 1921. Prior to that date the Com - mission's engineering department, through its representative Mr. R. C. McClain, made a service study at Oconto. The Oconto Telephone company owns a switchboard and serves seventy subscribers within the village limits of Oconto. It performs switching service for 160 farmers who maintain lines to the village limits. Defendant company owns no farm lines. This complaint goes to the char - acter of the service furnished by the Oconto Telephone company. It is alleged that the condition of the central office equipment is such that it is and has been impossible to secure adequate service. At the hearing a large number of witnesses were summoned by complainant, the testimony being very similar and largely to the effect that it is im - possible to signal the central operator in the usual manner by turning the crank on the subscriber's instrument. There was also a general complaint that having once obtained a connection through the central office it was very difficult to put through second and third calls be - cause of the failure of the operator to make the disconnection. There was some testimony with reference to cross-talk and to the failure of the company to repair subscribers' instruments in town. The burden of the complaint, however, -was as to the inability to signal central. Mr. McLain of the Commission's engineering department, in his report, which was made a part of this record, described the condition of de - fendant's property, as follows: "The Oonto Telephone company's office equipment is old and in very poor repair. The cord circuits are in especially poor condition </seg>
            <seg id="p099">172 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT and the ringing equipment is not strong- enough to ring on the farm lines. The lines of the Oconto Telephone company are in poor con - dition and in need of repairs. Also most ol the telephones I visited were found in poor condition. I'The Oconto Telephone company has only cne paid operator, who works from 7 a. m. until 10 p. m., except Sunday, when the office is closed, from 10 a. m. until 4 p. m. The Oconto Telephone company has no linemen and no testing apparatus of any kind." Defendant, through its secretary Mr. Bridges, and through its line - man Mr. Funkner, objected to the statement that it has no lineman and no testing apparatus of any kind, contending that the employment of a permanent lineman is unnecessary because of the small number cl telephones in Oconto and that when a lineman is secured he furnishes a testing outfit, which is all that is needed Her the purpose of the service. It was also asserted that the cord circuits complained of by Mr. McLain had been replaced by new ones following his investiga - tion. It was admitted by both Mr. Bridges and Mr. Funkner that the switchboard is in poor condition and that it should be replaced if for no other reason than that it is now being operated almost to the full limit of its capacity. According tc the testimony of Mr. Funkner, there is but one "clear out drop" on the board, which makes it impossible for tne subscriber, by turning the crank at the instrument on completing a conversation, to signal the operator to make the disconnection. The point made by Mr. Bridges that subscribers do not follow instructions to "ring off" is, therefore, of no force since the equipment makes such action on the part of the subscriber unnecessary and futile. It wis alleged by Mr. Bridges that the operator who was employed for eighteen months prior to January 1 was incompetent and inefficient and largely lesponsible for most of the poor service conditions. A change in opera - tors was made on that date but this hearing was held on January 5 sn. that the time had been-too short to demonstrate whether more cfficien operation would improve conditions. It is clear to the Ccmmision that the service lurnished by defending cannot be brought up to a proper standard until the central office equip - ment has been very greatly improved. In fact, it is probable that a new switchboard should be installed. At the time of its installation all of the central office equipment should be overhauled. The wiring, accord - ing to the record, is defective and does not insure perfect communica - tion. The distribution system of defendant in the town is not in good condition and should be overhauled. Many of the wires are slack so that during periods of high. wind they come in contact with each oi*ier, thus causing cross-talk and short circuits. This condition should be remedie 1. The criticism of subscribers that a lineman is not kop; on duty constantly is not justified. A company with only seventy subscribers cannot employ a lineman permanently for tlu- very simple reason that </seg>
            <seg id="p100">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 173 the total gross revenue would be absorbed by such an expenditure, leaving nothing to pay operators, taxes, and other operating expenses. Defendant's arrangement with a neighboring telephone company for the use of a portion of the spare time of its lineman is a sensible solution of the maintenance problem. After the property is put in good repair, a weekly visit of this lineman, who is a competent man, should be suffi - cient to keep the plant in serviceable condition. In the event of a complete overhauling of defendant's equipment, however, a high standard of service will not necessarily be insured to those served by the farm lines. It appears altogether probable that much Of the complaint, as to service on the farm system is due to the condition of the country lines, a mater entirely beyond the control of defendant. Failure of the farmers to maintain their lines results just as certainly in their inability to get the central operator as does some defect in the central office. So long, too, as farm subscribers per - sist in taking down their receivers every time a call is put over the line, just so long will the operator experience difficulty in ringing sig - nals direct. Some of the farm lines serve over twenty patrons. Service under such a condition is at the very best difficult, if not impossible, It is rendered all the more difficult when these patrons take down their receivers every time the operator attempts to ring out on the line. Any order made in this case, therefore, with reference to improvement of the central cffice will not result in remedying the conditions unless the farmers cooperate to the same extent by improving their own lines. rutting down the number on the lines and observing proper rules as to the use of their own instruments. It is further shown by Mr. Bridges, that with the exception of the Tuckerville farm line, which paid three month's switching fees for 1920, none of the other farm lines have paid their switching fees for the en - tire year of 1920. It appears to the Commission, therefore, that the patrons are not in a very good position to complain as to service so Ions as they refuse to pay their switching fees. The order in this case vill, therefore, be conditioned on the prompt payment by the fanners of their fees to defendant. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Oconto Telephone com - pany be and the same hereby is required to proceed to the purchase and installation of a new switchboard in its office at Oconto and to an overhauling of its central office equipment and distribution system in Oconto, it being a' condition of this order, however, that work on these Im - provements shall not comemnce until the fees for switching service, due from farm companies, shall be fully paid to April 1, 1921.

Deweese: For defendant â D. L. Sylvester, manager OPINION AND KINI)IN( COOK, Commissioner The complainants, by a petition signed by a major number of sub - scribers at Rising City exchange and also the farm lines leading out from said exchange, complain that the equipment used by the defendant is continually out of repair and entirely inadequate to supply regular and efficient telephone service. The Commission being aware of the poor service conditions over the lines of defendant, requested the engineering department of the Commission to make a thorough investigation of the conditions at the Rising City exchange and tributary farm lines, report - ing to this Commission the physical and service conditions, with the fol - lowing results, to-wit: "In re service complaint No. 5890, the Citizens of Rising City v. Surprise Telephone company, I wish to report that a test of service and an inspection of the physical property of the Rising City ex - change owned and operated by the Surprise Telephone company was made by myself on February 2 and 3, 1921, and the following condi - tions of service and property were found. "The switchboard was found in fair physical condition and giving good service. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 "The distribution system is a full metallic open wire system. The distribution system in town is in very poor physical condition on account cf slack wire and trees, which are the cause of a great amount of trouble in windy weather. This part of this exchange is to be rebuilt in the early spring of 1921. The subscribers in town had no complaint against the service between stations in town but did have a complaint against service when calling a farm line station. "The farm lines were tound to be in a poor physical condition wHh a great amount of tree interference. Such tree conditions, in connection with the slack condition of some of the' wire, would cause a great amount of trouble in windy weather. At the time of this inspection and test, very little wind was blowing and all lines were found to be "clear" and giving a reasonably good service. AH the subscribers talked with, said that the service had improved re - cently but said that when trouble did come on the lines it took too long for the trouble man to get around to clear the lines. "The Surprise Telephone company keeps only one regular trouble man, who is stationed at Surprise and takes care of the trouble on the entire property, with exchanges at Surprise and Rising City, having a total of 542 stations, which I think is more than one man can do properly, considering the amount of territory covered and present physical condition of the property. "The territory served by the Surprise Telephone company had a sleet storm on or about January 21, 1920, which may have caused pan of the above conditions but from information gained from the sub - scribers I talked with and my inspection would say the conditions as found have existed for sometime past." On this showing the Commission immediately called for a formal hearing on this complaint, to be held at Rising City, March 11, 1921, at 10 o'clock a. m. This hearing was attended by a large number of sub - scribers and also represented by counsel. At this inquiry the testimony of several subscribers from each farm line universally corroborated the contention in applicant's petition: { 1 I That the exchange at Rising City was not being kept in repair in a manner to give a dependable service to the subscribers, the lines and equipment were not in any way adequate to give a permanent and satisfactory service. â  (2) That the same broken down condition exists on all farm lines tributary to the Rising City exchange. The testimony discovered that on the farm lines the wires were often down, several poles per mile broken and hanging loose, many insulators off, wires generally slack, with con - siderable tree interference, and especially in windy weather service was very poor and in many cases entirely out for long periods; that many of the instruments on these farm lines were old and in bad state of repair and should be replaced with more modern telephones. (3) That the lineman and operators are giving the best service they </seg>

It is evident to this Commission that one lineman as employed by this company cannot be expected to take care cf 550 stations and give much of his time to repairs and new construction, but we do think that lie could do a sufficient amount of repair work, together with his regular duties, to bring satisfactory results, provided the lines and exchange in question were put in good workable condition by a competent foreman and helpers. The Comission is convinced that there has been a serious neglect by the management as to supervision of all help employed by the company and it recommends improvement in this particular. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska Stati- Railway Com - mission that the Surprise Telephone company be, and it hereby is. di - rected to proceed without delay, with a competent foreman and helpers, to place its lines and exchange at Rising City in good and substantial workable condition: that the service be improved in a degree that will insure a continued service to the subscriber at all times during hours of service: that such improvements be begun immediately and con - tinued until the properties be brought to a condition herein specified, not later than July 1, 1921; that reports be made each week by the telephone company to the State Railway Commission covering work done, carrying out the provisions of this order. That if the proper construction is not earnestly proceeded with as herein required, the Commission will institute action against the com - pany to compel specific performance of this order.

In the matter of the application of the Monroe Independent Telephone Company for authority to issue and Mil 161,500 of it* common stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 177 SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER. TAYLOR. Chairman This matter occurs again on the prayer of applicant for a rehearing and modification of the various orders issued in this case. The original application asked for the approval of $55,000 of stock to cover the pur - riiase by the Monroe Independent Telephone company of the property of the Albion Independent Telephone company and lor $6500 of stock to fund money borrowed for additions and betterments, making a total of .$61,500 applied for. In the original and supplemental orders we ap - provrd only $54,211 and applicant now prays for a further modification of order so as to permit the issuance of the full amount originally asked n support of its motion in the present proceeding applicant avers that the Commission erred in fixing the amount of the sacrifice of the stockholders in the Ablion and Monrce properties: that it erred in refus - ing to allow the full purchase price of the Albion property; and that it cried in accepting certain figures presented by its engineering depart - ment in the physical valuation submitted by that department. This rase has been so thoroughly reviewed by the Commission in the original and supplemental orders that it is unnecessary to recite any of the rinancial history of the company except as it may be incidental to the issues involved in the instant motion. . The Commission reached its original conclusion on the theory that should ascertain the present fair value of the consolidated proper- ties, and having ascertained such value to authorize the issuance of stock in that amount. In determining the fair value of the property the Commission relied on three main factors, viz.: the book cost of the two properties: the physical value on an original cost basis; and the invest - ment or sacrifice of the stockohlders. Emphasis was placed on the latter factor. The books of the two companies showed a consolidated value of $117,946. The Comission's engineer found an original cost of the consolidated property of $157,239 and a depreciated cost of $111, - 169. The company's engineer returned a reproduction cost new of $206. - tiS8 and a depreciated cost of $149,414. For reasons set out in the orig - inal order the Commission declined to accept the value returned by the company's engineer preferring to rely on 'the report made by its own department. We found the stockholder's saccrifice for the Albion prop - erty to be $24,629 and for the Monroe property $76,625, or a total of $101,254. To the later figure we added five per cent for working capital ;md allowed as a fair value of the property $106,736, for which stock was authorized to be issued. While it was claimed at the original hearing that the stockholders of the Monroe company had performed substantial services for which </seg>
            <seg id="p105">TOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 178 they had never been compensated and for which credit should be al - lowed in determining the owners' sacrifices, the Commission held that the record was insufficient to warrant any allowance for this purpose. More specific showing is made in the present record, figures being submitted in support of the amount of $8104.20. This covers the hauling of poles, labor performed in construction and other services performed in the construction period of the Monroe company. There is no doubt but that such services were performed. At this late date it is impoossible to measure their precise amount or the value Of the same as of the period when they were contributed. â The record convinces us, however, that Eeideration should be given to this factor and H is probable that eral thousand dollars were contributed in this way. Upon rehear - an error of $900 in the investment of the original owners, of the Albion property was found. As originally calculated the figure was $10,629. This should be increased by $900, making the figure $U,52&lt;J. fpli&lt;-ant contends for an allowance of eight per cent return on all erred dividends and uncompensated services. The Commission made such allowance in the original order. The claim is based on the theory that the money thus deferred and which should properly have been paid 'to the stockholders was used in the construction of the plant and as such was entitled to an earning in the same manner and amount as other capital. There is force to this argument, but the theory' must be applied in moderation. For instance, in this particular case the application of the full eight per cent return to both deferred dividends and to the value of services produces a total investment of $155,553. This, it will be noted, exceeds the present value of the property even as returned by applicant's own engineer and greatly exceeds the depre - ciated value found by our own engineering department. The pyramid - ing of these allowances demonstrates the unreliable nature of such cal - culations. We are of the opinion, however, that allowance in a reason - able measure should be made for a deferred return and consideration will be given to this factor in reaching our conclusion herein. It is urged quite vigorously, with figures to support the contention, that the Commission's engineer omitted considerable portions of the property when he made his inventory and fell into error in classifying certain portions of the property reported. With respect to one item there can be no question but that the claim is well founded. As to the Newman Grove exchange, the engineer reported only 198 rural telephones as being served from the Newman Grove exchange. Applicant's engineer reported 456 telephones. Neither figure apparently was correct. The annual reports of the company, two of which were submitted during the period when these valuations were made, show that on January 31, 19H5, there were 436 farm subscribers on the Newman Grove exchange and a report presented for the year ending June 30, 1916, showed 383 farm subscribers. It is found upon examination that the field sheets </seg>
            <seg id="p106">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 179 of the Commission's engineer were correct but an error had been made in computing the number of stations on the Newman Grove exchange it seems, therefore, that at the time of the investigation the compan&gt; bad approximately 436 farm subscribers at Newman Grove, making a net addition to our engineering department's figure of 238. The unit coat of these telephones installed, as found by our engineer, wass 115.50. On this basis they would have an original cost value of 13.689, or a present value, depreciated on a seventy per cent basis, of $2582. These amounts should be added to the respective figures showing the original cost and depreciated value of the consolidated property and making the latter figure $113,751. The claim of ommissions and improper classification as to other portions of the property is based almost wholly upon the testimony of K. B. Dannals, secretary and manager of the Monroe com pany since its organization. Mr. Dannals superintended the construction of the plant and has been in close touch with its maintenance. He die uot re-inventory the property, however, nor did he make any extendei re-check of the quantities. He testified largely from his general knowl edge of the property and from his memory as to the amount of materials purchased for the various exchanges. He readily admitted on cross examination that portions of the plant had been reconstructed three times and that the material purchased might have been, and probably Tras, used for that purpose and for that reason bore but little relation to the amount in place at the present time. While the record shows that the Commission's engineer did not make as thorough a check of the Monroe plant as he did of the Albion, there appears not to have been much difference in this regard as between his work and that of Mr Hurd, the company's engineer. It is likely that some property was over looked, but conclusive evidence is lacking that there was any consider able amount. As indicated above, counsel for applicant contends that under the statute clothing the Commission with power to regulate security issues the Commission is required 'to authorize the issuance of capital for money expended by a public service corporation where it is "reason - ably required for the acquisition of property." (Without discussing the question at length, because it is unnecessary for the purposes ot" this case, the Commission is convinced that such a construction of the law is not warranted. Such a rigid application of the statute would pre - clude the Commission from exercising any discretion as to whether or not the purchase of property by a public utility was judicious and pro - per. On counsel's theory the company could pay any price, no matter how excessive, for property it might be able to use for utility purposes and the Commission would be bound to issue securities to the full amount without being permitted to exercise its own judgment as to whether the amount was reasonable. In the present instance applicant purchased the Albion property at a cost of $55,000 when the present </seg>
            <seg id="p107">180 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT value or the same, as returned by its own engineer, was found to be only $50,934.21, a figure, as we found in the original case, to be very liberal. Because we were of the opinion that the amount paid for the Ebion property was somewhat greater than it was worth, we disri - rded the transaction in reaching a final value of the property, pre - rring to determine the question of the total issue ol' stock on the basis of the fair value of the consolidated property as a whole. We see no reason at this time to change that conclusion. There does ap - pear, however, good reascn lor modifying our finding as to the fair value of the property. To authorize the issuance of the full $114,025 of i-tock, as asked for, would require the approval of the issuance cf $7280 additional stock at this time. Without specific findings as to the various points raised and discussed herein, the Commission is of the opinion â¢hat the record justifies the issuance of the additional stock. It is within the depreciated value of the property, as found by our own K;ineer, which,' being based on original cost, is a minimum figure, e additional stock as prayed for will therelore be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the original and .â nipplemenlitl orders in this case be amended so as to authorize the issuance by the Monroe Independent Telephone company of $61,500 of its common stock instead of the $54,211 heretofore authorized.

            <seg id="p108">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 181 by this Commission authorizing this applicant to increase telephone rates as follows: Business service from $1.50 to $2.00, net; residence service, single-party, from $1.00 to $1.25, net; residence service, multi - party, from $1.00 to $1.15, net; farm line service from $1.00 to $1.50, gross, and $1.25, net; switching service from $4.00 per annum to $6.00 per annum, gross, and $5.00, per annum, net. These rates were to â terminate June 30, 1920, unless extended. The company was required as a condition of the order to keep its accounts in such a manner as to entirely separate electric light business from the telephone business, and -,vas required further to set up a proper amount for maintenance of its service and its property. These conditions have been met. The Commission also recommended that an additional operator be i â¢nployed during the peak hours of each day, on account of the very large amount of short-distance toll business being done by the com - pany. No such operator has been employed, and the company inform - ally states that to employ an additional operator would, in its judg - cent, be poor economy. The exchange is composed of 396 stations, entirely grounded, and switches for 51 independently owned stations. The telephone company is operated by its present owner in conjunction with an electric light plant, and certain economies are thereby possible which could not be possible if the two enterprises were operated independently of each oiher. The showing for the first five months of 1921 indicates that the com - j.any has set aside the amount designated for upkeep of the plant, nas paid all operating expenses, has set aside for accrued taxes and interest, and has a profit and loss account of $579, out of which dividends may be paid. This is somewhat more than the equity in the property, rep - resented by the value over and above indebtedness, would warrant as a dividend showing. The rates, however, are somewhat below the aver - age rates in the state for a similar class of service, and are made pos - sible only by the combination of the two businesses under one manage - ment and by very careful management on the part of the present owner It is not the desire of the Commission to penalize economy. The Com missicn is not, however, satisfied that the service rendered is as good as it should be. For that reason the present rates will be extended for a period o sixty days, beginning July 1, 1921. Hearing will be held on July 28, a Arcadia, Nebraska, in order to ascertain whether or not service condi tions should be improved, and to take such action on the rate schedule as all the facts in the case may warrant. (This extension of sixty days does not complicate matters, because the company is collecting from both rural and town subscribers monthly in advance. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3308 In the Matter of the Application of the Arcadia Electric Light &amp; Tele - phone Company for an Increase in Telephone Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman: L Effective December l, 1920, the Commission authorized a schedule of increased rates for this company, this schedule to remain in effect until June 30, 1921. For certain reasons expressed in its supplemental order, issued on June 30, 1921. the Commission extended the trial period for another two months and set the whole matter down for hearing at Arcadia on July 28. At the hearing a large number of farmers appeared to protest against the continuation of the farm rate, which is now $1.25 ;-er month. They had previously filed a petition with applicant demand - ing that the farm rate be restored to ?1.00 per month and threatening to remove their telephones if their demand was not complied with. None of the other subscribers of applicant filed protest or were present at the hearing to object to a continuation of the rates. Applicant company, at the hearing, submitted a detailed showing of its operating revenues and expenses. It is now keeping in a very satis - factory manner its accounts in accordance with the Commission's uni - form system of accounting. Until June 1st, it filed with the Commission a monthly statement showing its revenues and expenses. At that time. however, it was relieved of the duty of furnishing this statement because the reports showed that the accounts were being kept in a manner fully to </seg>
            <seg id="p110">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 183 comply with the Commission's requirements. A summary of the reve- nues and expenses for the seven months' period from January 1, to August 1, 1921, is as follows REVENUES City subscribers _ $1,725.00 Farm subscribers 2,203.63 Switching service 165.75 Toll revenue 718.47 Sundry sales 4.28 Totnl revenue : $4,817.13 EXPENSES Current maintenance $1,045.55 Salaries of officers : 525.00 Salaries of clerks 265.00 Rents _ 105.00 Stationery and printing 4.08 Office supplies 129.98 4.08 Office supplies Other general expense 65.53 Total $3,197.98 J3.197.98 Operating income 1,619.15 Deductions: Taxes and interest 701.15 Net income $ 918.00 These figures indicate that as a result of the seven months' opera- tion the company has a net income of $918.00, -with which to pay a re- turn on its investment, exclusive of interest on its indebtedness. This vould indicate a small surplus over and above a reasonable return as a result of the year's operations on the present rates. There are some striking features with reference to the operation of this company, how- ever, which merit attention. On August l, applicant had outstanding uncollected rentals in the amount of $2,249.35. From $1,500 to $1,800 of this amount was owed by farm subscribers. It is manifest that if the company did not have an unusually large toll revenue because of certain toll lines which It ovrns, and if it was not jointly operated with an electric light plant, it would not have 'been able to have paid its operating expenses during the past seven months. The advantage which the company enjoys bv reason of its connection with the electric light plant Is strikingly dls- lepreciation 354.45 )perators Power Ither traffic $1,400.00 11,400.00 $ 685.5$ 17.50 .30 </seg>

The accounting department of the Commission recently com - led statistics covering eighty-three independent companies in the state, i he two large companies being excluded from this study. For ease in comparison and following the usual method, the operating costs are reduced to a per subscriber basis. The statement of the eighty-threi - â companies and the figures for the Arcadia company are set out as follows : Arcadia Elec. 83 Ind. Cos. Light &amp; Tele. Co. Current maintenance per station. $6.68 $4.21 Traffic expense per station 5.15 .!.26 Commercial expense per station 4.19 2.76 Operators wages per station 4.77 2.97 Officers salaries iJ*q- station 1.76 2.27 This comparison bears testimony to the economical manner in which the telephone plant at Arcadia is being conducted. It explains Why the rates at that point at the present time, even with the increases as author - ized by the Commission, are lower than for any telephone exchange ill that territory. Mr. Wait, the owner and manager of the compay. divides his time between the telephone plant and the electric light business. The lineman which he hires does the same. The result is that the cost to bcth companies is materially less than though each was operating under separate ownership, where each would have to bear the cost of the full time of both men. There is no complaint as to the service furnished by applicant, it being generally admitted by the farmers at the hearing that the service was all that could be expected. One instance was cited where a tele - phone "was out of order for sometime, but such a case, is likely to occur i:t any time and it was admitted by the complainant that the company made effort to remedy the trouble. It would probably improve th&gt; - service somewhat if another operator could be put on duty during the peak hours. As a matter of fact, this was recommended by the Com - mission in its original order in this case. Our investigation at this hearing indicated, however, that this is not essential to good service. Applicant stated that it had been the plan to secure a third operator, but the attitude of the farm subscribers in threatening to with - draw their patronage will probably make this impossible for the time being. The facts as they are presented in this record point unmistakably to a continuation of the present rates. As stated, they are materially less than the rates Charged by companies in the same territory, and less than the rates generally charged for similar service throughout the State. It is manifest that applicant is operating- on a very eco&gt; - nomical basis and giving service as good as can be expected from a </seg>

To restore the rates to the old basis would SO decrease the revenues of the company as to make it impossible to main - tain its plant and continue to give service. This company operated dur - ing the war period and up to December 1, 1920, on rates that had been in effect for many years. Without question, it operated at a loss during much of the period of high prices. To compel it to return now to the old basis and to participate in the losses which it is said others are Glaring because of present business conditions, would violate tbe equities as between the company and its subscribers and would be a very effective means of confiscating the property of the company. The Commission has neither the desire nor the power to pursue such a course.

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman: This is an application by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Rail - way company for emergency relief. The present rates which were made effective August 10, 1919, are as follows: Cash fare , 7c Tickets, four for _ 25c Children over five and not more ihan 12 years of age. 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p113">186 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT fares for 30c School tickets _... 5C The usual transfer privileges were retained in effect by the order. In (bit application it is asked to increase the fares to the following basis Adult cash lares 8c Adult ticket fares, lour for 30c Children's tickets 4c In support of its prayer for emergency relief applicant submits a state- ment shoving the revenues and expenses for 1920. and an estimate based very largely on its experience for the month of April for the year 1921. The 1920 showing is as follows, the figures given being intended tÂ« cover the operation on the Nebraska side only: Total revenues 13,955,662.97 Total expenses 3.339,270.01 Net inome _ $ 616.392.96 Deductions : Interest $480,950 Dividends 200,000 Total $680,950 $ 680,950.00 Deficit $ 63,702.00 The estimate for 1921 is as follows: Total revenues $3,748,979.96 Total expenses 3.379.489.67 Net inome $ 369.490.29 Deductions: Interest $4Â«05o Dividends _ 200.000 Total $680,950 $ 680,950.00 Deficit _ $ 31 1.460.00 The company estimates that the increased revenue from the rates which it proposes would amount to $722,725.32. It is contended that this sum is required if a return on the fair value of the property is to be realized. As a suggestion as to other rates, the company submits two other proposals, the first to be a cash fare of 7c with no reduction for tickets and children's tickets at 2 ! -&lt;-. It is estimated this increase would produce additional revenue of $403,320. while a 7c i'ash fare. three tickets for 20c and children's tickets at 3^4c would result in $231,402 added revenue, the assumption in all of these calculations being that the number of car riders will continue to be the same as they were In 1920. Commencing practically with the present general buisness depre.s sion, the traffic of the company began to decline. With the exception </seg>
            <seg id="p114">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 187 of the last week in January and the first two weeks in February, this has continued without interruption since the first of the year. While it has fluctuated from week to week, the reduction in the number of revenue passengers carried has been between lour and five per cent, as compared with the same period a year ago. This rate of loss has con - tinued up to the date of the last report, which was for the week of August 15th to 21st. when the loss amounted to 6.1 per cent. The week of August 8th to 15th, showed a loss of 4.6 per cent. In estimating the revenue for the year 1921. applicant used the experience of April as a basis. This showed a loss of 5.57 per cent. The actual experience of the company discloses ihat this estimate was somewhat too high as the average has not been to exceed 4% per cent. The revenue actually col - lected, therefore, has been larger than the estimate. The net deficit for that reason has been correspondingly reduced. The loaa in traffic does not appear to be increasing and it is fair to assume that it will continue for the remainder of the year at its present rate. Under the estimate based on April experience the net income would have lacked $111,460 of paying the interest on the Nebraska proportion of the out - sianding bonds, which in the aggregate amount to |10,000,ooo. The sctual net deficit for the period January to July inclusive was $29,009.19; month. On this basis the total deficit for the year would amount to $49i"30.O4, which is $61,730 less than estimated. Applicant has outstanding $4,000,000 in preferred stock, covering the property as a whole. Dividends of 5 per cent on this $4,000,000 Of preferred stock would amount to $200,000. This added to the pros - pective deficit in bond interest indicates a total deficit for the year of $250,000. There is thus presented a serious situation, for the company must, if it maintains its credit, at least pay the interest on its out - standing bonds and it should, if its general credit is to be sustained, be able to pay the dividends on its preferred stock. This is essential to the continuation of good service and the public, for this reason, i9 as vitally concerned in the payment of the interest and the dividends as are the stockholders and the management. The applicant asserts that its only remedy is to again increase rates. It is quite obvious, however, that it does not require $725,000 of added money, merely to meet interest on the bonds and dividends on the preferred stock. This is an emergency proceeding and applicant stipulates orally that it will accept, as the measure of its immediate necessities, a net return sufficient to pay the interest on its bonds and dividends on its preferred stock. Any question of an earning upon "fair value" must await the outcome of the Commission's investigation. Which is now in progress and which it is hoped to conclude at an early date. Consideration of the evidence in this record and of general indus - trial and financial conditions ol which it must take cognizance, leads </seg>
            <seg id="p115">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 188 thÂ« commission to the conclusion that relief for this company lies not n again raising its rates, but in reducing, if that be possible, its operat - ng costs. Other industries and other street railways have found Such course possible, if not imperative, and there appears to be no reason why this company should continue to be an exception. Wages paid abor have receded to a marked degree throughout the country. An xhaustive investigation, made by this Commission during the summer r 1920, prompted by a threatened strike, disclosed that applicant was t that time paying its trainmen wages that were in most cases as high nd in several cases higher than those paid for work in other occu - tatiOuS Of a comparable nature. It was shown also that as the pay of rainicen had been increased from time to time, the pay of machinists, hopmen, trackmen, car laborers and others had been correspondingly dvancei'.. No substantial reductions have been made since that 111 - estigation was completed. The time appears to be ripe therefore, for ction on the part of applicant looking to a readjustment of its labor osts down to a basis comparable with that experienced by other indus - ries. Laboring men in other walks of life, whose wages have been educed and who are compelled to use the Cars to go to and from their Work, have a right to ask that wages paid street railway men be re - uced also, if ihat is necessary to prevent a further increase in fares. his being on the assumption that street railway wages were raised uring the war period to meet abnormal conditions. It is not for this Commission tO say what this reduction should be. That is wholly a question of management. We can only assume what may, within reason be accomplished as a basis for our conclusions in this case. The total abor cost of the company averages approximately $130,000 per month. or $1,560,000 per year. This is exclusive of general officers, superin - c-ndents and clerical forces. In our opinion it should not be unreason - able to expect a reduction Of from 10 to 15 per cent, considering the cuts made in other industries. If we assume an average reduction Of 2 per cent, which happens to be the figure found reasonable by the Federal Labor Board for steam railway employes, the saving to appli - cant would amount to approximately $15,600 per month or $187,200 per â¢ear. This figure may be more or less, varying somewhat with the method of applying reductions. Some classes of employes who received substantial advances during the war period may now be called upon for greater than the average decrease, while other classes, whose level of wages for some reason has not been materially liftd, may now be exempted from the horizontal reduction. This is wholly a matter of managerial discretion with which we do not presume to interfere. Without stating conclusions as to what should be done, we think it necessary to suggest that the management may very well consider. under the Circumstances as they now exist, the salaries paid to general officers. Eight men in this class receive combined compensation of f58,700 annually. Men actively identified with the management of a </seg>
            <seg id="p116">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 189 large street railway and giving their mil tfnie to the work are entitled t liberal compensation, because the work calls for long training, special ability and close application to duty. The excellent service and the good condition of this property are proof that 'this company has had in the past, and now has. men of this type at its head. It may very urefl be doubted, however, whether all of the men im its official roster are performing service of sufficient amount or value to warrant : the salaries they receive. This criticism applies only to those officers who render only nominal service. â  Applicant may with confidence expect a recession in .material costs, although because of the quantities used and the fact that reserves already purchased at high prices are not exhausted, the saving from this source will not be immediately noticeable. The trend is downward. however, ami the reduction should soon have its influence on operating costs. Coal, which is a substantial factor in the cost of operation, promises to be no lower in price this winter. Indeed, because of con - tracts already necessarily entered into, its aggregate cost will be greater this year than last. In its order issued in August. 1919. this Commission indicated its approval of an allowance of $500,000.00 annually- for depreciation, although it did not specifically order this amount to be set aside. Com - mencing with that lime, however, the company increased, its allowance for this purpose to $480,000 annually. Prior to that time the amount had been $300,000 for several years. It was claimed by the company in 1919 that increasing costs of labor and material made the $300,000 then set aside for depreciation, insufficient. The evidence as to increases in these costs was conclusive, and as the renewal and maintenance of the I&gt;lant so that service can be maintained is the first duty of the com - pany, the Commission authorized the increase in the allowance, but made it a condition of the order that the money thus set aside should be expended for this purpose only, any unexpended balance to be kept in "cash, bank deposit, or invested in such securities only as are readily marketable." Applicant has complied with this provision and there was in the fund as of December 31. 1920, $471,298.55, $53,791.91 of which was cash and $417,506.64 was in bonds and other investments. The Commission is without sufficient information on this record to iletermine the exact amount that applicant requires for depreciation. Sufficient information is dependent on an extended experience covering a period of yearss, and further investigations which are to be made in the permanent rate case should enable this Commission to arrive at a definite figure. We are strongly persuaded at this time, however, that the present allowance is greater than is required. If we are correct in assuming that 'abor costs can be reduced, whatever reduction is thus accomplished will be proportionately reflected in the sum required for depreciation. In addition to the $480,000 set aside for depreciation. </seg>
            <seg id="p117">190 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT -which covers the entire property, applicant erpends large sums far current maintenance. In 1920 the total expenditure for maintenance and depreciation for tbe Nebraska property was 1812,685.74. The main - tenance expenditures, likewise, -will be very materially affected by re - duction in labor costs. The company's depreciation reserve on Decem - ber 31, 1920, amounted to $2,416,925.02. This represents a substantial increase during the past five years. The evidence at hand is sufficiently complete to justify the conclusion that the present allowance of f480,00(t per year is more than is required and that a portion of the reserve may very properly and safely be applied to other and much more pressing needs of the company. For this reason the restriction made in our order of August, 1919, prohibiting the use of the fund for any other purpose than that set up, will be removed, thus permitting applicant to avail itself of at least a portion of the $471,298, which is in cash or liquid assets. The remainder of the depreciation reserve is very largely invested in additions and ibetterments to the property and under present circumstances is not available. In addition it had a surplus on Decem - ber 31. 1920, of $204,304, and had on hand as of that date in materials and supplies $421,326. With the economies that should be realized from fuction in wages and by the use of a portion of its depreciation re - ve allowance the company should be well able to meet its interest bonds and its dividend on preferred stock, making any increase in its rates unnecessary. Because of the existing industrial depression, the large number ol unemployed and the prevailing discontent, it is impossible to estimate or forecast the effect of an increase of fares. In other word?, an In - crease, unless it was very slight, might result in accelerating the present loss in traffic to the point where added revenue could not be secureit. In our opinion the necessities of the company at this time do not make t necessary to assume the hazard of such a loss. We have suggested an alternative a policy of economy, the prime factor in which is a reduction of wages. This, together with the use of available reserves. gives strong promise of carrying the company through the present crisis. Necessarily, this conclusion is based on estimate?. The com - pany, even with the best of efforts, may not succeed in accomplishing the economies we think possible. In that event there will be but one other course â the securing of the necessary revenue through some further increase in rates. If the remedy we now suggest does fail, we shall not hesitate to adopt the other, since street railway transportation lor the city of Omaha is too vital to the welfare of that community to be permitted to languish or ride into disaster for want of revenue to pay for its maintenance.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. H. G. Taylor. Chairman. Attest: John S. Curtiss, Secretary. (SKA I.) Browne, Commissioner (concurring) It may be that we are offering this applicant a stone when he has â ome seeking bread. The company cannot continue to serve effectively. and possibly not at all, it present conditions are not remedied. The judgment of the Commission as to the extent of economics of operation that can be perfected may prove erroneous. Officials of the company, more familiar with its problems than the Commission can be, may find these economies impossible in their full extent. It may be said, with support from court decrees, thai the Commis - sion in this finding is invading the province of management more than ran be permitted legally. If, however, that is true the Commission in rate matters can be but little more than an auditing body. I realize that suggestions as to levels of wages must be made by us with due caution because of the lack of intimate contact with the business detail of the company, and I am sure they are thus made. This utility is second to none in the country in point of good serv - ice and modern equipment. It has made an enviable record during the period of high operating costs, although part of that record for high class service in spite of costs was made at the expense of the security holders, even at a time when ordinary business was making more than normal profits, which is best shown by a comparison of 1916 and 1920 conditions. In 1 91 C the gross revenue from the entire system, from all sources </seg>
            <seg id="p119">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 192 was $3,253,327 and in 1920, when operating expenses were at the maxi- mum $4,807,530. an increase in dollars of 47.8 per cent. Total expenses. less fixed charges, -were $1,833,146 in 1916 and in 1920 amounted to $3,603,678, an increase of 96.6 per cent. The net for dividends was by this fact reduced from $510,136 in 1916 to $168,414 in 1920, and as has been pointed out in the opinion, the first seven months of 1921 show* less than nothing lor dividends in that time. Subject to the criticism already made of the depreciation reserve the reasons for the tremendous increases in costs, beyond all possible increases in revenues at the rates allowed, are shown by a comparison of items of operating expense in 1916 and 1920. Expense Item 1916 1920 Maintenance of way and structures $ 89,053 5 185.99H Depreciation of way and structures 162.000 288,000 (a) Expended (145,143) ( 90,412) (b) Accrued ( 16.857) (197.588) Maintenance of equipment 124,083 287,082 Depreciation of equipment 54,000 96,000 (a) Expended (20.172) (12,561) (b) Accrued - (33,828) (83,439) Power cost 211,485 512,071 Fuel cost - (164,018) (369,356) Transportation total cost 757,681 1,744,125 Superintendence 21,362 45.664 Trainmen 635.16(1 1.429,89:1 Carhouse employes 59,084 178,397 All other expense 42,075 90,171 General and misc. total expense 320.716 420,49Ss Sals, and expense general officers 46,529 49,846 Sals, and expense clerks â 23,669 50.423 Injuries and damages 184,159 202,398 All other general expense 66.357 117. 8S By reference to the tabulation above it will be seen that whatev criticism is carried in the opinion in this case regarding salaries pa to officers whose duties are at best only nominal, relates equally to period before high operation costs. However, just that criticism ma&gt; be it can easily be seen that any proper correction thereof by the board of directors does not in any appreciable manner solve the problem In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for Authority to Increase Rates. </seg>

SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER Taylor, Chairman: Effective November 1. 191S. this Commission issued an order author - izing certain increase in rates lor the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph 'â ompany. which were made effective for six months, and at the end of tliat period 11 ntinued for a further period of six months. In the mean - time application of the company was made for a further increase in n-tes, which was granted and made effective July 1, 1919. These rates have heen extended by six-month periods sines that time and expire, under the terms of the last order, on June 30, 1921. The company has made application for a further continuation of the present exchange rates and in addition asks for a modification of its toll rates, the prin - cipal feature of which is a change in the relationship between the per - : on to person and station to station calls. That part of the application relating to toll will be considered separately, and only the exchange laies will be discussed in this order. Healing on the application of the company lo extend its rates was held on June 29. 1921. The only protest presented at the time of the hearing was that an behalf of certain switched farm lines connected with the company's exchange at Shickley, and certain ether farm lines connected at (ieneva. Evidence was submitted on behalf of the Shick - ley farmers, but at the conclusion of the hearing it was agreed that the company would make a separate showing as to the cost of switching at Shickley. If it does not prove satisfactory to the patrons at that point, a further hearing will be held. The switching rates at present in effect will be continued, pending the final outcome of this investigation. The application for the further extension of existing exchange rates is based on a showing by the company for the full year 1920 and for five months of 1921. At the hearing held in December, 1919, the company submitted an estimate of its revenues and expenses for the year 1920, based on five months actual experience in 1919. At this time it sub - mits in great detail the actual figures which disclose the results of op - eration for 1920. In the estimate referred to it was predicted that the rates then renewed would produce a surplus of $15,855.07. That this esti - mate was too liberal is evident by the fact that the actual experience of the company shows a deficit for the year of $12,978. The difference of $28,000 between the estimate and the actual experience was due to in - creased expenses which could not be anticipated at the time the esti- </seg>
            <seg id="p121">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 194 ir.ate was made. For exam pit*. $20,000 of the amount was due to au in - crease in taxes. The average cost of operation per station per month for 1920 was $2,218 as against $2,076 for 1919. showing i'.n increase per subscriber per month of over 14c per station. It is urged in this connection that the peak of operating coats lias been reached, and that there will be sharp reductions' in .material anil iHbor costs in the near future. It is even argued that these reductions lave already been experienced to such an extent as to make the present scale of rates unnecessary. The experience Of this company, however, does not indicate that the reduction of either labor or materials has been sufficient to justify any reduction in revenue. The experience of live months operation in 1!I21 shows a slight recession in costs, the aver - age cost per month per statirn for 1920, as stated above, being $2.21. while for the five months period it was $2,126. The ccmpany has made every effort to reduce ils expenses, the testimony showing that pur - chases of materials have been made sparingly, and only la sufficient quantities to meet the imperative needs of maintenance and construction. Wages are at practically the same point as they were six months ago. although reductu ns in the plant department have been accomplished to some extent. It should be noted in this connection, however, that wages paid by this company were not advanced in the same proportion as they were in other lines of work somewhat similar. This is well indicated by exhibits presented by tin* company. This means, therefore, that until there are greater reductions than have yet taken place in other lines. it will "be impossible for this company to greatly reduce its costs. As labor constitutes fully 96 per cent of the operating cost of the telephone company, it is apparent that relief cannot be realized from this source in the immediate future Many employes of the plant department of the company remained in service and did loyal work during; the war period notwithstanding much higher wages were paid for similar work by other industries. It would be a poor reward to these men l'or their faithful services to make substantial cuts in their wages at this time. The Commission has given careful consideration to whether or not the company is making every effort to operate its plant efficiently and ecrnomically. Our investigation is convincing that not only is every effort along that line being made, hut that such efforts are productive of results. That the company is securing results along this line is indi - cated by a comparison of its direct operating costs with that of the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, the largest company operating in this state. This comparison, based on the figures for the year 1920. as as fo'lows: Nebraska Tele- Lincdn Tele - phone Co. phone Co. Current maintenance ; .537 .605 .706 .627 </seg>
            <seg id="p122">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 Tin- comparison for the first five months of 1921 shows $2,882 as the total lor the Nebraska company and $2,126 for the Lincoln company, mak - ing a difference of .756 per subscriber per month. Not only is the company operating efficiently and at a. reasonably low cost, but iis financing has been on an equally conservative basis. Throughout the entire war period it has paid 7 per cent on its common stock, and G per cent on practically all of its preferred stock with the exception of a few thousand dollars of special preferred stock upon which it lias paid 6 per cent. These payments nave resulted in an aver - age of 5.8 per ceni pr.id in dividends on capital obligations. In view of The very conservative capitalization of this company, this constitutes a remarkable record and indicates the good standing which the company has throughout the territory in which it operates. So far the company lias largely financed itself locally through the sale of common stock on lhe basis of 7 per cent. Its necessary extensions and betterments re - quire from a half to three-quarters Of a million dollars annually. This year its budget requirements for imperative improvements and exten - sions aggregate approximately $500,000. it is doubtful under present conditions ot the money market, with gilt edge securities paying from 7VÂ£ per cent to 9 per cent, whether the company will be able to dispose of its r( niiinin stock on a 7 per cent basis. It will be unfortunate to the 1 iiblic which it serves if it should get into a position where it could not continue to dispose of its common stock at par. During the war period the company has not been able to add anything to its surplus. What surplus it has. moreover, is practically all invested in physical property and devoted to the public use. It is possible that by the practice of further economy the company will be able to break even in its operations lor the year 1921. It is obvious, however, that if it is to continue to i"ake the necessary improvements demanded by the public service, it cannot at this time suffer a reduction in revenues. The rates now in effect, therefore, will be continued for a further period of six months. if at the end of that time prices of material and labor have declined, or if there is prospect of their declining, it may be possible to make some rejuctii n in rates. At the present time the best interests of the patrons served by the company, as well as the company itself, demand a continua - tion of the present rates. ORDER.

            <seg id="p124">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 197 iiewal orders issued by the Commission since November 1, 1918. There have been two increases made during the period which have resulted in additional exchange revenue in the amount of approximately twenty six per cent. The application iierein is based ou a showing for the first â¢ toven months at 1921. This is supplemented also by a showing for the &gt;.t ven months period from May 1 to December 1, this being extended to .over the period since the last order went into effect. Hearing was had on this application, at which protestants representing three exchanges appeared. A small number of letters and telegrams from other exchanges were received, some of them protesting against any further increase, and others asking if possible a reduction be made at this time in the .'xistinx n.tes, due to economic conditions. During the eleven months of 1921 the company earned 5.99 per cent in its capital obligations and 5.35 r.er cent on the book vaiue of the average plum in service during thn period. The net earnings for No - vember did not maintain the ratio for the eleven months and represented net earning of but 4.67 per cent on the value of the average plant in servfc e. The less favorable showing tor November is due to a falling off in toll revenue and a slight increase in certain of the expenses. It is manifest from this showing that unless conditions give promise of -hurply changing for the better the company is not in such position as lo withstand a reduction in rates, and this brings us at once to the phase of the subject that has been uppermost in the mind of the Commission and in the minds of the large body of telephone patrons, viz: Has not Jie economic and industrial depression resulted in a decline in cost of later and material sufficient to justify the hcpe of materially reduced operating costs henceforth. Careful inquiry into this matter was made by the patrons at the time of the hearing. Anticipating such inquiry the company had prepared rather extensive statistical studies covering present conditions. These figures show that while there has been a very slight decline in labor cost and in the prices of materials used in tele - phone construction and operation it is so small as to leave the net in - come practically as it was during the past two years. For instance, in the first eleven months of 1920 the company earned 5.36 per cent on the average plant in service, whereas we have shown for the same period in litil the net income has amounted to 5.35 per cent on the average plant in service. In other words, the slight decreases in labor and materia expenses have been overcome by increases in taxes and by a small falling off in toll earnings. The exchange earnings for the eleven months period of 1921 have been slightly increased over the same period a year ago. due to an increase in the number of subscribers. Reducing the total telephone operating expenses to a per subscriber basis, the record shews that in 1917 these expenses averaged $1,643 per subscriber per month: in 1918. $1,749; in 1919. $2,076: in 1920, $2,211: and eleven months in 1921. $2,153. The gross revenue per subscriber in- </seg>
            <seg id="p125">198 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT creased from $2.36 in 1917 to $2,998 in 1920, and $2,079 in the eleven months of 1921. This comparison, it will be observed, shows the de - crease in expenses per subscriber tor the eleven months of 1921 to be less than six cents per momh. Reasons for tola Blight decline are well indicated by the exhibits submitted by the company. For example, the wages paid by the company in the month of November, while reduced to some degree in the spring of 1921, are still approximately sixty per cent higher than the wages paid all classes of employes in the month of November, 1915. The total amount of wages paid in November, 1915. aggregated $49,772, whereas the total wages paid in November, 1921, were $90,652. In connection with the exhibit presenting these figures the company also submits a showing as to the number of men and women Ciployed in November, 1915, compared to the number employed in No - mber, 1921. In November, 1915, the company had on its pay roll 531 men and 526 women. At that timf it owned and operated 45,883 sub - scribers stations. In November, 1921, it employed 506 men and 704 women, or a total of 1210. On that date, however, it had 66,028 sub - scribers stations in service. In other words, notwithstanding an in - crease of approximately fifty per cent in the number of its subscribers served, it employed only 150 additional employes and all but three oi Uiese are to be found in the corps ol operators. As a mater of fact the men engaged in the maintenance departments decreased from 439 to 413. It is stated somewhat more graphically by saying that for every 1000 telephones there were 23.04 employes in November, 1915, as against only 18.32 in November, 1921. No more convincing evidence could be sirbmited of the efforts of the company to economize. Since there are no general complaints as to service, it appears that these efforts toward tconomy have been accomplished without any decrease In efficiency. A comparison of the wages paid by this company to its men employes in the construction and maintenance departments with that of men engaged in like employment in the city of Lincoln shows conclusively that appli - cant is well under the wages paid by other industries. For instance, its scale for linemen, capable of doing miscellaneous work, is from $3.5o 10 $4.00 per day The city of Lincoln pays linemen lor similar service $6.00 per day. Groundmen are paid by applicant from $2.75 to $3.25 per day, while the city of Lincoln pays $4.00 per day. A study of the wage schedules indicates that the telephone company can hardly expect to make any substantial reductions until its competitors in the labor field re - duce their wages. This is true likewise of the women employed in the operating department. Prices of materials entering into the operation of a telephone plant Lave declined only slightly. The company submits an elaborate exhibit covering this mater, which is too extensive to present here. Since the figures are taken, however, from actual purchases made by the company lor the period from 1914 down to the present it may be said to accurately portray the conditions in the telephone material market. The company^ </seg>
            <seg id="p126">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 199 plant superintendent testified that it is the policy to buy in the open market and take advantage of quantity purchases as well as of any favor - able opportunities that may present themselves. This company is subject to the same increase in taxes as applies to all other properties in Nebraska at the present time. This increase is well indicated by the statement that the company paid per subscriber station in 1914 $1.17Â»6. In 1921 it has paid per subscriber station $2,445 an increase Of 107.2 per cent. The increase in dollars in the eleven months of 1921 over tlie same period in 1920 amounts to $15,183. The reduction made by the Commission in service connection charges, ef lective December 1. will result in reduced revenue to the company in the future. It is estimated, basing the study on the month of September 1921. that this reduction will amount to $953 per month, or a total of $11,440 for the year. Wire the rates charged by this company at the present time produc - ing a comfortable surplus it would be possible and equitable to require a reduction. Since the revenues it now receives produce a net income barely sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds and the dividends on the slock ii is obvious that any rate reduction is not now justified. Throughout the period of three years during which these increased rates have been in effect the Commission has maintained a conservative attl - tade in its estimates of revenues and expenses. In each of the six orders issued the Commision has expressed the hope and the belief that :&gt;peratinp costs would shortly begin to decline so that the rates could be reduced. These anticipated reductions have not been realized. The rec - ord in Uiis case discloses that the situation is but little, if any, improved and that there is no indication of an immediate decline in costs. In our opinion the company is making every effort to economize and the record in this cast- shows that it is accomplishing splendid results. Perhaps still further improvement can be made in that direction, although it la evident that the company cannot go so far in reducing expenses as to seriously impair its servce. We are cf the opnion, therefore, that the existing rates are reasonable under all the circumstances and that they should be continued. We believe, however, that present conditions are so uncertain and unstable as to make it unwise to make the present rates effective for any fixed period, but to leave these open to investigation by the Commission, either on its own motion or upon complaint, at any time. ORPER IT IS THEREFORE ORDKRED that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telo - straph company be and it hereby is authorized, an emergency existing, to continue to charge and collect the schedules of rates and chaTgiM now in effect until the further order of this Commission. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3718. In the matter of the Application of the Crownover Telephone company for authority to issue common stock. OPINION AND K1NDINC TAYLOR, Chairman: This is an application of the Crownover Telephone company for au - thority to issue $1,714.55 of its common stock as compensation to J. C. Grint, president of the company, for services rendered by him over he period of years frrm 190!) up to December 1915. Mr. Grint has been resident of the company, throoughout the greater period of its exist - nte. In the early days of the organization and particularly during the &gt;eriod lei'erred to above. Mr. Qftat gave much of his time to the af - eitl of the comi.any, receiving therefore only nominal compensation. He â¢ as concerned in putting the company on its feet and refrained from skin;; for a salary to fully cover his services. In. support of the ap - lication, Mr. Grint submitted a detailed statement, covering the serv - ces rendered by him from the time of his connection with the com - mny in 1909 down tc December, 1915, which shows the amount he ctually received for services performed and transportation vehicles furnished and the amount he thinks he should have received durins: the same period. The amount claimed by him for the period dis $2,145.3(1. whil the amount actually received was $430.75. The difference of $1,714.55 represents the amount for which stock is asked to be issued. The Commission has no means of determining whether the charges B; by Mr. Grint lor the services performed are exactly suuitable, since now eight or ten years since the work was performed. Conditions changed sharply since that time. The claim of Mr. Grint, however. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 201 is approved and recommended by W. W. Dye, W. H. Dunbar. A. M. Mutter and J. D. Crownover, who at the present time are directors and stockholders in the company. Some, if not all, of these gentlemen were connected with the company during the period under study and should be well advised as to the reasonableness of the charges made by Mr. (!rint. They can have no personal interest in the issuance of rile stock lo Mr. Grint other than their consideration for the general welfare of the company. The nÂ»t assets of the company at the present time are somewhat in excess of $30,000. The stock outstanding amounts to $25,620.97. The issuance of this stock in this amount has been approved by the Com - mission and reflects an actual investment by the stockholders in the property. It is manifest that the contribution cf services by Mr. Grint permitted the company to put the earnings thus saved into the property. Had Mr. Grint been fully paid during the period, the company would have had to issue additional stock to secure funds with which to provide .in equivalent amount of property. It is within the knowledge of the Commission that Mr. Grint has been very active in the service of the company and that much of its success from a financial and a service standpoint has been due to his efforts. While some criticism might be lodged against certain expense items claimed by him, it should not be cverlooked that he makes no claim for interest, which, if allowed, would properly offset any excess charges as claimed . In the opinion of the Commission, therefore, the issuance of the stock is reasonably required and should be approved. ORDER IT IE THEREORE ORDERED that the Crownover Telephone com - pany fee and the same hereby is authorized to issue its common stock at par. in the amount of $1,714.55, same to be issued as payment for .services rendered by J. E. Grint in behalf of said company. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the issuance of this stock and its receipt by Mr. J. E. Grint shall be accepted by him as payment in full for all services rendered by him for the company for the period up to January 1, 1916. Acknowledgment in writing to this effect shall be made by Mr. Grint within ten days after the issuance and receipt by him of said stock. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the stock herein approved shall be subject to all the conditions heretofore attached to the approval of previous issues of stock by this Commission. </seg>

Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL I APPLICATION NO. 3746. In the mater of the application of the Pawnee Telephone Company for authority to increase its exchange rates. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDINf BY THE COMMISSION: Application was filed for a rehearing of the above entitled case, directed against the opinion and order of the Commission dated March 29, 1920. A rehearing was allowed and has been held. The facts of the case are fully stated in the former opinion. The more important contentions urged by the applicant will be taken up in the same order as in the motion for rehearing. The Commission found that the applicant claimed $85,519.66 as the reproduction cost of its property on October 1. 1919. That figure is taken from sub-exhibit 6 of applicant's exhibit 55. which sub - exhibit is a summary of the figures contained in the preceding five sub-exhibits. In sub-exhibit 6 the property is classified among eight primary accounts, viz.: real estate, buildings, central office equipment. :-.ub-6tations, distribution, tools and vehicles, stores and supplies, and general expenditures. The amount assignable to each account is set forth, the aggregate being $85,519.66 It shows in the exhibit that it is= based on the company's records. The applicant now claims a reproduc - tion cost on the date named of $111,026.96. The latter figure is not contained in the evidence but appears only in the brief of applicant. If is a computation based on a large part upon testimony of the applicant's secretary, most of which statements were made prior to the offer ot applicant's exhibit 5. The secretary's statements were general in their nature and did not, except in a few instance*, relate to specific item?, The sum first stated, $85,519.66, appears to have been based upon an examination of the books of the applicant, and was prepared by an ex - pert employed by the applicant. In view of the facts the figure given </seg>
            <seg id="p130">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 203 in ihe brief of applicant, based only upon general assert'on.i oE the secretary of the company, cannot be taken seriously. The difference between the two figures, both offered by the applicant as careful esti - mates, is $25,507.30. Such variation is sufficient to warn us that great reliance cannot be placed upon any of the figures otfered and that we should be guided rather by the physical valuation than by the records of the company. During the hearing counsel for '.he applicant repeatedly said that the figures offeredl were only estimates and might vary from the actual facts as much as $25,000. In the former opinion we found that $6,500 contribution to capital in 1907 was a duplication in that the amount had already been included 'U the income account, designated by applicant as "other," which in- nuded money borrowed from the banks for which Mr. Becker be - came surety and which he paid in 1907, taking stock in return. It is contended that the total amount of "other" receipts from the beginning ot the company's business to December 31, 1907, was but $4,997.20; that the most that could be claimed as a duplication was $2800. The conten - tion is without merit. It appears that about $2600 of the money was borrowed in 1898 and 1899 and $200 more in 1900, from local banks. Other sums were borrowed later, bringing the principal up to $4700 in 1905. The interest that accrued on notes was added to the principal when the notes were renewed. The evidence shows that more than $1500 in inter - est accrued upon the notes. It also appears that the company carried large overdrafts at the banks, upon which overdrafts ten per cent inter - est was paid and that that interest was also included in the notes as renewals were made and that the total of principal and interest reached the sum of $6500. It was stated in the former opinion that the accrued interest was included in the amount stated as having gone into capital. A careful re-examination of the record convinces us ofth e correctness &lt;&gt;L thai conclusion and that in addition to the interest upon the notes the interest paid upon overdrafts was also included. The opinion should have stated that the $6500 included not onlythe amount stated as "other" income but also included the accruals of interest as indicated above, and that when settlement was made with Mr. Becker he was given otock in the company for the entire amount. Applicant says that the Commission's statement of the amount of expenditures for operation, as shown in applicant's exhibit 2, up to 1908, is incorrect in that it is $100 too large. The criticism is justified as there is an error of $100 in the figures; due allowance for which will i;e made. Objection is made to the finding of the Commission that up to July 1, 1907, $11,700 for salary and for care of a team from 1898 to 1907 was paid to Mr. Becker. It is alleged that the sallary of Mr. Becker and he charge for the care of the team from January 1, 1902, to July l. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">204 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 1907, aggregating $9900, were for the most part not paid until 1916 and then without interest, and that one-half of this amount should not have been deducted from the receipts of the company for the period up to July 1, 1907. It is alleged that there is no evidence to justify the Com - mission's findings. The exhibits, however, prepared by representatives of the applicant show that in 1907 $9960.65 was paid out and was put in the column "other" disbursements. It is definitely shewn that Mr. Becker received at least a portion of this sum; the evidence really shows that he received pay of the entire amount owing to him at that time. The assertion that Mr. Becker's claim was not paid until 1916 is not tenable and is in direct conflict with the showing of disbursements in applicant's sub-exhibit 5. The total disbursements for the vear 1916 are given as $13,110.60. They are classified as follows: Construction Operation $ 607.04 3,027.47 2,072.71 1,710.20 Maintenance General Dividends "Other" 4,672.50 1.020.6S Trtal $13,110.6f&gt; None of these accounts could have contained the $9900, or any pan of it, except the account designated as "other" and as that was only $1020.68 it is obvious that Mr. Becker was noi paid in that year. We think that the Commission was justified in finding that the payment was made in 1907. We are also convinced that the total investment of the company down to 1907 did not exceed $26,063.86. as originally found. except as to the error of $100. mentioned above. Applicant alleges that this figure on investment in MOT is proven erroneous by the class of property in existence and the number of sta - tions then in the exchange. The Commission does not say the property had not ccst more in 1907 than the above figure. Depreciation reserves accrued in the nine per cent figure used by the Commission, and not realized in fact, which makes up a larger part of the cumulated nine per cent, were, of course, borrowed by the company from the fund to which they belonged, and were used in construction. The total con - struction cost wculd in this case be the investment plus the depreciation funds used in new construction. Complaint is made because nine per cent of the average amount invested in the property was set aside, for maintenance and depreciation. Applicant asked that that allowance be reduced to eight per cent for the two items. Applicant urges that the system was especially well - built and that during its early years required very little expenditure for repairs. We readily grant that a well-constructed system would not re - quire repairs immediately, but to say that depreciation is not taking </seg>
            <seg id="p132">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 place from the time the property is constructed is to deny all exper - ience. Depreciation in value results from the deterioration of the property due to ape and use and is not dependent upon the time at which repairs are made except that the longer repairs are deferred the more rapidly property deteriorates. We do net think that the allowance should be reduced. Criticism is made Of the figures used in illustration by the Commis - s-'on as to the amount of the investment as shown by applicant's ex - hibits. The illustration was not correct in that both receipts and ex - penditures were understated. The total receipts for the period June 30, 1907, to January 1. 1919. were $160,264.47, according to applicant's ex - hibits. From that amount there should be subtracted $632.63, leav - ing $159,631.84 to be accounted for. The deduction of $632.63 is for "miscellaneous earnings", which were derived from the sale of prop - erty and were not really earnings at all. The property consisted of poles and other material sold for the most part to telephone companies in nearby towns. To include the amount as additional income would be simply to duplicate the figures. The expenses for the period, as shown by applicant's exhibits, were as follows: Total $128,365.16 The item of general expense should be apportioned between main - tenance and construction, but as nearly one-half of the construction took place prior to 190S and as the heaviest construction thereafter took place in 1908 and 1909 the general expense should be charged much more largely to operation than to construction. At least three-fourths should be charged to operation. By so doing we have total expenses, except for construction, of $122,566.72. Deducting the total expenses from the total income leaves a balance of $37,065.12 as the largest amount that could have been applied to construction during the period speci - fied | That sum is probably too large as more than three-fourths of the general expenses were attributable to operation. It will, therefore, be seen that the Commission's original illustration was not far from the correct result: in fact, it favored the applicant. The applicant vigorously complains that the property is too greatly depreciated by the engineering department of the Commission. We have gone over the evidence and have considered each item complained of. We think the valuation of a few items should be increased as fol - lows: Operation Maintenance leneral dividends â flthor" # 28,372.7: 23,193.7 37,605.5' 10,588.9 </seg>
            <seg id="p133">206 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Carbolenium 22.40 Total $451.85 The evidence is not clear as to some of the items, but the preponder - ance seems to be in favor of the applicant. The Commission's original opinion gave consideration to the tact that prices generally had in - creased. Further examination of the record inclines us to think that the additional allowance was not sufficiently large, particularly with regard to the distribution ijilnit I'pon a consideration of all the Tacts the Commission finds that $2000 should be added to the increase allowed under the former opinion dup to increased prices. Complaint is made by applicant that there was no allowance for working capital. The point is well taken; allowance should be made for that purpose! The records show that the company had at the time Of the inventory I including omitted property) nearly $3300 worth of physical property in the form of material and supplies. This repre - sents a part of the working capital. The business done by the company amounts to about $20,000 per year Collections should be promptly made and the company should not allow its subscribers to fall into ar - rears. It should not require as much as the amount received from one month's business to .supply a sufficient working capital in addition to that invested in material and supplies. Fifteen hundred dolalrs will be added for working capital. The records show that applicant company expects too great an accrual of rentals and that it is losing too much money by way of uncollectible revenue. We are not willing to allow a larger amount for working capital and thereby encourage lack of dili - gence in making collections. Applicant must keep its rentals collected promptly. One further item which must be allowed is "going concern value." It was not fully considered by the Commission in the original opinion. It is impossible to measure it accurately, yet its existence is recog - nized by the highest authorities and it must be regarded as an element of value. A considerable portion was allowed indirectly under the former opinion as it was included in the physical valuation, which was the value of much of the property in place and in actual operation. Two thousand dollars represents the Commission's best judgment as to the amount that should be added to that already included under the former opinion.

This gives a total of $61,209.21 as the fair value oi the property upon which to compute earnings. All claims of the applicant for more than this must be rejected. The additional value of $6042.00 will require something over $400 per year in revenue to be added to the estimate under the former opinion. Il seems to the Commission that no further increase should be made in the rate ai this time, but that the applicant should endeavor to re - duce its expenses sufficiently to cover the additional amount. Some of the items of expense appear to be rather large and perhaps a suffic - ient reduction can be made in tbem so that the necessity of adding to the rates will be obviated. It is also expected that the falling prices of materials and supplies will assist in this. At least no addition will be made at the present time; or until we ha^ve had opportunity to consider the 1821 report. ORDER. IT IS THKREORE COSIDERED AND ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that dividends be paid by the applicant on a valuation of $61,219.56 at eight per cent (8^) per year, and dividends are hereby expressly limited to said amount.

TAYLOR, Chairman This is an application by the Cortland Telephone company for au - (hority to incerease its switching rate from thirty-five cents per station per month to fifty cents per station per month. The company performs switch - ing service for about fifty farmers who are served on two lines. Effective February 1. 1920, the Commission authorized a slight increase in the ex - change rates of this company, but at that time no increase was made in the switching rate. The company is composed almost wholly of farmer stockholders and is operated as a community enterprise. Even after the increase in rates granted by the Commission it has found it some - what difficult to maintain the property, pay operating expenses and any return on the money invested. As stated, the switching rate is now thirty-five cents per month. This is below the standard rate for such service. Figures submitted by the company, giving in detail its operating expenses, show that the direct out-of-pooket cost per subscriber for switching service exceeds forty cents. This is without taxes on the property involved, any inter - est or return on the same, and does not include stationery, and print - ing expenses, salaries of officers, office supplies and expenses, and any portion of the general expense.

BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for consideration upon petition said to liave been signed by fifteen thousand people of the fity of Omaha, asking to have the matter of skip-stop operation by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railwap company discontinued and the former practice of stop - ping at each street intersection re-established. The first Order authorizing the installation of the skip-stop was ntered October 8, 1918. It was a war measure distinctly and had he support Of the City authorities oi Omaha. It was a temporary order nd upon its expiration the Commission held a hearing at Omaha to in - estigate the advisability of continuing the skip-stop for an indefinit* - uture period. The testimony there presented was practically all fav - rabie to the skip-stop and by order entered September 19, 1919, the com - tany was authorized to continue the use oC the system. The present phase of the case is in the nature of an investigation by the Commission on its own motion, such investigation resulting from the petitions filed by car-riders and others asking for it. For conven - ience it has been docketed under the application number of the previous hearing, Application No. 3910. Hearing in this case was held in the council chamber at Omaha On line 21 Of this year, with an evening session for the purpose of givinp pportunity to be heard to those whose duties made it impoossible tO ppear in the daytime. The investigation was carried on by the Com - mission, with help from City Commissioner Dan Butler, who was not an exponent of the Skip stop. Fifteen citizens and patrons of the ompany testified, all of them opposed to the continuation of the skip-stop save one. So far as could be ascenained, all of the witnesses appeared without solicitation and offered their testimony in their own way. Nine </seg>
            <seg id="p138">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 211 of the witnesses lived on car lines and most of these in close proximity to an intersection where cars under the skip-stop operation paused only once in each round trip. Aii analysis of the testimony of the complaining witnesses might be summed up by savins that part of the opposition to the skip-stop is based on the extra block necessary to walk and part of it on dangers incurred at night in walking the extra distance because of possible pre - valence of footpads and holdups on Omaha darkened streets. Two wit - nesses evinced no other interest than chronic hostility and an idea that through the skip-stop operation the company Is violating inherent rights of patrons and thereby escaping an obligation which the witnesses thought they should not escape. In his opening statement the general manager of the street rail - way, speaking tor the company, stated that the company would take no ;&gt;osition in the matter than to urge that sufficient revenues be provided to give the class of service demanded by the public and approved by the Commission as reasonable. Witness admitted there were unpleasant ieatures to the skip-stop which would be eliminated by its abolition, but it was urged that if the skip-stop were removed it would add to the expense irf operation. During the progress of the hearing questions of the company indicated its belief that there are many more arguments in favor of the skip-stop than against it. in considering the matter the Commission has carefully weighed the advantages and disadvantages of the skip-stop operation, the ex - rent of its use at the present time by the Omaha company, the attitude of the public, the financial situation of the company and the effect on that financial situation of the skip-stop. It is impossible in this in - stance to separate the question of service from the question of revenue* and' expenses. The main advantages of the skip-stop operation, as they appe;ir in the record, may be summarized under these heads: (a) Increased speed of operation and quicker journeys from outlying districts to the business section of the city, and vice versa. This is not as important as it appears as the element of time saved is not great. Tests indicated that the average speed of cars when using the modified skip-stop is 9.98 miles per hour as against 9.85 miles per hour without the skip-stop. (b) Comfort in riding. Riders on street cars will recognize this element, the sudden stops and starts of cars not being particularly pleasant, especially when the cars are crowded and people are standing in the aisles. The fewer the stops the less the number of unpleasant results of experiments of motormen in testing the full power of brakes and the capacity of the motor to get the car under way in the least pos - sible time. </seg>
            <seg id="p139">212 FOURTEENTH A.NXIAL REPORT (c) Saving in current used. It requires about as much current lo tart a street car as to keep it running for a distance of three blocks. Each stop eliminated, therefore, provides a saving in current and con - equently a saving in the consumption of coal. Fuel cost is the second argest item in the operation of street railways. It is impossible to scertain accurately the amount of saving in fuel, but carefultests made ndicate it is, for the Omaha company, approximately $25,000 per year when coal is worth $4.75 per ton. Coal is now higher in price than that. (d) Saving in wages of trainmen. This saving comes about through the more rapid operation of cars and the ability to maintain the same headway on heavy lines with fewer cars because of the quicker round trip schedule with the skip-stop. This can be fairly readily measured. Under present wages scales the saving in cars operated and the eonsequenct- Ihereof in kages of trainmen is about $40,000 per year. (el Apparent reduction in the number of accidents. This reduc - tion is for the most part the elimination of suc-h accidents as occur to persons while boarding cars. These accidents usually occur to the last person getting on, due to the car starting too soon. With the elimina - tion of thirty per cent of the total number of stops tlu&gt; chances lor such accidents are reduced. (f) Reducing congestion in traffic. The present method of operat - ing the skip-stop calls for regular intersection stops throughout the bus - iness district, and therefore, in the most congested territory. Hence, elim - ination Of congestion by reason of the skip-stop is not so apparent as would be the case if the company used the skip stop in the down town section, as is the case in some other cities. However, there is evideno that seme advantages in the outlying district occur from the fact that ordinances require that automobiles not pass a car while leading or un - lioding passengers. 1'nder the skip stop there is better opportunity for automobiles to pass the street car and get away during its two-block journey than would be the case where stops occur each block. The chief disadvantages appearing from the testimony are sum marized as follows: (a) Loss Of traffic. The concern of all street railways is the com - petition by privately owned automobiles, and particularly that portion of such competition as results in picking up prospective street car Ens by automobile owners, thereby depriving the street railway of ue. This friendly aid to pedestrians by automobile drivers must Sarily increase as opportunities are multiplied. The farther each prospective street car rider has to walk before boarding a car the greater the chance that he will be picked up by a passing motor vehicle. (b) Inconvenience of additional distance walked. All street car </seg>
            <seg id="p140">NEBRASKA STATK RAILWAY COMMISSION 213 riders in the zone at the skip stop, saving only the exceptions to the rule of skip-stop which exist in the city of Omaha, are required to walk one extra block on each round trip to the city. There is a certain ele - ment of irritation in the skip-stop in reaching the street car line, at an intersection where the car dees not stop, in time to have boarded at that point but too late to catch the car at the next intersection. These instances lodge in the mind of the irritated patron and probably magnify "ith contemplation. It in not easy to reconcile this with real criticism of the skip-stop. No doubt the patrons who miss cars because of the Kkip-stop missed just as many cars when the stops were made at each intersection, but in those latter cases only blamed themselves. At the time of the hearing in this case respondent street railway company was Tailing something short of earning operating expenses, taxes and bond interest. This poor financial situation was brought about by a curtailment in volume of traffic, due entirely to the in - dustrial depression. Since the date of the hearing the company has asked for an increase in rates of fares, which has been denied by the Commission, and the company has been urged to reduce operating costs. In so reducing operating costs the company has reduced the wages of a large proportion of its men. The financial situation is thereby improved. The volume of traffic is slightly improved as the industrial depression becomes less acute. It is. however, not yet cer - tain that the company will earn its preferred stock dividends under present circumstances. Railway operatives have done their part in ac - cepting wages reductions without serious murmur. It only remains to ascertain whether there is sufficient justification for continuing the skip-^top either Ircm its natural advantages or because of the financial exigencies of the company. "We are not at all certain that the skip-stop in outlying sections is not an actual benefit to the street car riding public as a whole; not itt all certain that the advantages do not very materially outweigh the rlisadvangtages. But when the consideration of the advantages and dis - advantages of the modified skip-stop, as used in Omaha, is coupled with the consideration of the company's finances and the knowledge that the elimination of the skip-stop would add $50,000 at least to the oper - ating expenses and would make more acute the question of increased rates, we are constrained to find in favor of continuing the skip-stop.

In the matter of the application of the Antelope County Mutual Tele - phone company for authority to increase its exchange rates. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: Rates prescribed by the Commission on December 3. 1919, for a temporary period were renewed subsequently for a period ending No - vember 1, 1921. The new rates represented a slight increase over those in effect prior to the effective date of the original order. As related in previous reports the company was started as a mutual organization and for many years lacked an efficient Central manage - ment. The plant was in a deplorable condition and certain improvements were required by the Commission before increased rates were allowed. These improvements Were made, in part at least, and our understanding is that the service has been materially improved. The company has railed signally, however, in one requirement imposed by the Commission, viz.: the keeping of its accounts under the system prescribed by us. it is impossible, therefore, to determine accurately the company's pres - ent financial status. The annual report for 1920 showed that it had total operating revenue from all sources Of., with total operating expense of ..$6,756.65 6,936.96 leaving a deficit of ....* 180.31 ....$ 174.90 to which should be added taxes and accrued interest making the total deficit f 355.21 It is manifest that the present rates are not excessive and that they should be continued If the company is to improve its service and ite plant.

Suffi - cient money is being paid for collecting and bookkeeping at the present time to pay for a proper system of accounting. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the rates approved for the Antelope (.'runty Mutual Telephone company in the original order in this case be extended from November 1, 1921, to November 1, 1922, subject to the condition that within ninety days from the date of this order the company file a written statement, over the signature of its directors, to the effect that it will install and attempt to keep a system of accounting that meets with the requirements of the Commission.

In the matter of the application of the Platte Valley Telephone Com - pany for authority to increase rates. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner Informally there has been presented to the Commission the ques - tion of rates lor special service rendered by the Platte Valley Tele - phone company to some forty sugar beet dumps of the Great Western Sugar company, heretofore served in part by the applicant herein. Appli - cant has made a very careful study which leads it to the conclusion that it is entitled to a rate of $4~8.00 per annum for these business sta - tions on farm lines. The service is rendered for approximately three and one-half months each year, and applicant, for the protction of its property, finds it necessary to remove the telephone instruments after the period of service is over. </seg>

The matter has been given such careful consideration as the ur - ency of the situation permits, and it is the opinion of the Commission hat the present published farm line business rate should apply on these hones, and that because of readiness to serve, the Great Western Sugar ompany should pay the rate throughout each year. It is our tentative )inion that the special expedited service which the telephone com - any gives to the sugar company, will offset the lack of service at the witchboard during the period when the phones are not in use. These onclusions axe subject to review upon request of either the sugar ompany or the telephone company, in proceedings either formal or formal, at a time when they can be carefully considered. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Platte Valley Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized to apply a farm line business rate to those telephones supplied by it at the beet dumps operated by the Great Western Sugar company, said rate to be paid twelve months each year in such manner as will be satisfactory to both parties.

            <seg id="p144">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 217 OPINION AND FINDING ON REHEARING BROWNE, Commissioner Effective February 1. 1!I2(I. the Commission authorized this appli - cant to increase its rates from $1.50 per month for business service iind $1.00 per month for residence and farm line service to $1.65 for bus - iness service and $1.15 for residence and farm line service. In that proceeding no fair value of the property was found. After a study of the property the Commission's engineers found that its reproduction cost, on the basis of units actually experienced was $70,841.06 and that its condition per cent was such as to reduce this tigmn to a present worth of $$41,796.01. In its original order the Commission endeavored to trace the investment from the origin of the company in May, 1904, to date of the hearing. By locating the sales cf stock actually paid for and allowing unpaid dividends from year to year at seven per cent and assuming that they had been earned and had' gone back into the jiroperties, and also by charging against the company any dividends in excess of seven per cent in any year, due allowance also having been made for unpaid interest on these amounts, credit and debit, it was found that the stockholders' investment in the property amounted to $33,519.81. The order found that the property was not in proper service con - dition and that it was necessary to raise its condition per cent by investment of approximately $8000 additional money. It authorized : t iid directed the company to issue and sell $17,582.50. From the re - icipts of such sale $7,980.19 was to be expended in improvements and betterments and reconstruction and the remainder was to be paid as deferred dividends on the outstanding stock. The net result of the older was to provide for an outstanding stock issue of $41,500, en which the order provided that seven per cent return might be earned and paid. From the evidence tile Commission projected the company's exper - ience through 1920 and found that its operating expense was in amount of $14,841.08. of which $7084 should have been expended for main - tenance and depreciation. Dividends were allowed at $2905 and no pro - vision was made for taxes, that item having been overlooked. The Commission estimated that the rates authorized, plus toll earnings, would produce $19,312 of revenue and that this would provide a small surplus after the dividends were paid The Commission over-estimated the earn - ings and under-estimated the expenses. The record in this case shows that enough money was earned to pay the dividends. They were not paid, nor was there cash on hand with which to pay them. This is explained in part by an increase in outstanding accounts and in a larger measure by the fact that thirteen months of earnings were creditel to the year. When proper corrections have been made it is found that lhe net profit, out of which partial dividends might have been pair, </seg>
            <seg id="p145">218 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL, REPORT amounted to $1S13.6T. The company was not able to finance the sales of securities. People in the territory apparently have not the necessary faith in the stability of the company and its ability to pay regular dividends, this attitude no doubt resulting from the irregular manner in which it has paid dividends. The Commission recommended the securing of a manager to have general control of the properties and a more vigorous policy of administration. These recommendations have not been carried out by the company, the excuse being that the increases in rates were so sma'l as to make improved service impossible. In the original order the history of the development of the com l.any was traced and it was pointed out that the capital had beconv spread too thin over the large plant, it amounting to approximately %'l&gt; per Station, or only about fifty per cent more than the value of the instruments and drops alone. The failure to keep pace with the growth of the plant by sales of securities made it necessary for the company to borrow its depreciation reserve lor extensions and to allow its orig - inal properties to depreciate to an unusnal degree. It is the firm d-- sire of the company to rehabilitate its plant from the revenues. In tV original order the Commission said this could not be done, that con - clusion being in keeping with the regular finding of the C'um::iiss : &lt; n There is no other manner in which to rehabilitate these properties except through the sales of additional securities, either additional -took or bonds or notes. In its application for a rehearing the company asked authority to issue and sell notes, but at the time of the hearing it developed that its main purpose was merely to register warrants issued 10 pay for improve - ments and allow such warrants to draw interest until they could be paid out of the revenues. Such a plan cannot be approved. It has for its object doing the very thing which the Commission warned against, viz.: the rehabilitation of properties out of increased revenues, thereby in - creasing the stockholders' equity in the property at the expense of the subscribers. There can be no question that this property requires innm-diat â¢ attention. Such attention was given to it in 1920 as was made pos - sible by the use of the dividend earnings, but a program so meager does not meet the requirements. Failure to pay dividends in 1920 in - tensifies the company's inability to float its securities, the thing which it is seeking to avoid. The need for additional capital is so imperative that we will in this order endeavor to point the way. Active participa - tion in the program on the part of the board of directors is absolutely essential and the order will provide that unless this attention can be given participation on the part of the Commission in solving the prob - lem will not be continued. At the time of the rehearing the board of directors indicated its desire to take an active interest and to change </seg>
            <seg id="p146">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 the property from a depreciated, indifferently managed concern to an up-to-date vigorous commercial institution. With that attitude we are in full sympathy. Testimony at the rehearing was that the adjustments made in the original order held out no promise which would induce others to ven - ture their money and that the handling of the question of rair value of the property left the impression that additional monies invested would not be properly recognized, thereby still further discouraging the im - 1 rovements. The following elements are before us in the testimony in the two hearings, from which conclusions may be reached as to the fair value of the property: Reproclucticn cost, based on original experience of unit values $70,841.06 Inasmuch as a fair value was not found, no cosideration was given H) any other than the sacrifice of the stockholders. No reference was made to present cost of reproduction, nor to going value, nor to working capital. It is obvious to us that if this company is to be put on its feet a 1 -' an active commercial corporation a fair value must be found and proper action taken to recognize such lair value. It is also clear that too much stress cannot be placed upon the as - sumed sacrifice of the stockholders. The engineer found, property which cost $70,000, and when due allowance had been made for the use of de - preciation funds in extensions he found the present value, based on orig - inal cost units $41,796. It is perfectly obvious that the difference be - tween this figure and the total amount put in by stockholders and div - dends thereon had to come from some place. This is a company of 1200 subscribers and approximately 325 stockholders, most of whom are farm owners. It is an established fact from scores of investigations made hy the Commission that much service in construction is donated in this kind ot a company. The- demand for service in the early part of this (entury was very strong and most independent companies we-re unable to finance a.s rapidly as interests required. To promote their enjoyment of telephone service, various individuals, stockholders or not, volunteered labor aid. Officers likewise donated services. The officers in this com - pany have always furnished service, the value of which considerably exceeded the pay received. There is no way of ascertaining the result* accomplished from such donations other than to measure them by the results in visible property. This visible property may also include sur - j.luses earned and reinvested over ami above a fair rate of divided Present worth, based on the units mentioned 41.796.01: â¦ Investment in stock and of dividends earned but not paid at seven per cent, simple interest $33,519.81 </seg>
            <seg id="p147">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 220 earned and not paid. At any event the property is there, and ihe court* hold that great weight must be given to this fact in arriving at a fair valuation fcr basis of rate making. In finding a fair value of this property we will consider it as it is. give due weight to the manner of its origin and costs during the period of major construction, give proper credit to the fact that outside of certain highly stimulated values, due to the world war, there had been for twenty years prior to the war an upward trend to average prices of those things necessary in the construction cf a telephone plant, take into account that it is a well-situated system, in a prosperous community, economically administered and from all these facts reach a conclusion. That conclusion is that the Cair value of the property for a rate base is $49,0(10. On that value the company is entitled lo a fair return. MANAGEMENT OK PROPERTIES. The plant is economically but not properly managed. It consists of one metallic exchange in the county seat of Nelson and four much smaller outlying exchanges, with metallic trunk lines between any and all of them and free service to all subscribers throughout the system's area. The system comprises SM metallic service stations and 850 grounded line stations. The exchange at Nelson operates iwenty-four hours in the day. Except for the farm lines, the service is Ullllv metallic The exchanges at Ruskin. Oak and Angus are metallic in -own and grounded in the country. Nora is fully grounded. At the four outly - ing towns, service is rendered fifteen hours in the day. At Nedson five operati rs are employed on a two-position switchboard, two operators working at a time during the heavy load periods. At each of the four other exchanges one operator is hired, who in turn, must sunply what additional help is required. House rent is furnished free, but the oper - ators must furnish light and heat. The scale of wages paid operators is well below the average scale found necessary In the state. This is par - ticularly true cf the four smaller exchanges, at three of which the oper - ator receives $40 per mouth and from that she must pay the additional help. There have been frequent changes of operators, probably due to the scale of wages paid. Service at the four outlying exchanges begins at six o'clock in the morning and ends at nine o"clock at night, and, with the exception of Ruskin, the exchanges are closed on Sunday from ten a. m. to two p. m. In our opinion, the needs of the subscribers require that the ex - change remain open an additional hour each day with no change in the middle-of-the-day closing period on Sunday. During the six summer months this hour should be added to the time of opening and 'luring tht&gt; etx v&gt; inter months added to the close of the telephone day. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 221 Two linemen, with headquarters in Nelson, are presumed to cover the territory. One of the linemen is supposed to handle all current trouble and the other, together with extra help, works on more extensive repairs. Because of the distance of some of the exchanges from the headquarters, a great deal of time of both linemen must be spent in traveling. It is the experience of the Commission that two linemen cannot properly keep these properties in sood operating condition and that additional money Mould bf spent for this purpose. The cm pan y has a very excellent secretary, who looks after most the complaints, takes care of the books, does a large measure of the â¢cllecting and acts as general manager after a fashion. He is paid a â alary entirely incommensurate, with the duties he is presumed to i&gt;er - orm and even were he paid a more liberal stipend he does not have he necessary time to properly perform his duties. In the original order rein the company was urged to provide a manager, with proper powers take charge of the entire physical property and to relieve the secre- avy of all other than the office work. This has not been dene, the ''"-son given being that the company was too hard pressed ?inanciall&gt; Tl The company will be expected to select a manager to have charge ot the physical plant. This manager can devote part of his time to supervision and management and part of his time to actual participation in the program of repairs and replacements. His selection will give the company the equivalent of two and one-half linemen as experience has shown that the management will not require more than one-half of a ;ipa,ble man's time When ib.c company lias extended the time during which elephone service is rendered to subscribers by one hcur each day, it will make all the more imperative that such compensation be paid operators as will insure more continuity of service and insure also that attention to their duties which can only be demanded when properly paid for. The rates to be provided is this order have been figured on the assumption that additional expenditures for these purposes will be necessary and will be money well spent from the subscribers' point of view. Following are the estimated expenditures for 1&amp;21. although they will be possibly ex - perienced only for the last eight months of the year: Maintenunce. normal replacements ol plant ill', on *?2.641&gt; $8,000 Total maintenance and depreciation Traffic: Operators (estimated on additional time required and additional compensation) 5,800 Other traffic expense 100 Total traffic Commercial expense: C'.erks and officers $1,800 $5.90'J </seg>

We come new to the question i:f financing the reconstruction pro- gram. As we have already said, most of this money must come from sources aside from revenues, either from the sale of stock or from the sale of bonds or notes. It must be clear that if this company were to spend |10,090 in a reconstruction program its properties at the end of 'he program period would be worth at least several thousand dollars more than the fair value denoted in this order. If such money were to be secured mini the revenues and the company were thereafter to sell its properties, it could secure pay which, in turn, would be distributed o the stockholders only, for several thousand dollars of property which has been built from revenues not intended for such purposes. Hence, insistence on [he part of the Commission for a financing program. We have found that ;lie value of this property for earning purposes is 149,090. The present outstanding stock is approximately $24,000. The company, prior to its sale of other securies, is entitled to have repre- sented in outstanding stock a proper amount of the value of its properties. It will, however, not be wise to issue stock to the full fair value. Much </seg>
            <seg id="p151">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 224 f this property is in thirty per cent condition. It will soon have to be eplaced. In the replacement program a certain amount of the prop - rty will be lost. The depreciation reserves are invested in these other (roperties and in turn will be lost in the reconstruction program. Hence, lere must be a margin of safety uncapitalized but still a part of the fair alue in order to take care of these unknown losses which are bound to occur and in order to add such financial stability as comes from the xistence of a surplus over and above outstanding obligations. We think the company should be authorized to issue one share of tock for each share of stock now outstanding upon the condition that he owner of a share of stock pay into the treasury the amount of $6.00. hich shall represent the difference between the par value of a share f stock and the amount of earnings now invested in the property on hich a stockholder is to receive a slock dividend. As soon as the tock is issued under this plan it is entitled to earn and to have paid he full eight per cent return. Until it is issued by reason of the pay - ment of the marginal difference it is to be held in the treasury and UCh earnings as shall accrue on such stock shall be disposed of as shall &gt;e legally decided upon by the boi:rd of directors. By this plan, if it is successfully prosecuted, the company will re - eive more than $5,000 of additional capital, which is ut this time sorely eeded. It will have outstanding at the conclusion of this financing 48,000 in stock. It will have net assets of $49,000. plus $5,TiM) and minus - uch unavoidable loss as comes in the replacement program. There will till remain, therefore, in the properties a fair margin of surplus to pro - ect the investment. The company is to understand that as any of this ew capital is invested the fair value of the property, which, will be hown by the books, will increase correspondingly ;md it will he allowed o earn Its regular return on all such increase. The company may, if the board of directors so desires, submit to the Commission a plan for still further financing through the issue of notes. bearing such rate of return as will attract the investor. These notes mp.v have whatever period is deeme-J advisable, but it must be understood hat they are not to be paid off out of the revenues of the company, tut rather through refunding into bonds or through sales of stock when he market for stock has been assured by the increased confidence of he public.

            <seg id="p154">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 227 rates chiefly because the Commission desired to keep in touch with the development of a reconstruction program which called for certain re- EBeaadng. One of the conditions of the original order on rehearing \&gt;as that the company might issue certain stock dividends in lieu of deferred dividends invested in the plant but that each share of stock paid out as a dividend should require from the owner of the equity in the share $6.iw in cash to complete the transaction. Tile records of the company as of September SO. 1921, show that the outstanding capital has been increased by flu, 340.00 which increase could only take place coincident with the receipt of cash as new capital. The recordB indicate that the money received from the sale of securities has bees and is being used for the betterment of the properties, par - ticularly rehabilitation. It is apparent that the company is *naking an effort to increase the amount of capital through the sale of stock for cash in order that the properties may be rehabilitated into first-class kinu condition. With the earnestness of that effort we do not com- Miiin The record for live months, frcm Hay 1 to September 30, indicates the company has used practically all the maintenance and depre- iation reserve earned during that period. This Indicates a lehabilita - ion program to a certain degree from current revenues. Traffic ex- penses have been slightly less than the Commission estimated was nee - i ssary. The company has not yet hired a manager, in anticipation of which an allowance was made in figuring necessary expenditures of |7$.0O per month. This money is accumulating. The net result of live months operation under these temporary rates shows that the company has not deferred any maintenance currently ac- uins: that it lias earned Us dividends and passed tc surplus approxim - ely $ 1 2 r&gt; per month. Frcm much investigation we know that this company is operat - ng with high economy. If there can be any criticism at all it is that economy has been allowed to interfere to a certain degree with excel - lence ol service. There is nothing in the shewing for the five months which warrants any other conclusicn than that the present rate scale .'â hall be continned. However, through practices which grew up during the development of the system of applicant, has come a general impression that rehabili - tation extensions are properly to be paid for from revenues. It has be'en rather difficult tc get the officers of the company to see that such a program continued may be unfair to subscribers. No serious damage, if :;ny. has been done to the subscribers thus far, but the Com - mission has carefully attempted to guard against an improvement pro - gram to be made out of any other revenues than new capital and poe- </seg>

As a result of this agitation and the threat to establish a competing com- pany, two, of the three large stockholders sold their interests in the com - pany to an organization composed of farmers and business men in and about Gibbon. Transfer of the management to the new organization Â«a.Â« made about August 1. 1920. A farmer patron of the company was made manager. This management continued for a period of five months, dur - ing which time the accounts and records ol the company were very im - properly kept. Heavy expenditures for new materials were made and a considerable amount ol money borrowed at local banks to pay lor the same. The affairs of the company got \j\ such shape towards the first of December, that a change became necessary.

It is not improbable that areful management throughout the year would have permitted the com- jany t&lt; pay its dividends and left a slight surplus besides. The Com- BSion is convinced that the present management is keenly desirous rehabilitating the properties and giving the territory served first class elephone service. We have no disposition to discourage them in this ittempt. Ready money is imperative, if this is to be done. It should &gt;e understood, &lt; f course, that depreciation reserves which may have been (tmulated in the past and used to build new properties, can only be .:&gt;: &lt;-d through the sale of securities and such is the method approved the Commission for reconstructing properties.

Chairman: Increased rates approved by this Commsision under date of March 192ii. and etefctive under that order until November 1, 1920, and &gt;sequently continued in effect until November 1, 1921, now require attention because of the near approach of the termination date of the last onier.

However, the record as to the revenues and expenses has been accurately kept and the results of the application of the existing rates are thus ascertainable. The com - pany operates two exchanges, one at Ord and the other at BurweU. A portion of the reports combine the revenues and expenses from both exchanges, but since May the figures for Ord alone are available and are presented as follows: REVENUES City subscribers' service revenue $5,071.00 farm subscribers' service revenue ...

In the original order the Commission required the company set aside $4,457.00 annually for maintenance and d&lt; preciation. This amount has been exceeded during the past eighteen months with the result that there has been no opportunity for creating a reserve. As staU in the original order, it was impossible to determine at that time, and the information is now lacking, as to the cost of the consolidated prop- erty now in place. That fact cannot be ascertained without :i revalua tion of the property. In the meantime it is in the interest of the public that a liberal expenditure be made by the company in reconstructing Â»he plant. The management should bear in mind in this connection that it is not intended to make additions and betterments to the property out of earnings and due care should be taken with the accounts so that this result can be avoided.

The immediate ' cause for ihe filing of the application was a complaint registered by the Oilead Telephone company, to the effect that the maintenance of this free exchange of service with Reynolds is detrimental to the former company for the </seg>

The e\idence as to a contract is not clear. biBding effect of such a contract, if one existed, would superior jurisdiction ol this Commission. Certain Reynolds company appeared to protest against lance of i he free service, but it is significant that their ry largely on the-ir desire to secure such connection without mselves. For example, one witness testified that he uses Fairbury several times per day on business connected with point or with county officials. It seems clear to the r traffic of this nature should not be carried by the â s. when its cost must be spread over other patrons who nefit from the connection. The same situation is illus- ii case of a merchant residing at the village of Thompson, ween Reynolds and Kairbury. and who is a subscriber of l\\ linpany. He testified that he found it necessary to call houses iii Fairbury daily and that this line is neces - hat purpose. He could by the same token, argue that Thompson t &gt; Lincoln should be submitted to his since he has occasion to call the wholesale houses n Ljncoln also. Seme of the farmers objected to the elimination of he free service on the ground that the farm lines of the Fairbury and 01 the Reynolds exchange approach each other and 11 hat the exaction of a message charge from farmers ia this midway when they desired to talk from one exchange to the other, would zone 5;e burdensome and discriminatory. There is force to this objection, but it is an objection that can be lodged by farmers residing midway between any two exchanges in the state of Nebraska. There must be a dividing line between exchanges, although in this particular case It appears from the record that there will be less inconvenience than usual. </seg>
            <seg id="p169">242 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Commission is cognizant of the complaint of the Uilead Tele - phone company, the same having been lodged with our department. It is manifest that that company is put to a disadvantage in not having a free connection with Fairbury, as does Reynolds, particularly in view of the free exchange between Oilead and Reynolds. In other â â¢â¢-ords a subscriber of the Gileau company living between Gilead and Reynolds, can transfer from the former to the latter exchange, continue to pay the same rate, but by the transfer secure not only Reynolds and Gilead service, as he did before, but in addition get connection with the 1700 subscribers on the Fairbury exchange. There are a mini ber of smaller towns in Jefferson county which hare telephone ex - changes, but none of them can reach Fairbury without the payment Of toll charges. This record does not disclose any reason for making an exception in favor of Reynolds. It sometimes happens that condi - tions exist justifying a free exchange between two systems, hut do such situation is disclosed in this case. It might be stated in this con - nection that the evils of so-called "free interchange of service" have become manifest with experience and the Bnvereal tendency Han been to discontinue such arrangements as rapidly as possible. The Com mission, therefore, finds the present free interchange of service between Reynolds and Fairbury to be discriminatory and the application for its discontinuance will be approved. OHDKK IT IS THEREFORE ORDKREU that the Lincoln Telephone Ac Telt grah company be and the same hereby is. authorized and directed t discontinue the free service between its exchange at Fairbury and tli exchange of the Reynolds Telephone company at Reynolds, Nebraska the same to become effective February 1. 1921.

            <seg id="p170">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 243 SUPPLEMENTAL. ORDER. 9R0WNE. Commissioner .On April 30, 1920, the Commission entered an order, effective May 1920. authorising applicant herein to increase its rates at all of Its exchanges in Hamilton county and adjacent counties twenty-five cents per month. These rates were to remain in effect throughout the period 1920 and were to be subject to review at termination. The results of operating under the increased rates were carefully scrutinized by the Commission from time to time in reports filed by the company in ac - cordance with the uniform accounting rules of the Commission and were found to justify an extension of time to July 1, 1921. The company &lt;w appears and asks for authority to continue its present scale of tes ttmmghcut the remainder of the year 1921 and sets forth in a upport of iis application a summary of its earnings and disbursements nil its other active operations for the first four months of 1921. These four months period of 1921 may be summarized as fol OWS Expenses may be subdivided as follows: Maintenance and replacements $ 5,874.26 In spite of the fact that in December the company was authorized to set apart for maintenance and depreciation an increased amount of its revenues, it will be noted it has accrued entirely an insufficient amount lor unrealized depreciation even at the higher rate. This is explained by the company on the ground that it has had some serious storm dam - ages this past spring, necessitating an undue expenditure in that period. It is not fair to measure the sufficiency of the maintenance allowance by such unusual conditions. The Commission is still of the opinion that an ample amount is being set aside. There is no evidence yet of reduced wages expenditures for this company. It was very reluctant to increase its wages scale and had some labor troubles in consequence.

This is a company officered entirely by farmers and its stockholders are almost all farmers. It is not unreasonable to antici pate that at the earliest equitable moment the company will make ('ownward readjustment in its wages scale. There hare been some lowered costs of materials which will reflect in lowered maintenance - costs. But the particular materials most needed by telephone com - panies have been rather tardy in feeling the downward trend. In the original order herein the ("omission directed that the com - pany should not expend for new construction more than $.ti)00 per an - num out of operating revenues until it had presented to the Commission sufficient reasons why it should be allowed to expend more. The com - pany does not pay dividends but does rebate to its stockholders iwen tv-five cents per month, in return tor which the stockholder owns his own instrument, buys his own batteries, and keeps the instrument and drop wire in repair. It was our judgment in the original case that this twenty-five cents rebate did not compensate the stockholder fully for his investment when it was considered that he was required to ex- pend a considerable amount each year which the non-siockholder sub scriber did not expend. The two thousand dollars referred to above was in the nature of an additional dividend. The company was limited in it - expenditures for new construction out of operating revenues becausi of the early necessity of replacements and the need for accrued funds with which to do the replacing. In keeping with this requirement of tht Commission, which was concurred in by the board of directors, ar rangements were made for the sale of preferred stock as necessary foi improvements and betterments. Conditions of the original order, at modified in the first supplemental order, wi â onti plemental order. Telephone companies in Nebraska were held to ra .i creases in gross revenues as compared with pre-war revenues and ut - terly failed to accrue any surplus against which they might draw in periods of financial depressions. This, however, cannot be overlooked in considering possible reductions in gross revenues. The experience of this company today is no different than the experience of all other companies in the state. The apparent profit of $1,772.71 for four months requires some modification. It includes book earnings of twenty-five cents per month additional on all those who did not pay in advance before the end of the first month of the quarter. Since the rural subscribers could secure the reduced or net rate after April 30, if payment were made by a cer.ain time, a portion of these increased earnings would automatically be written off and would thereby reduce the apparent profit of $1,772.71 by a considerable amount. Even with such a reduction the com- </seg>

In the same way a small surplus was turned in lÂ»2o. In neither instance was this amount suffi - it'in td Justify a reduction in the rate although such surpluses will be onsidered when the Commission does undertake an investigation for mrposes of possible rate reductions. The present rate structure will be ontinued with full assurance that the company will keep careful watch n its expenditures and at the earliest equitable moment will make re - lictions in expenditures which will warrant reductions in the ratp ORDER.

            <seg id="p173">246 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER. BROWNE, Commissioner This matter came on for hearing before the Commission in its of - fices by reason of the fact that the temporary rates under which it is operating expire by limitation on the 31st inst. The original advances granted this company of twenty-five cents per month for all classes of ex - change service were effective May 1, 1920. It has from time to time been permitted to extend those higher rates and asks in this instance that it be given another extension for the period of 1922. The orders in this case have never been bottomed upon compre - hensive effort to ascertain fair return on a fair value. The company is peculiarly organized in that all farmer subscribers are stockholders and in that its articles of incorporation do not permit dividends. It does, however, make certain rebates to stockholders, which rebates ithe original order we found did not compensate for the cost and vestment of each individual stockholder. We therefore permitted the mpany as a minimum consideration to spend $2000 per year from I revenues in any manner it saw lit or as an additional return to the ockholders, if so desired, over and above the rebate allowance. We e no reason to change this conclusion, pending a careful survey ot the property. The company's book cost as oi October 31, 1921, is $12 276,12 for fixed property, against which it has set up a depreciation i serve of $18,361.10. We do not pass, and have not passed, on the a curacy of these figures and do not find it necessary under the c: cumstances. For the first ten months of 1921 the company's linanci situation for the year may be summarized as follows: Total operating revenues $42,782 Expenditures: Maintenance and replacements $14,268.91 Reserve for depreciation 731.09 Traffic expenses 13,454.63 Commercial expense 8,300. 03 Total operating expenses $36,754.66 Operating income $6,027.87 Deductions for taxes and interest 1,305.00 Profit and loss $4,722.87 Revenues: City subscribers service Farm subscribers service Switching revenues Toll revenues All other revenues $24,709.22 14,787.63 200.00 2,567.57 618.12 </seg>
            <seg id="p174">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 247 From this must be taken five-tenths of the $2000 found as the minimum equity in the original order herein. Testimony of the secretary is thai what with discounts for prompt kholders additional return. As lias been heretofore stated in other findings, this company oper - ates with high economy. Its board of directors is made up of farmers and no extravagance is apparently permitted. Its overhead and gen - erals Office expenses are relatively low. It is apparent that the com- i surplus of $3200. aproximatply, after having set apart the |2000 as a payment and federal income taxes the year will find the company with pany could at this time -reduce its rates aprpoximately ten cents per â¢ ttbscrtber per month. The manager desires to wait until the full ad- nee granted in May, 1920, could be removed. The president of the ompany is inclined to favor removing a portion of the advance at thÂ« arliest moment. Because the rales are relatively low for this company the Commis - sion is inclined to let this be a matter of corporate judgment. Under ligher rates for almost two years there has been earned as a sur- us about $700O. l T nder the terms of the original order this is avail - lie as a cushion fund to draw asainst if the first reduction does not leave sufficient revenue to meet necessary exepnses. It is, however, practically all tied up in slow accounts. We invited the attention of the company to the advisability at the arliest safe moment to make some reductions. President Snider promised to lay the matter before the board of directors. In the mean - time it appears equitable and proper to grant a further extension of time of six months at the present rates, with the probability that at the ex - riration of three months, the company will be in a position to make some reductions. In the first supplemental order we authorized the company to in- crease its maintenance and reserve account to $1S,00 per annum. The showing for the first ten months of 1921 does not indicate that this is . xci ssive. although on a percentage basis it is high. All such funds reflect immediately in a higher grade of service. We believe it proper, however, that in the light of possible reductionsin wages and materials the company may be able to reduce this amount in the near future. We wlH, in this order, require a set-up of only $15,000, but will not interfere with the larger amount if the judgment of the board of directors so runs At the hearing in this supplemental application some consideration was given to the level of wages which are not shown to be relatively high.

Langdon. attorney for Papillion Commercial Club, OPINION AND ORDER. BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing before the Commission in its of - fices at Lincoln September 15, 1920, application theretofore having been made for authority to remrve the two blocks of interurban trackage within the village of Papillion. The village authorities and commercial interests of Papillion appeared in protest against the proposed removal. Applicant owns an interurban railway, one terminus of which is at South Omaha, from which point to Omaha trackage agreement exists hetween applicant and the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company: the ether terminus being within the village of Papillion. The railway has been in its present location for ten or twelve years. As denoted by the name of the company, the original intention was to build more extensively and to run the line through the city of Papillion rather than to terminate at that pcint. At the present time, the tracks of applicant in Papillion occupy a portion of Washington street between Sixth street, which is the town boundary, and a station on Fourth street, with a wye occupying a 8mall j.crtion of Fifth street. The right to occupy this street was granted by </seg>
            <seg id="p185">258 the city in an ordinance known as Ordinance No. 121, passed and ap - proved September 4, 1908. KThe immediate rea.-on for the application was the passage on Sep - mber 13, 1920, of an ordinance by the village board of trustees direct - ing applicant to remove its present trackage to the middle of Wash - ington street and to pave "he portion of the street within its rails and for c-ne foot outside cf each rail, said paving to be done in conjunc - tion with and at the same time as the paving of the street, applicant to pay all costs of removing its property to the center of the street and of the designated portion of the paving. At the present time the rails cf the electric company are so located that one rail would be within the proposed paving and one within the park space. Applicant and the village council considered various propositions, the company urging a grant ol permission to move its trackage a few feet further into the park space, thereby avoiding the expense of paving. The vil - lage insisted that the track should be in the middle at the street and that the romps: ny shoul 1 pave one portion. A condition of the paving ordinance was that if the street railway company were required to pave t certain portion of the middle of the street the paving would be de that much wider so that whether the street railway company pave a portion of the Btreet or not the cost of the paving would be the same to adjacent property. At the time of the heaving the company alleged that the ntal cost it under the ordinance would be $8,718.50. of which the paving it - elf wou'd amount to $3 ISO. To avoid this expense, it asked to with - raw its terminus Horn the present location en Fourth street to Sixth reet and there to insta'l Itfl wye just outside the village limits and o remove Ma station !) &gt; jldinfr to that point. It was admitted that a âºart of the expense which it would have to pay if it complied with the rdinance would be met by it even under its remrval program. On hi li-ilf f the city it was urged that it was equitable for the company to pave portion of the street and that it would be highly inconvenient to he citizens of Papillion, patrons cf applicant electric railway, to have the station removed any farther from the center of the village than its present location. There is no question but what the Commission lias jurisdiction over matters involved in this application. A common carrier, having by its action indicated a territory which it proposes to serve and having given servke in that territory, must secure authority from this Commission befcre it can abandon any part of the territory covered by its physical property. kHerpolshe : mer Co. v. The Lincoln Traction Co.. 96 Neb. 154. Commission has nothing whatever to do with paving the public &gt;fs of the village of Papillion or the assessment of the cost thereof. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">259 If it denies the right to abandon the trackage within the village of Papil - lion the city can proceed v/ith the enforcement of its ordinance unless restrained by court action. Our jurisdiction rests wholly with the question whether the applicant shall continue to occupy Washington street within the village of Papillion. We have not passed on this case earlier because at the close of the hearing it was indicated that applicant and protestants would attempt to get together on an equitable basis and because at various times since the hearing we have been informed that progress had been made in that direction and a stipulation of dismissal would be filed. Xo results have been accomplished. It is common practice for ciies of Nebraska, being served by eicc - distance outside of the rails at the expense of the transpor - tation company. This requirement has the approval of statute. as wi-'I as cf ordinance. H dates back to the time when street cars were hauled by horses and theoretically, at least, there was serious dam age to paving in consequence. It was continued after the date of elec trie railway service on the theory that a valuable right within the city had been granted; that the franchise was a thing on which the com pany earned larse returns; and that the city was merely relieving it self of i ert:iin expenses in return for the privilege granted to the transportation company. The situation is now quite different. By regu lation within Nebraska nc value is given to franchise rights and no elec trie transportation company is permitted to earn on any such franchise value. These carriers are limited as to returns and can make no profits except a fair return upon b fair value of* the property. They are per mitted to capitalize the cost of paving, to earn a fair return thereon and to set aside out ol gross revenues a sufficient amount for maintenance and ultimately for replacing of pavement. These amounts the public which rides the electric vehicle are required to pay in the rate charged for transportation. Obviously, the paving is of no moment to the rider within the electric car and he enjoys no benefits from it. Yet, iniuer- this practice, he is required to pay an expense which other ivise \vi uld be borne by the adjacent property owner or by the village itaetf, an expense for an improvement which is advantageous solely to the adjacent property owner and to those who use the streets In oilier manner than by riding in the electric transportation car. Under existing conditions this is. in the opinion of the Commission, highly in equitable to those whr must travel 1n the less luxurious manner pro - vided by the electric trolley company. Were it practicable to impose this additional burden caused by the proposed expense 'ipon the citizens! of Papillion who ride ffhe interurban cars. it â "/ould still be unjust because they would not be the persons bene - fited. In general the cost of paving is assessed on the basis of the bene - fits derived. Paving burdens imposed by cities upon electric railway companies in effect are taxes levied upon the riders and not in accor - dance with the rule un:iev which other paving taxes are levied. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">260 Added emphasis is aiven to the argument by the fact that the properties are not being operated at a reasonable profit. In eight months of 1920 the net revenue for interest and dividends was only (T4.19 and for the s;;me period of 1919 was $2087.46. The property estment carried on the books of the company, exclusive of electric tribution equipment, is J17S.712.30. This amount has not been proved the Commission. The company also showed that on a typical day idied. September 29, 1920, the Papillion business was carried at a net s of $9:82, without consideration of fixed charges and return. The nimission will not, where it has the right to prevent, be a party io the imposition of this burden upon an electric transportaton company and indirectly thereby upon those trolley. Only with reluctance dot with the workings ol municipal such government. It is, hcwever transportation by common carrier the rights of the transportation who, perforce, must travel by electric s it in any way attempt to interfere government and the police powers of imposed with the duty of providing at the minimum rate consistent with company and it is not justified in overlooking: that duty even though it may be required to run counter to the desires of the municipal authorities within the limits o* municipal - ities. No definite assurance has yet been given by the village tliat this niinance will be emended. It has not been repealed "or modified. It s understood that verbally the village has signified its \Â« -illinirness to re - cve the company of this burden, but on thai assurance the company s not justified in going to the expense of moving its trackage to he middle of the street and possibly thereafter either W pay pavinp BB - essments cr to remove its tracks to the village limits. It should not be equired to enter into any expense until the matter is thoroughly adjud! tted as between the village and the applicant. We do not arxee with applicant that it should not he required to meet any expense as a result .of proposed Improvements, but should ;-â â¢ permitted to retire to the village limits to avoid all possible expeBBo. ertain expenses, keeping pace with public improvements, are inevitable ocommon carriers although they are not revenue producing improve - ments. The expense which the company would be to in moving its rackage to the middle of the street and putting in new ties and pos - ibly substituting paving rails for the existing rails is an expense to vhich it cannot be heard to object. It is incidental merely to the im - rcvcment undertaken by the public of Papillion and represents re - placements which must ultimately be made in any event and represents added value to its property, essential to its public service. We will not authorize the removal of the trackage within the village of Papillion except as an alternative in the event that the village does not modify its existing ordinance known as Ordinance No. 165. the ordinance which imposes the paving requirement upon applicant.

This matter came on to bs heard on the applicant's petition for authority to issue and sell its common stock in the amount of $10,000.00 at par, to provide funds tor additions and betterments. The application was amended at the hearing to include the outstanding stock in the amrunt of $11,800.00 which was illegally issued and sold when the cor - poration was organized in 1917, for the reason that authority from this Commission was net secured. a3 provided by law. Therefore the appli - cation, as it now stands before the Commission, is a petition for author - ity to issue stock in the amount of $21,600.00 par value. The record shows that the citizens of Lewellen subscribed and paid for the first issue of stock at par in July. 1917, in payment cf the property installed at that time. The increasing demand for service required additions to the prop - erty and changes in the plant, which have been estimated to cost approxi - mately $10,000.00. Applicant has submitted an inventory and appraisement of its exist - ing physical property, which has been checked by the Commission's engineering: department and found to be substantially correct and in accord with the outstanding stock. Applicant has also submitted an esti - mate of the cost of its proposed additions and betterments, which hare been checked with satisfactory results. Tlu' record shows that the annual gross receipts of the applicant for current sold, based on the month of November. 1920, are approximately J5472.00 and the annual operating expenses are $3156.00. The applicant's operating expenses include an electrician and bookkeeper at approxi - mately $1,500.00 per year. This sum also includes the cost of the labor lor current maintenance but does not include accrued depreciation. The applicant will have additional revenue when the propesed additions and betterments are Installed, vvhich were not included in the above receipts. The Commission finds that the issuance of the securities as prayed </seg>
            <seg id="p191">264 for in the applicant's amended petition, is reasonably required for the purpose of the corporation, as provided by law, and should be allowed. The Commission also finds that the applicant's issue of common stock in the amount of $11,600.00 was illegal and it will require that the appli - cant call in and cancel this issue and issue new stock in lieu thereof, as provided in this order. The Commission also finds that the applicant will set aside a sum annually as a depreciation reserve fund before dividends to the stock holders arc declared and paid. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Blue Creek Ught &amp; Power ompany be and the same is hereby authorized to issue its common stock n the amount of $21,600.00 par value. Of this sum, stock in the amount f $11,600.00 shall be issued to the present stockholders, in lieu of the tock now outstanding, which has been illegally issued. The applicant authorized to issue and sell the remainder of this sum, or $10,000.00 t par, the prc reeds of the sale ot said stock to be used for the purpose t paying the cost of additions and betterments to the property, as set lit in the application. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petitioner be and the same is hereby directed to set aside out of its operating revenue, the sum o: $1200.00 annually, which shall he used for current maintenance and a* a depreciation reserve fund. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall on or before ninety days from date hereof furnish this Commission a sworn statement that said $11,600.00 unauthorized stock issue has been called in, destroyed and replaced out of the $21,600.00 stock issued under this order.

            <seg id="p192">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 APPLICATION NO. 4342 In the Matter of the Application of the Citizens Telephone Company of Malmo for Authority to Issue additional stock in the amount of $63377 SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman: Applicant prays for a modification of the original order in this case, asking that the amount of stock authorized be increased so as to cover ;it least the full depreciated value of its properties, as found by the engineers Of the Commission, in addition to the $5000 which it proposes put into extensions and betterments. A subsequent study of the valuation of the Commission's engineering department prompts applicant to offer some criticisms, which appear to he justified. The most important objection relates to the value of the ]â¢â¢ al estate at its exchange at Prague. The engineering department found i. value of $100 for the lot at that point and $900 for the building. Appli - cant states that it paid $600 for the lot in 1&amp;16. The building, which is ;i six room residence, cost on contract $1239. It seems only fair to allow applicant the full cost of these properties, particularly in view of the fact that the valuation of the engineers was made on the basis of orig - inal cost. This would, therefore, make a difference of $839 in this item. \pplk-ant also complains that the cost as applied to some of the other items or property is too low in view of the fact that they have been placed during the high price period. It is possible that there are a few items to which this criticism would apply, but the amount of such prop - erty would be so small as to but slightly affect the total. As stated, the value as found by the engineers was on the basis of the original cost of the property and dees not take into consideration increased prices prevailing during the war period, except as properties were actually constructed or put in place during that period. Upon further consideration of the matter the Commission is convinced that some consideration should be given to changing prices. To determine the permanent capital of the company, however, on the basis of the prices that have prevailed during the past five years, or that were effec - tive at the time the valuation in this case was made, would be to do vio - lence to the rights of the patrons of the company and in all probability to the company itself. Prices of materials have already begun to recede and it is to be reasonably expected that they will decline very sub - stantially during the next few years. To fix a value at the present time therefore, on present costs would inevitably result in the company having capital outstanding in the future far in excess of the value of its property The present depreciated value on the original cost basis was found by our engineers to be $57,619. If to this we add the correction in the </seg>
            <seg id="p193">266 real estate item at Prague of $839 we would have a total of $58,458. The Commission is of the opinion thai that figure may very safely be used for a basis for the issue of stock at this time, the $5000 for extensions and betterments being in addition thereto. In the original order we limited the total issue cf new stock to $44,000, which added to the $13,000 of stock outstanding made a total issue of $57,000. Under the modification we have just discussed the total outstanding capital would amount to $63,458, which would require the approval of a total additional issue of |50,458. The figure of $63,458 would represent the value cf the property after the extensions and betterments are made, as proposed by appli - cant, if the value is considered from an original cost basis. As stated above, the value of the property at present prices is no doubt consider - ably in excess of this amount, but such excess should very propprly rep - resent a surplus of assets to be held uncapitalized as a protection to the outstanding stock and as a stabilizing influence on the property as a Because of the considerations discussed the Commission is of the opinion that the original order should be modified to the extent outlinptl ORDKR IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the first paragraph cf the orig - inal order in this case be modified and amended so as to provide for the authorization and approval of an issue of stock in the amount of $50,458. which would make the total outstanding authorized issue of stock $63,45S.

SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: Effective January 1, 1921, this company was authorized to increas* </seg>
            <seg id="p194">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY' COMMISSION 267 iates twenty-five cents per month on all classes of service, such rates to continue for a period of six months. On July 1, 1921, by supplemental order, it was authorized to continue these rates in effect until November 1 1921. Through its president, Henry Schwartz, the company now asks authority to reduce the rates on farm and residence service from $1.50 per month to $1.25 per month, effective at the termination of the exist - ing temporary order. At the time of the original order herein it was estimated by the Commission that the revenues would amount to slightly less than $7000 _&gt;er annum under the proposed rates and that the expenditures would be approximately the same amount if eight per cent dividends were paid on outstanding stock. There was no question but what the stock is fully represented by property. Coming at the time it did, when prices of farm products were falling sharply, the increase of twenty per cent in the rates resulted in some loss of revenue to the company through decreas - ing the number of rural subscribers. The estimate by the Commission of the possible gross revenue omitted the earnings from added ex - change service at Verdigre and at Creighton, amounting to about $400 I-er year. No allowance was made for loss of subscribers. We do not yet have the annual report of the company but it is evident that the actual gross earnings for 1921 will fall below the estimate made by the f'ommission. The company has perfected some economies. It has been able to reduce the salary of the lineman a small amount and to nearly eliminate rhe extra help on line work. The board of directors is fully aware that under the proposed reduction of approximately $1000 in revenues there is a strong possibility of earning none or only a small part of the dividends to which the company is entitled. Speaking for the stockholders, the board of directors is willing to sacrifice temporarily. The owners of public utility properties can voluntarily do what the Commission cannot under the law require them to do, that is, to waive the right to a fair return on their property. Whether this is an advisable thing to do is always a question, for where dividends are sacrificed when - ever an emergency arises it renders mere improbable the sale of addi - tional stock for betterments which may later be necessary. It is the opinion of the Commission that, all facts considered, this applicant should be allowed to reduce the rates on residence and rural service to $1.25 per month, payable in advance, and to $1.50 per month where not paid in advance. It is not deemed advisable, however, to elim - inate the requirements for maintenance. The life of the company is, in a measure, at stake and the property ought not to be sacrificed. The Com - mission will, therefore, require the company to set aside a definite amount for maintenance. Because of some economics perfected since the previous orders the maintenance amount will be reduced slightly and the company </seg>
            <seg id="p195">268 Sll be required to set aside $2400 per annum on a monthly basis of 00, out of which amount shall be paid that portion of the lineman's salary representing the time devoted to maintenance and reconstruction, cost of all batteries, automobile upkeep and operation and labor and ma - terial for repairs and replacements. If any surplus remains it shall be Kl to the credit of the account and must not be drawn upon to pay dends. (The annual meeting of this company occurs in June of each year, which time whatever dividend is to be paid, as earned during the pre - ling year, is declared. The company will be required, as a condition of s order, at some time prior to the annual meeting in June, 1922, to &gt;ort to the Commission a complete statement lor the fiscal year June 1. SI, to June 1, 1922, of all earnings and disbursements, on forms pro - led by the Commission, or, if that is impracticable, to report for eleven the twelve months, and shall present to the Commission the judgment the board of directors as to whether any dividend can be paid and no â idend shall be paid until after check the Commission shall have found was earned. tA condition of the original and first supplemental order in this case that the company should more vigorously endeavor to maintain it^ unts in accordance with the uniform rules of accounting and should make such reports as were required by the Commission. The penalty for failing to do this was the possibility of having the rate increase can - celled. The application of such penalty might indeed be drastic and the Commission has hesitated to inflict it. If. however, the company does not pursue a more vigorous attitude in the keeping of its accounts such action will be taken by the Commission as is provided by law for the en - forcement of its orders in that respect.

Williams, secretary and attorney. For protestants â Jackson &amp; Rice, attorneys. OPINION AND FINDING TALYOR, Chairman Applicant operates a telephone system consisting of four exchanges, viz.: Brunswick. Royal, Ewing and Orchard. In addition to the sub - scribers served by these exchanges it owns the lines and furnishes the service to a number of farmers tributary to Neligh, switching service being secured from the Northwestern Telephone company, of that place. At the time of the application it had 894 subscribers. The present rate* are as follows: Business $2.00 per month Residence 100 per month </seg>
            <seg id="p197">270 Farm 1.50 per month .50 per month .50 per month 1.50 per month Extension business sets Extension residence sets Two or more using one phone The application in substance is to increase all the main classes of â ervice fifty cents per month. The company was organized in 1903 and has had no change in rates since that time. It has outstanding $30,000 in common stock and on December 31, 1920. had borrowei money in the amount of $13,1)00 It has paid out dividends averaging eight per cent since fcl organization. In 1920, however, it was able to pay only six per cent and the manage - ment anticipated having to pass all dividends during 1921. The valua - tion made by the Commission's engineers shows an original cost of the property of $71,217.93 and a present or depreciated value of $45,348.99. The plant is of magneto construction with McClure common return in the towns and grounded lines in the country. It covers a large area with consequent long lines. This adds very materially to the cost of maintenance. The property is not in the best of condition and will re - quire very substantial repairs during the next two or three years if any - thing like adequate service is to be maintained. The company has two regular linemen, but desires to add a third in order to more promptly take care of trouble and make necessary repairs. In addition to these men it has employed during the summer months additional men and expects to be engaged in a reconstruction program for some time to come. The switchboard at Ewing is old and needs to be replaced. The property has been operated on a very economical basis. For example. the traffic cost per subscriber for the year 1920 was only $3.03 per year as against an average of S3 independent companies, whose records are before the Commission, of $5.15 per subscriber. The commercial ex - pense per subscriber for this company was $2.22 in 1920 as against an expense for the 83 companies of $4.19. It is obvious, therefore, that the company cannot expect to further reduce its direct operating costs. As a matter of fact if adequate service is to be furnished it is not unlikely that these costs should be increased. During 1920 the company ex - pended $10,209.03 for maintenance and replacements. This is consider - ably above the average for companies of this size. As we have indicated, Enrever, the character of the territory served and the area covered led for a maintenance cost somewhat above the average. We are of ! opinion, that an allowance of twelve per cent on the original cost of the property, as found by the engineers, would be sufficient. Basing the revenue on the number of subscribers now in service the results of operation are shown to be as follows: Sross revenue Expenses: i o. 3perators Commercial $2,709.85 1,980.40 </seg>
            <seg id="p198">271 Maintenance Taxes 8,546.04 291.99 Interest 991.62 Total $14,519.90 Net operating income _ $ 1,662.22 The interest charge, as shown above, will without doubt be larger during the next year since the company was compelled to borrow $3,600 during the latter part of last year, interest upon which is not reflected in. the above figure. The tax item will likewise be substantially larger in 1921 than it wa;; in 1920. Dividends at eight per cent on the $30,000 of capital stock amounted to $2,400. It appears, therefore, that the present revenues are not sufficient to pay the expenses and a return on the investment. The increases asked for by the company would produce added revenue in the amount of $5,382, per year. There appears to be no neces- sity fcr this amount of money. The company should have, however, more revenue if it is to continue to function and improve its service as It should. At the present time the residence rate of $1.00 per month is out of line somewhat with the other rates. This is true also of the business rate of $2.00 per month. An increase in these rates of twenty- five cents per month would produce added revenue of $1,123 per year j nd with slight readjustments in some of the other classes of rates. there should be sufficient revenue to tide the company over the present mergency and permit it to prosecute its reconstruction program. The manager of the company, Mr. Williams, stated at the hearing that he had offered to sell all or any part of the system, but had been unable to do so. He repeated his offer and stated he would be please. 1 to have the farmers and citizens in each community organize a company and take over the exchanges and that should they conclude to do so he would make the terms to suit the wishes of the purchasers. The peo- ple of the territory served, therefore, the option of gotag into the telephone business if they desire to do so and of going into It on very satisfactory terms. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Northern Antelope Tele- phone company be and the same hereby is authorized to charge and coV l"ct the following schedule of rates, effective December 1, 1921: Business $2.50 per month Residence - 1.50 per month Extension business sets .....â 75 per month Extension residence sets 50 per month Desk sets extra _ 15 per month Farm - 1.75 per month Vacation rates Vi regular rate </seg>

            <seg id="p200">-NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 273 able portion of which had already been definitely planned at the time of the hearing on this application In Application No. 4079, the Commission reviewed the financial his tory of this company and found that the stock outstanding at that time i March 26. 19201, in the amount of $51,782.00, represented an actual in - vestment in the property. Since that date the company has sold a small amount of stock for most of which it had had previous authority of the Commission but for $850.00 of which no authority had been granted. The total outstanding stock at the time of the hearing, on February 2, 1921, amounted to 153,712.00. Should the full amount of $16,000.00, as applied for. be issued the company would thus have outstanding $69. - 712.00. The engineering department of the Commission made a valuation of che property of this company as of October 16, 1919, and found the orig - inal cost ot the same to be $93,201.44 and the present, or depreciated value. to be $63,848.77. Since the date of that valuation the company has made additions and betterments to the property in the amount of $2.7iJ6.48 the details of -which are submitted in an exhibit in this record. It wm estimated, at the time of the hearing, that approximately $2,000.00 would be required in 1921 to make further extensions to the property. Appli - cations were then pending for new telephones, most of which were the farm lines. In this connection it should be stated that the company keeps ita books very accurately and according to the system prescribed by the Commission. It is fair to assume, therefore, that the record of expend - itures already made for additions and betterments is correct and can be accepted at face value. It can be assumed also that the estimate of $2,000.00 for further additions and betterments is reasonable and stock should be sold tor the same. This would leave slightly over $11,000.00 which applicant claims is required, at this time, for the purpose of re - plenishing the depreciation reserve. In support of this contention it shows that plans had already been completed and material ordered to rebuild the local distribution system of its exchange at Beemer. This it was estimated, would cost approximately $3,600.00. The remainder of the amount would be required to reconstruct and repair farm lines on both exchanges. These lines have been up for several years and, In keeping with the policy of this company to maintain its property in excel - lent condition, should now be overhauled and rebuilt. The Commission's engineers found the present value of this property In 1919 to be $63,848.00. A considerable portion of the difference between this $63,848.00 and the $93,201.00 may very properly be considered as the depreciation reserve accumulated out of earnings and at various times invested in the property. Naturally any money expended for improve - ment of the farm lines will bring up the present value of the property. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">274 In other words, if $11,000.00 were to be expended for this purpose the present value of the property should thus be in the neighborhood ol $74,000.00. To this should be added the $4,600.00 of additions and better - ments previously referred to. It is apparent, therefore, that when the proceeds of the $16,000.00 are expended in the manner outlined the present value of the physical plant will be very close to $80,000.00 ex - clusive of the free assets in the form of cash, bills payable, etc. The issuance cf the amount of stock, therefore, appears to be well within the value of the property and to be reasonably required by the company, and will be approved. Throughout most of its history this company lias paid dividends avei aging seven per cent. It is very desirous of continuing the pay - ment of dividends en this basis it it can be done and at the same time sell securities necessary for its further development. In view cf the iact, however, that securities in various other enterprises, bearing eight ]&gt;er cent, have been quite widely distributed in the community, it is feared that some difficulty may be encountered in trying to sell the seven per cent stock. The management, however, desires to make the attempt but asks that, where stock is sold by other than officers of the company, a commission of five per cent be allowed. The desire of the company to finance on a conservative basis is commendable. If it can sell seven per cent securities, with a payment of five per cent com - mission, that is to be preferred over the plan of increasing the dividend rate. However, it may be necessary, alter a trial, for the company to increase its dividend rate in order to properly finance its improvements. Should it succeed in disposing of the stock by the payment of a commis - sion, we are of the opinion that the selling expense thus incurred should be paid out of operating revenues, spread over a sufficient period so as not to be a burden in any one year. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Turning County Independent Telephone Company be and the same is hereby authorized to issue and sell for cash, or its equivalent, $16,000.00 of its common stock. Of this amount $4,800.00 shall be used to coyer the expenditures of a like amount lor additions and betterments to the property; the proceeds of the re - maining $11,200.00 shall be used to replenish the depreciation reserve fund of the company. klT IS FURTHER ORDERED that report shall be made to the Com - jsion of the sale of this stock and the disposition of the proceeds when 000.00, or any multiple thereof, has been sold.

APPLICATION NO. 4406 In the Matter of the Application of the Nebraska Telephone company et al. for Authority to make temporary surcharge for exchange serv - ice and to make certain changes in toll rates. FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: The original application passed on in part by us under date of Novem - ber 30, 1920, related in part to a *en per cent surcharge on exchange rates and in part to a modification of existing toll differentials. After being filed the case was broadened by the intervention of the Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph company, the Kearney Telephone company and the Platte Valley Telephone company, which desired to participate in the application and ruling thereon regarding toll differentials only. The Platte Valley Telephone company represented further that it has an inte.town rate of ten cents per message and that it had never applied for or received the authority to make any differential between station-to - station and person-to-person service. It desired upon this class of service to advance the person-to-person rates to fourteen cents per message and to leave the station-to-station rates at ten cents. In preparation for this application a study of a ten-day period on this short haul business was made, which showed that about sixty per cent of all intertown messages are now passing on the station-to-staiion basis-, although no revenue inducement exists to develop this class of service. It is apparently used because it is quicker. The company is in a rapidly developing territory and its toll circuits are becoming inadequate to handle its "peak" business. Either it must add other toll circuits or secure higher efficiency from its existing cireuii3. Our studies made a year ago indicated most conclusively a far greater efficiency can be secured from toll circuits by the station-to-station busi - ness and that the cost of person-to-person service would continue con - siderably higher than the station-to-station service. We committed our - selves to the principle of the differential at that time. There appears to be no reason why this company giving a high-class commercial service cannot be measured by the same principles that apply to the larger </seg>
            <seg id="p203">276 companies covering the state more completely. It already has the toll differential on messages terminating off its lines and also on messages where the minimum charge is more than ten cents.

For Lincoln Telephone &amp;â  Telegraph Co., Frank H. Woods, president SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Effective December 1. 1920. this Commission, in original proceed - ings on this application, authorized the Nebraska Telephone company to establish a temporary surcharge of ten per cent on all exchange service rates then on file with the Nebraska State Railway Commission and in effect and to apply said surcharge on any subsequent amended rates unless otherwise provided in specific orders. These rates were to re - n.ain in effect until the close of business June 30, 1921. unless sooner modified. Applicant's successor. Northwestern Bell Telephone company, has asked, in an amended application, for authority to continue the ten per (cm surcharge for a longer temporary period and also for authority to make adjustments in its toll rates, towit: To reduce the first zone haul to ten miles where it is twelve miles and to make similar adjustments in other rate zones: To increase the differential between person-tot-person calls and station-to-station calls from twenty-five per cent to forty per cent: and To similarly increase the differential on such special service as appointment calls and messenger calls. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company intervened to the ex - tent of asking that whatever action was taken by the Commission re - lative to adjusted tell rates apply equally to its territory, alleging need for the additional revenue and alleging further that so much of the business is inter-territorial in nature as to make it necessary that the toll rate schedule be uniform. In the original ordei in this proceeding the Commission made no findisg relative to that portion of the application which asked for an additional spread between person-to-person and station-to-station toll calls, reserving such consideration for a later date. No action was taken on that portion of the application between the date of finding and the present time, not because the company was financially proe- </seg>
            <seg id="p205">278 perous, but because it was hoped by the Commission that operating costs would so adjust themselves as to render possible reductions in rates by July 1, 1921. In the present proceeding the Commission will reserve for later consideration the question of amended toll rate schedules inasmuch as not the same emergency exists in that matter as in the exchange rate schedules, -which, unless acted upon at this time, will automatically lapse at the close of business June 30, 1921. tMany protests against the supplemental application wero lodged individuals, firms, corporations, civic and commercial bodies, all the general tenor that we are now in a period of financial depres - l and business stagnation in which private business is suffering lous diminution in profits and in many instances total lack of prof - its; that in such a period it is inequitable and unwise either to increase present charges or even to continue in effect the maximum rates here - tofore authorized. In main, the contention of the respondents was that when ordinary business is taking losses or is making little or no profits public utilities should step along in the same channel and endure losses or lack of profits in order to bear their fair share of the readjustments t going on between inflated war-time selling prices and essential ng prices in private business at the present time. In answer to these contentions it is only necessary to point to two facts 1. Practically all private business reached peak selling prices at least one hundred fifty per cent in excess of pre-war selling prices, this* high level apparently having been made necessary by the costs of doing business. Regulation did not permit any such increases in selling prices of what they had to offer to sell by such public utilities as appli - cant. The average increase in gross selling price permitted by this Commission to this company ou exchange service was, including the surcharge, only twenty-eight per cent. There is no such peak to coma down from as is the case in all private business of which we are aware. Carefully compiled reports by the federal bureau of labor at WashinK - ta indicate that the gross selling price of three hundred wholesale mmodities is at this time approximately one hundred fifty per cent above the pre-war average selling price, or considerably in excess of the present gross selling price of the service offered to the general public by applicant. 2. Because of the vital public nature of telephone business the state has undertaken to regulate the rates and charges. It was not permitted in a period of high prosperity, such as for the years 1915 to 1920 in - clusive was enjoyed by private business, to take such profits as the traffic would bear. In undertaking to regulate public utility enterprises </seg>
            <seg id="p206">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 279 the state is bound by very definite legal principles, chief among them being that, the utility shall at all times earn a fair return on a fair value of the property devoted to the public service, no more and no less. It is not within the province of this Commission to deny to a public utility a fair return on a fair value of its property if such business is being conducted in a businesslike and economical manner. Were the Com - mission to do so it would only invite the censure of the courts. We must now consider the experiences of applicant company during the period the surcharge has been in effect, viz., December 1, 1920, to June 30. 1921. The company was able to present in support of its appli - iation only its experiences from December 1, 1920, to June 1, 1921, and with these we will now ueal. - The financial experience of the company in 1920, which led the Commission to authorize a surcharge for a period of seven months, may be briefly set forth as follows: There was during the year 1920 outstanding $11,000,000 in stock, which represents the actual investment. The rate of return, therefore, earned on this stock, after interest was paid on indebtedness, was 3.66 per cent. The company paid seven per cent on the stock and to do it drew on its surplus an amount of $356,252.15, being about what was earned from the federal government on guaranty during the period of government control, 1918 and 1919. The expenses of the year 1920 in - creased very materially in the last half of the year, due to wages adjust - ments, which were not only necessary in this business but in almost all private business during that year. Were the statement only for the last six months of 1920 it would have shown a more serious situation for the company. As of January 1, 1921, the Nebraska Telephone company, applicant heretofore, was merged into a new corporation known as the North - western Bell Telephone company, which included the properties of the Northwestern Telephone company in Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota, the Iowa Telephone company and the Nebraska: Tele - phone company, which latter had something less than $1,000,000 of property in southwestern South Dakota.

            <seg id="p207">280 sary for financing purposes. Theretofore financing. for new construction had been bandied through the parent organization, the American Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph company, on demand notes, which up to the close of 1920 had not exceeded a six per cent rate. Money prices had changed sÂ»o much that it was no longer possible to finance tor six per cent or to finance on demand notes and a bond issue wasfloated for the purpose of funding the indebtedness of the new corporation, which indebtedness was the sum total indebtedness of the preceding corporations absorbed. These bonds bear seven per cent interest and were sold at such a dis - count as to cost the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, applicant herein, slightly more than eight per cent throughout the life of the bonds. Judging from the experience of private business and other sub - stantial public utilities this rate of interest was only such as the money market required. This Commission required the Northwestern Bell -Telephone com - pany to keep its revenues and expenses for its Nebraska properties separate and to file monthly reports cf such. These reports have ex - cluded the South Dakota properties. We have, therefore, in the testimony in this case monthly reports of the receipts and disbursements covering the Nebraska properties only and these are set forth in brief as follows: Net for Operating dividends Months Gross revenue expenses and interest January $ 360,867 $ 271.232 $ 57,075 Estimated per annum â 1921 : 14,404,276 $3,386,860 637.156 On December 31, just prior to the merging of the Nebraska telephone company into the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, cap - ital obligations outstanding were: Stock $11,000,000.00 7,856,625.43 Notes payable This capital covered Nebraska properties and properties in southwestern South Dakota. On proper proportion of these outstanding obligations to represent the Nebraska properties alone, conforming with the statement of earnings and expenses for the five months, the rate earned on the capital obligations was 3.58 per cent This earning, which is lower than the net earnings of 1920, is partly February March April May 349,819 . 378,205 364.764 . 371,442 B28a,fiOO 285,082 299,859 54.372 59.365 49.964 40,537 Total : .$1,825,097 11,412,024 $261,313 </seg>
            <seg id="p208">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 281 caused by continuation of high operating costs, from which the company suffered in the latter part of 1920 and from which it has receded very little as yet, and partly by falling off in toll business. This may be Uloa- I rated by the following tabulation: Increi se in exchange earnings is slightly less than the ten per cent sur - charge. (Iross toll earnings, as indicated, have suffered a decline. Respondents generally have asked that the surcharge, representing war-time rate level, be eliminated. This surcharge provides the com - pany in the neighborhood of $300,000 per annum. If 1t were eliminated without corresponding reduction in operating costs the net available in I921 for interest and dividends would not exceed $350,000 on the basis of tile earnings for the first five months. That amount of money would not p;;y Nebraska's propoition of interest on the bonds by close to $150,000 ;incl would leave nothing as dividends on stock, which represents actual original cost investment. It is obvicus at once that the surcharge can - not at tills time be eliminated unless some other answer is found than merely denying the company the right to earn on its outstanding obliga - tions. Roughly speaking, the Northwestern Bell Telephone company is expending for labor alcne lor the operation of its Nebraska properties $2,275,000. It manufactures none of the materials it uses and hence does not control the price which it must pay for such materials as service re - ouirements necessitate purchasing. The Commission made careful in - quiry at the time of the hearing as to the reasons why materials used in the telephone business were not reducing in price corresponding to average reductions in wholesale commodity prices. The answers were net satisfying, but it was evident that applicant had no control over these prices and the Commission is convinced that its purchases are being economically supervised. Applicant must, therefore, if the sur - &lt; harge is eliminated, either sacrifice all its stock earnings and a portion of its bonds earnings, thus inviting a receivership, or it must curtail on its labor ccsts. To curtail labor costs sufficiently that a fair return would remain for the investors and at the same time to eliminate the .-HircharRe would mean an average reduction in wages paid of between thirty-five and forty per cent.

As to how rapidly labor costs can be made to come down depends somewhat on how rapidly they went up and how high they went above the pre-war figure. Between 1916 and 1920 the total maintenance labor did not increase more than fifteen per cent, but this does not indicate that the average wages paid were E advanced more than fifteen per cent but rather that maintenance been curtailed. They were, however, advanced much less than average wages paid by private corporations. Traffic wages, for the most part paid to female operators, advanced between 1916 and 1918 one hundred sixty-two per cent, based on the per station cost. Opera - tors had before the war been paid unusually low wages and it is hardly possible to expect that during the present generation they will again reach that level. The company's labor in the commercial organization advanced in costs, measured by each telephone in service, about fifty - two per cent 'between 1916 and 1921. These considerations leave the Commission in no hesitation as to the action that must be taken relative to the surcharge. Its extension will be approved. Consideration of those portions of the application relating to amendments to toll schedules will be taken up in a further supplemental order during the month of July. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Northwestern Bell Tellephone company be and it hereby authorized, an emergency existing, to continue to charge and collect surcharge of ten per cent on all subscribers' service within the state of Vbraska, except as said surcharge may have been modified heretofore, r may hereafter be modified, by specific orders, until midnight Decem - &gt;er 31. 1921. unless sooner thereto other action is taken by the Commis - on, said extension of period of surcharge to terminate automatically on his date unless prior to said time of termination other action has-been aken by the Commission.

            <seg id="p211">284 SUPPLEMENTAL. OPINION AND FINDING. DRCWNE, Commissioner: The general rate cases of this applicant have been repeatedly be - fore the Commission since the latter part of 191S under separate applica - tion designations and in repeated considerations under the same applica - tion designations. In brief the Commission authorized the first increases to this company effective December 1, 191S, amounting to ten per cent hori - zontal advance. The crder was temporary in character although appli - cant had opposed such limitation and had asked for twenty per cent increase. Effective Juno 1. 1919, certain other increases were granted which were net horizontal in their nature. Previous increases were extended. This order was also temporary in its nature. During the same time certain changes were made in toll rates both by this Com - mission and by tile postmaster general while he was administering the telephone affairs of the nation. Hearings have been had from time to time since in all of which the results of the rate schedules have been carefully measured by the Commission and further temporary ex - tensions have been made. December 1. 1920. for a period of six months. the Commission authorized a horizontal increase of exchange rates cf ten per cent against the desire of the company which it denominated a surehi.rp:e and required that the company cany such increase on its bills as a separate item. In June, for reasons which appeared ade - quate, the surcharge was extended to December 31, 1921. The present hearing is by reason of the limitations on the surcharge fixed by the Commission at both the hearings. In November, 1920. and in June. 1921. the question of certain amendments to toll schedules was carefully Considered but conclusions have been held in abeyance by the Com - mission. These matters are still on its docket. This brief resume is lor the purpose of explaining why the rate schedules of this applicant have been so repeatedly before the Com - miSSion. It is recognized that the repeated hearings have a tendency to irritate the public by calling attention to the possibility of reductions in costs and all people now desire reductions in costs. It is unfortun - ate that irritation should be caused by the practice of this Commission in repeatedly bringing up the rate schedules for further consideration, especially when it should be known that such repeated considerations are entirely in the interests of the general public. In application filed December 16, applicant presents a new schedule of proposed rates which it desires to have approved for an indefinite period. It has grouped all the exchanges in the state into nine zones or groups with four additional groups in the Omaha local territory. The proposed rates have the effect in general of merging the surcharge into the regular rate with certain slight adjustments up and down in </seg>
            <seg id="p212">285 mcst territory and rather sharp adjustments at certain points. It ap - proved the proposed schedules would add to the revenue of the com - pany over what it is new collecting. Apparently anticipating objection to he schedules the comnanv has asked that If further hearine is essen- ie company has asked that if further hearing is essen- tial the surcharge be continued until the conclusion of the hearing. In support of its application the company presented evidence of the results of operations for eleven months of 1921 during all of which time the present surcharges were collected. These earnings included charges for service connections which have been amended in separate order of the Commission effective December 1, 1921. The amendments will reduce the company's revenues approximately $25,000. per annum. The company's financial report for eleven months shows a ui'i earning available for interest and dividends of $583,736.2S. The company lays claim to book value of pli.\sical plant averaging for the year l^^l $15,981,579.54. By simple process of arithmetic it is shown that the net earnings when applied to the average plant in service amount to 3.98 per cent From this net earning the company must be prepared to pay its share of the interest on $30,000,000. of seven per cent bonds which cover the property cf the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone CO!B{NUi; looted in the five states of Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota and a proportionate share of what- . â â /! &gt;r dividends can be paid on $72,000,000. of capital stock. The com - pany alleges that this is not a fair rate; alleges further that if no addi - tional increases in rates are provided it will fall far short of that riling which n is claimed the law intends that such utilities shall have. It is Farther claimed by applicant that its operations are economical: that the increase in the cross selling price of what it has to offer the public has been only thirty per cent over the pre-war selling price while the increase of its expenses have considerably exceeded this increase in rt venue and that it is entirely uncertain as to when these ex] enses can be reduced. The notices of the hearing, through no fault of the Commission. gave but little time to respondents to prepare concrete evidence. Such i situation is not fair to respondents but circumstances made it un - avoidable, the chief circumstance being the automatic terminating date of December 31, 1921, oJ the present rates. Hence, respondents had necessarily fj confine themselves largely to arguments. We will briefly state their various arguments presented. (A) Business is in a general state of depression, prices are fall - ing, wages are being reduced in private business and costs generally curtailed; that the farmers are tremendously depressed financially and must be given every possible advantage if they are to successfully weather the storm: and that the company should do what other business is doing, curtail costs, selling prices and take its place in the forefront at the effort to get back to normalcy. </seg>
            <seg id="p213">286 (B) That the schedules of rates as now being charged are made without a just regard for costs as between communities and that some communities are paying more than they should pay and thereby other communities are given the undue advantage of comparatively low rates. (C) That the company is extravagant, that it is paying too high wages, spending too much for officer's salaries, advertising needlessly, top heavy with overhead expenses; and that it is making no appreciable effort to fit its organization to Lhe necessities cf business conditions. t(D) That the present surcharge should be removed as a recogni - i of business conditions; that during the next few weeks the merits the main application which involve permanent rates by groups 11 be gone into thoroughly and such rates shall be made thereafter as all the facts shall warrant even though in making such later sched - u'.es the rates may again have to be raised if respondents do not estab - lish their contentions as to law, and allegations of fact concerning management are not proven. Considering now both the testimony of the company and the arguments of respondent: THE COMPANY'S CASE We present here briefly a comparative statement of earnings and expenses of applicant prewar and in each of the last two years, thes* comparisons being only summaries. The figures representing both rev enues and expenditures are per station in service per month; Year 19H 10 mo. 1920 10 mo. 1921 Exchange revenues $2.05 $2,423 $2.80 Toll revenues 73 1.110 -iÂ»7 Total revenues ! 2.821 3.495 3 790 The company had a surplus on June 30. 1914. of $1,615,091.68. This surplus had been created through twenty-five preceding years from all manner of sources including the rates and revenues paid by the public surplus invested in various ways and its earnings added to the general revenues. It is not capitalized and no dividends are paid to stock - holders en that surplus. This surplus belonged to the Nebraska prop - erty and certain property in South Dakota worth not to exceed a one - mteenth of the Nebraska properties. At the end of 1920 this surplus Maintenance expenses $ 95f&gt; $1,244 $1,256 Tiaffic expenses including operators .540 1.094 1.127 Pomme-.-c-ial expenses 244 .398 ',46 â General expenses including officers' salaries 087 .144 .133 Total expenses 1.S26 2.8S J.862 Taxes 148 .277 .239 </seg>
            <seg id="p214">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 287 had been reduced to $1,172,995.40. It had been called on almost every year because the earnings had not been sufficient to pay expenses and fixed charges and the seven per cent dividends on the stock. During 'hat period the federal government paid almost half a million dollars to this company for the privilege of the experiment of government operation of telephones. That money went into surplus and was drawn to meet deficits. By the end o!' 1921 the surplus for the property cred - ited to Nebraska will be still further depleted and will not exceed $1,000,000. As has been stated, this is invested for the benefit of the public and cannot readiiy be converted into funds to pay operating ex - penses or dividends. Slating it rnly briefly it is quite possible that the showing made by the company as to its net return available for dividends can be sub - jei-ted to some criticism. Before the absorption of the Nebraska Tele - phone company into the Northwestern Bell Telephone company a year ago there existed in the assets of the Nebraska Telephone company .-lightly 'ess than a milion and u quarter dollars of property in South Dakota. There were also earning assets that were not telephone prop - erties exceeding four and one-half million dollars. These assets are .-till earning presumably for the Northwestern Bell Telephone company and the fact that their earnings were to a large degree heretofore cred - ited to Nebraska properties ought not, it seems to us, be lost sight of. On the other hand the company is now measuring its demand to pay iliviilnuls on a rate base averaged through 1921 of slightly less than $16,000,000. or considerably less than the liabilities before the consoli- dation. The interest and dividend liabilities against the Nebraska prop - arttes prior to the consolidation were approximately $17,640,000. If these factors are to be considered, and if it is proper to consider them the actual return on the plant in service in the year 1921 will be about live per cent. These suggestions may not survive such close scrutiny as will be made of them by the Commission, representatives of the public and by the company at the time of the main hearing soon to be held. They are here presented merely in comparing the year 1921 with preceding years which applicant did not do. The suggestions obviously ignore the question whether the book value of plant in service as used by t^ e company in its computations is a proper basis for measuring the rate level. ARGUMENTS OF RESPONDENTS. (A) Arguments were presented by respondents to the effect that a public utility cannot run counter to general business conditions but must in a period of declining prices and consequent depression recognize such fact even though in such recognition it shall suffer loss </seg>
            <seg id="p215">288 either in rate or in property. This is comparatively new doctrine. It was presented in the case of National Live Stock Shippers League et al. vs. The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad company et al (No. 63 I. C. C. 116) and forcibly argued. The Interstate Commerce Commission said: "The answer is that the foundations of what is just and reas- onable are not set on such shifting sands." It was again presented in the case of freight rate levels on grain. grain products, and hay before the Interstate Commerce Commission last summer (64 I. C. C.) This fact was mentioned by respondents as show - ing that the Interstate Commerce Commission had measured the neces - sity for rate reduction by the economic conditions of the growers of grain and hay. If the parallel were to be exact it would include that the telephone rates for private business which still sells at a consider - able advance over prewar prices should receive another increase in telephone rates; that farm subscribers should be seriously interfered with in continuing their business by reascn of the telephone rate: that the extent of the telephone business had been considerably curtailed by reason of the level of the charges; and that extravagant operations of ihe utility had been freely established or confessed. This argument was used as a basis by the Railroad Commission of North Dakota in denyinjr a rate increase to this same applicant in the state of North Dakota only four mcnths ago. The federal court intervened without much cere - mony and authorized the company to go ahead and charge such ratns as it might propose, restraining the state from interfering. It may be that there is precedent in law to sustain mentions of respondents in this respect. In the short time given them to prepare their objections to the application respondents did net have a chance to fully develop possibilities of law on their side. We have only mentioned certain situations to which we must not be blind in reach - ing our conclusions. No question exists in our minds that we cannot accept the proposition of law laid down by respondents without giving :t most careful consideration. The matter of economic conditions should have the most thoughtful attention of applicant. This utility can voluntarily do what the con - stitution prohibits the state from doing; it can agree to accept a loss due to economic conditions if such acceptance is a necessary thing but we have yet to know that the state has any such prerogative. Respon - dents must not lose sight of the fact that the activities of this Com - mission in representing the state are inclosed by a high fence built by legislative law and court decisions. Not wittingly will the Commis - sion do an illegal thing. It did not make either the constitution or the statutes but it is bound by them the same as all private individuals. (B) The question whether rates in one town or locality are high </seg>
            <seg id="p216">289 or low, as compared to others, both absolutely and with relation to necessary expenses, is one that requires very careful consideration. Respondents recognize this. The Commission has from time to time investigated levels of rates in different exchanges of this applicant, but never a state-wide investigation. Most Of the rates, up to the time that the war-time percentage increases were effected, had the ap - proval of legislative sanction, because they ante-dated the year 1907. Arrangements have been made in a preliminary way for full considera - tion to this objection. Respondents have formed a working committee lo represent different localities, which will call on the company for whatever data it desires. A conference between this committee and the company and a representative 01 the Commission has already been ar - ranged, to perfect plans for a very thorough hearing on all points li if li seem to be in doubt. I C &gt; On the. question ci' extravagance of operation and lack of a proper effort to economize in keeping with the conditions of the times, there was much probing by respondents at the time of the hear - ing. Respondents could present no evidence, perforce, as they neither had had the time to prepare such evidence nor the opportunity to gain it. This weakness is to be remedied under the arrangements already made. The Commission did present an exhibit which showed, in brief, that at exchanges north of the Platte, as compared with exchanges .-(Hith of the Platte, which appeared reasonably comparable, there was a very decided difference in expenses of operation. Wages levels at exchanges of this applicant were very considerably higher than those of the large company operating south of the Platte. Applicant, during the year 1921, has received revenues very substantially higher than those of the Lincoln Telehone &amp; Telegraph company, which, in part, is caused by the dominatii n of the Omaha exchange in the applicant's territory. The Commission excluded expenses of the Lincoln and Omaha acnes in comparing the expenditures of the two large companies, in order that, in its judgment, comparisons might be more accurate. When this is done, it is shown that the maintenance expense of the iipplicant in September and October of this year were 81.3 cents per monfh per station in service while those of its large contemporary -within the state were 52.3 cents. Likewise, traffic expenses, including opera - tors' wages of applicant were 79.9 cents per month, and those of the contemporary 53.5 cents. Commercial expenses, which include adver - tising, accounting and collecting, were 3S.8 cents per month for appli - cant, and 16.3 cents for the contemporary. The total operating ex - penses, excluding return en investment, were for applicant $2,334 per month per station and for the contemporary $1,456. It was admitted by the Commission's witness that applicant has more extensive and more lucrative toll properties than does the contemporary. The data presented by the Commission warrants careful analysis </seg>
            <seg id="p217">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 290 and investigation. Respondents urge that the Commission find that the applicant is extravagant and base its denial of a continuance cf the surcharge en that finding. It seems clear that this would be a hasty conclusion. Applicant has had no proper opportunity to rebut the evidence. The Commis - sion did not make comparison of applicant's management with that of any other industry in the same territory and disregards whether or not the etrict regulation of revenues of the contemporary by this Com - mission may not have required it to operate at costs below what ire justified. tit this company lias a right at all times to a fair return on a lair ue of. its property as it alleges, this right cannot be claimed unless the same time it can be shown by it at proper opportunity that it operating bcth economically and efficiently. Findings in that re - spect by the Commission must be made most carefully. It is entering into the details of management and unless such findings are well bot - tomed they cannot be sustained on review by the courts. tThe answers ol the company to the testimony of the Commission's ountants. which testimony was submitted for what it is worth, were rely generalizations, as were also their answers on this subject to questions of respondent*. The Commission announced that the com- pany would in the main case be against the charge of extra vaganct- expected to defend itself adequately (D) Seme respondents also urge that the Commission deny Etinuance of the surcharge during the period of investigation of all points raised by the Commission and by respondents, and until the .1 conclusion on the major application of this company; and that at the conclusion cf the main case it fix such rates as are reasonable re - gardless of whether they mean increases or not. This does not ap- Er to us to be wisely considered. Certainly, if the evidence is not very ing indeed at this time that if the surcharge is removed it will not in have to be put on, or any other increases be granted, it would be most unwise to make at this time a downward revision of rates lo be followed shortly by another upward revision. It aeems more advisable that this company set up a temporary ac - count into which the surcharge shall be placed so that in case it is finally determined that the surcharge was not essential daring the temporary period between January 1, 1922, and the date of final con - clusion, and such conclusion shall be sustained if appealed, the full amount of such surcharge shall be returned to them who shall have paid it. The company, as a condition cf this order, shall file written acceptance thereof with the Commission. It follows from all that has been said heretofore that the Ccmmis </seg>

It cannot be said at this moment just how long the main case will take to reach conclusions. Much will depend upcn the promptness of both the company and of respondents.

            <seg id="p219">292 rates and charges authorized by the Commission in order dated Decem - ber 4, 1920, effective December 5, 1920, and to continue in effect until July 1, 1921. unless socner thereto modification were made. This schedule of rates is briefly : Eight cents cash fare within the Lincoln zone tTen cents cash fare between certain outlying points and the city Lincoln and between certain suburban points; t Token fare four lor thirty cents within the Lincoln zcne and token â  plus two cents to the in which the ten cent cash fare is rged; Five cents for transportation cf school children kThis rate expires today by limitations of the order unless extended, e Commission has kept close check on the finances, the operating 'enues and expenditures of this company, during the temporary period above mentioned and there is no hesitation en the part of the Com - mission to continuation of the existing schedule. It is really â  case of life and death. tTho main problem of this company is net now one of steadily ad - icing costs of operation, but rather one of steadily decreasing volume traffic, a condition which is very widespread in street railway rrana - portation ever the I'nited States. The one exception of which we are aware is Southern Pacific ,ccast points where tourist traffic is heavy. The company has made drastic reductions in operating costs but in spite of this revenues have been so low that during, the period Of this emergency rate practically nothing has been earned above fixed charges. To illustrate the tendency the following tabulation is inserted: Eote: The figures for April are omitted because the monthly report as mislaid in the offices of the Commission. During the months of February, March and May, 1921. 2,350,513 revenue passengers were hauled as against 3,001,562 in the same months c.t 1920. This represents a less of 21.7 per cent in the volume of traffic. It is futile here to discuss the reasons for the falling off of traffic.

            <seg id="p220">293 part it may be due to the high level of the rate, but in our estimation much more of it is due to the industrial depression which has seriously curtailed volume of all kinds of business regardless of whether prices have remained high or have heavily slumped. Service requirements made it necessary that the frequency cf operat - ing cars be not seriously reduced. Hence, while traffic has fallen off so heavily, the number of car miles operated during February, March und May, 1921. was cnly 2.1 per cent less than the car miles of corres - ponding period in 1920. This reduction has practically all resulted from reduced service on Sundays when volume of traffic is but little more than fifty per cent of week day traffic. No fault can be found with the economy with which this company i; being operated. Wages in different departments, outside of those working on track and trolley maintenance, were reduced from $31,867.04 in May, 1920, to $21,361.37 in May, 1921, or a reduction of approximately one-third. This does not mean that average wages have been re - duced that much, but the company has been able by installing oil burners ii the pcwer house, by increasing the number of one-man street cars, ml by other efforts, to reduce the total number cf employes very ma- iirially. The saving in wages in March, 1921, as compared with March, l!i20, is not so marked as thÂ» efforts of the company along this line are increasingly effective. Fuel costs are still a problem. The price of coal has reduced prac - tically none at all when increased freight rates are considered. The company, has, however, by the use of fuel oil succeeded in cuttinp: the &lt; osts of fuel to some extent, as shown by this tabulation: " It will be seen that while fuel costs have been reducing during the months of 1921, they were, until May. higher than for corresponding months of 1920, saving only January of that year. Applicant will be authorized to continue to set aside eight per cent lier annum cf its depreciable property, based upon the figure arrived at in previous orders, plus additions and betterments thereafter installed, such increase in the maintenance allowance, however, to be subject to the provisions of the stipulation voluntarily offered by applicant at the hearing prior to the original order herein, said stipulation having been incorporated in that order.

APPLICATION NO. 443i In the Matter of the Application of the Union Telephone Company of Wausa for increase in rates. Appearances: For applicant â E. M. Morsman, Jr., a torney; J. E. Baggstrom, gen &gt;al manager For city of Bloomfield, W. E. Funk, attorney; For city of Wausa and certain farm lines, P. H. Peter- son, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant operates exchanges at Bloomfield. Wausa and Crofton, with short line toll properties between the towns. It serves 1510 of its own subscribers and switches 518 stations of independent ownership. At Bloomfield it serves 712 of its own subscribers and "3 switching sub - scribers. Its property is entirely metallic within the town of Bloom- </seg>
            <seg id="p222">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 field, having just been reconstructed with the best possible equipment. Its farm lines are grounded. At Wausa the company's properties are en - tirely confined to the town where it has 226 subscribers receiving grounded service. It switches for 370 stations. At Crofton it serves -166 stations of its own ownership and switches 125 independently owned at ions. The properties are entirely grounded. The rates to date have been $1.75 per month net for business service; $1.25 per month net for lesidence and farm line service; and 40c per month for switching service. With the exception of the switching service, which was increased from 25c to 40c in 1919, the rates have not been changed since the origin of the company eighteen years ago. This company originated in l!Â»02 and has had substantially the same ownership since that date. It has been most economically managed and, while its service has been grounded beyond the period when towns of equal vigor and prosperity have been changed to metallic service, it haa uiven good service of the class offered. During the years 1919 and 1920 the company was faced with an extensive rebuilding program at high expense. Its Blcomfield exchange had ro u-Ii.m! such a physical point as to render necessary heavy expenditures and it was deemed by the directors that, regardless of high material and labor costs, it would be a mistake to repair rather than to reconstruct. Hence, the company thoroughly rebuilt the Bloomfield properties, cabled the town, put in much underground construction, built an excellent central office property and installed a high-typo new switchboard. Constantly advancing cost of labor and materials made this improvement, plus certain improve - ments made at other exchanges, cost the company $34,000, which has all been financed under the supervision of the Commission. On December 31. 1920, the company showed total gross working assets of 1121,765.79, of which the gross fixed investment was set down as $104,839.26. This is subject to certain adjustment, which has not yet been made, due to the fact that during the first twelve years of the com - pany's existence it followed the practice of annually shrinking the assets representing depreciation rather than carrying the amount of the de - preciation as a liability offsetting certain assets. When corrections have been made to the sross assets statement it is quite probable that the original tost of fixed property will show as more than $120,000 and the total gross assets will approximately exceed $130,000 even after the bills receivable have been reduced to a normal amount. Applicant has out - standing common stock in amount of $75,000, which has the approval of the Commission. It has notes payable and accounts payable of about $18,000. The Commission has authorized the funding into bonds of $15,000 of this amount. It will be noted that there is a substantial amount of surplus in the pioperty not represented by capital obligations, which surplus stands with the full consent of the company as a protection to the investment and incidentally to the decided advantage of the sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p223">296 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT scribers. The $34,000, which was spent in the past eighteen months on improvements, does not all reflect in added assets to the property be- cause a considerable amount of property had to 'be retired from service. It is all represented in additional capital obligations "because the deprecia- tion reserve, which existed for the purpose of taking care of displaced property, was invested in additions and betterments and had to be re- leased by the issue of capital obligations in order that it might be used for the purpose for which created.

            <seg id="p225">298 FOURtEENTri ANNUAL REPORT Total estimated amount available for dividends 6,240.00 Dividends at eight per cent on outstanding stock 6,000.00 Possible surplus 240.00 Explanations on tabulation of expenses above: The company insists that it is necessary to have a total of fourteen per cent on the original cost of the depreciable properties for combined maintenance and depre - ciation in order to properly protect the properties. This exceeds the allowance the Commission has deemed sufficient and substantially ex - ceeds the experience of other companies so far as we know. The figure 113,500, set out in the estimate above, was on the approximate basis of eleven per cent. It was used merely in measuring the reasonableness &lt;/f the rate and does not require that the company confine itself to that figure. A higher amount may be set aside il available. Traffic ex - pense is based on the present experience of the company and consists i hiefly of operators' wages. These wages run from $50 to $65 per month. It is impossible to ascertain at this time when the cost of liv - ing will permit reductions in wages. The commercial expense approxi - mates the present experience. The amounts spent for clerk hire and managerial effort is in excess of average experience but may be worth all that is being paid. So long as economies can be effected at other points without danger to the service the Commission will not frown upon the cost of management Respondents made no protests as to the wages paid. The company cwns its central office property and the item of rents at $1200 is offset in the revenues, a total of which is set out above. In the deductions, taxes are shown at $275 more than the 1920 experience. This is done on account of more valuable properties having â been completed during the year 1920 which will reflect in the taxes. The interest item of $1050 is the minimum requirement under the financing plan by which seven per cent bonds in amount of $15,000 will be scld. If this plan falls down the interest requirement will ex - ceed the amount estimated. The Commission has said tor the last eighteen months or two years that prevailing cost of money renders it highly essential that invest - ments in public utilities in Nebiaska earn eight per cent provided the management is economical enough so that the rates are not relatively too high. In this case we are providing seven per cent only on the bonded indebtedness and figuring eight per cent on the stock. An Increase of Twenty-two Per Cent tit will be noted that the company is asking an increase of 18% per t over the rates now in effect. The increases brought about in 1919 advancing the farm line switching rate from 25c to 40c amounted </seg>
            <seg id="p226">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 299 to a three or four per cent increase in gross revenues. The total, there - fore, asked as a result of this application and the previous application on -witching rates is not to exceed twenty-two per cent. The company has had a healthy growth in the past three years or it would have been impossible for it to have continued operating as it has or to secure re - lief by so modest an increase. During the year 1920 the record shows that it added about eighty subscribers, the revenue from whom was a substantial addition. What this company has been experiencing in the way of increased labor cost is set out in an exhibit, which shows that when allowance is made for an additional number of employes, due to the growth of the company, wages of operators have advanced eighty-five per cent per person, the wages of lineman one hundred thirty-one per cent, and the wages of managers one hundred' eighteen per cent. Respondents, in brief, contend that the previous rates would earn a reasonable return under normal conditions and under proper management; that at the time of the hearing in 1919 no increase was asked for town service which must have evidenced that the rate was sufficient; and that at thia moment, when prices are on the downward trend, the company ought not to ask for an increase, thereby running against the tide. Briefly, in answer to this it may be said that no testimony was given attacking the management or its economy and that conditions at the present time are not normal; in fact, there have been no decreases in wages of operating telephone properties and practically no decreases yet iu the cost of materials. Conditions have changed very much since 1919. The testimony showed that the company had been compelled to increase wages, costs of its materials have very sharply increased since that date and the company has invested a large amount of additional capital on which it is entitled to a return. There is some force to the conten - tion that when we have passed the pinnacle of prices and are on the way down due consideration to that fact should be given in consider - ing rate cases, but it must be borne in mind that this company has had no peak of prices. It is still in the valley of pre-war selling prices of what it has to offer the public. Its failure to advance its selling price during the time when practically everything else sharply advanced to very high levels ought not now be a reason for punishing it by denying it a fair rate of return on its capital. It will be noted that applicant is asking for higher rates on its Bloomfield exchange than on the other two exchanges. A large part of the $34,000 invested during the past two years has been expended at nioomfield, resulting in a type of property considerably better than at the other exchanges. If the property at Bloomfield were segregated and expenses for Bloomfield were seggregated, the higher rates would be fully justified. In our opinion they should be approved. The people of P.loomfield have welcomed the improvement in this utility and must </seg>
            <seg id="p227">300 have known that such improvement could only properly be justified it the revenues were commensurate. The farm lines at Bloomfield remain grounded but the connections through the town have been greatly im - proved, all to the advantage, also, of the farm lines. We consider the rates amply justified from the point of view of cost and from the point of view Of comparative rates for like service in other parts of the state. I Applicant asks for a rate of $1.50 per mcnth net for farm line service Crofton. In our opinion the service at Crofton does not measure up the service of Bloomfield because all the property at Crofton is &gt;unded. We will in the order provide for the same rate for farm line service at Crofton as for individual residence service in the town, viz.: f65 per month gross, $1.40 per month net, a reduction of ten cents per â¢nth under the anioum asked. This reduction will alter the amount increases asked to approximately $4,600, or to 17.7 per cent. I Applicant has verbally asked that at Bloomlield it be authorized put into effect a two-party residence rate to meet those situations which are likely to arise where the existing plant will call for more than individual service in order to keep the investment at a minimum for first class service. We will approve the two-party residence rate a'- Bloomfield of $1.65 per month gross, $1.40 per month net, a reduction of ten cents per month under individual line service. This may further reduce total revenue increases somewhat, but consideration must b&lt; - given to the balancing feature of growth of business, which if Within reasonable limits does not correspondingly add to costs. COST OF SWITCHING We come now to the question of farm line switching rates. The ompanies switched by applicant appeared at the hearing in protest gainst an additional ten cents per month increase on the ground that the ervice does not ccst that amount of money and for the further reason lat if granted it will represent an increase of one hundred per cent ost to them over pre-war cost. At the time of the hearing in 1919 gures were used in ascertaining the cost of switching from the 191? xperience of the company and the Commission then found that the wenty-five cent rate had never compensated the company for the ccst to it. A representative of the switched lines testified that they were only anxious that they did not pay more than their share and hat they were perfectly willing to pay all that it cost the company to handle their business on a prorated basis, not desiring to unload any of the expense of dealing with them onto the town subscribers. Generally speaking, during the war-time period our investigations have disclosed that it cost fifty cents per month for switching service. A very careful analysis of the situation as to applicant company indicates that fifty cents per month is not too high a charge. </seg>
            <seg id="p228">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 In arriving at the figure we have taken all expenses which might properly be spread evenly among aj!l subscribers whose messages passed through the switchboards of applicant company in order to find the actual cost which might be thus evenly spread. These items include 1. Wages oi operators. Upkeep and return on buildings Return on lots used for central office buildings. 4. Upkeep and return on central office equipment. Depreciation on buildings and central office equipment. 6. Taxes on central office equipment and buildings. A credit to represent a proper burden against toll and miscellan- eous earnings. The total expense which may be spread over all subscribers alike 18 found to be $9,368, or $4.61 per annum per subscriber. .Certain other expenses are much more directly a charge on the company's own subscribers than on the switched lines. Special consid - eration was given for these expenses. They include 1. Maintenance and return on lines -within the city limits which carry the wires of the switched companies from such limits to the switchboard. '.'. Bookkeeping for the farm lines and for handling toll bills. 3. A small part of the time of managers devoted to dealing with the switched lines. 4. A small percentage of the general expenses of the central office. We have arrived at a figure of $1.25 per annum on each switched s-ubscriber to represent these expenses. The sum total, therefore, of the cost to the company of handling each switched subscriber is |5.86 per annum, or forty-nine cents per month. The company submitted an exhibit sbowing a somewhat higher expense, even without any return to represent the investment in that portion of the central office plant which should 'be carried by the switched lines. We are unable to agree with the company's compilations It has spread clerk hire and manager's pay evenly over all subscribers where obviously to us only a small part of the manager's time ought to be devoted to switched lines and a much smaller amount of time for bookkeeper than for a regular subscriber inasmuch as the officers </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: The original order in this case was entered effective May 1, 1921, authorizing certain increases in rates at the towns of Bloomfield, Wausa, and Crofton where telephone service is furnished by applicant. Be - cause of the rapidly fluctuating costs of operation and uncertainties. as to the future this order, in the same manner as practically all other orders entered during the war-time period by the Commission in the matter of rates was made temporary. It terminates by its conditions on December 31, 1921. Applicant a.sked for a further hearing and for such ates as in the judgment of the Commission should be established in the . future and that this hearing be held at Bloomfield for reasons apparent to it. The rates approved in the temporary order provided increases ranging from sixteen to 'twenty-three per cent which were the only ncreases allowed this company except on switching rates during war - time pinnacle cost of operation. At Wausa and Crofton the rates wort - put into effect without disturbance of any kind. At Bloomfield the com - pany lost practically all of its subscribers. It has added a small number of the old subscribers from time to time, but during the temporary rate period practically the entire exchange, involving an investment of more than $60,000, has been idle. It has cost the company a consider - able amount of money, not only in having property which is not earn - ing, but in direct operating expenses in excess of revenues received. To us at this distance it is difficult to understand the cause of this attitude on the part of subscribers. It is not due to the fact that the rates are too high per se. The subscribers were not conversant with the revenues and expenses of the company but were in a position to know what rates were deemed essential in surrounding territory. The only exchange in the immediate territory where the property is of the same character as that of Bloomfield Is Randolph where the rate.s are decidedly higher. At Plainview, with an inferior plant, the rates are slightly lower than those objected to by the Bloomfield subscribers. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">305 At Hartington, with quite a different plant, ithe rates are decidedly lower, that town being almost in a class by itself in north - east Nebraska for cheapness of service proffered. The attitude of the subscribers was not due to any unusually radical spirit or tempta - tion to destroy, for the businessmen of the town have shown no such .spirit as that except as to the results they are likely to secure from t he attitude they are showing toward this company. The wholesale quitting of service might be due to the fact that the rates are higher than the people can afford to pay. This is probably not the case in spite of some testimony to that effect. It is the only town in the state that has ceased using telephones although the rates paid are as low at Bloomfield as the average and the surrounding country shows no indica - tion of a condition of poverty in excess of that in other parts of ithe state. Xor can we see quite, if It is a question of finances, why it Is essential for subscribers to gather in mass meeting in order to ascertain whether as individuals they can afford to pay for telephone service. We are. therefore, forced to the conclusion that much of the dif - (uliy is a matter of errors in management by the telephone Com- pany. In such situations the company's responsibility is its own. The Commission has done its part as required by law. Considering the entire system as a whole the company has earned n the seven months the temporary rates have been in effect a total .vithout dividends. Specifically as to exchanges the company sets lorth in Exhibits 1 to 3, inclusive, revenue and expense accounts for the seven months the temporary rates have been in effect, showing That Crofton earned net for dividends $751.61; Wausa failed by $64.54 to lay expenses without dividends; and Bloomfield, where the disturbances occurred, failed to pay operating expenses, taxes and fixed charges by $5,961.36. These figures are subject to some scrutiny. It will be noted that toll revenues, being mainly commissions, are not regular each month but accumulate sharply quarterly. Allowance should be made lor that because October shows no credit for Its toll commission which will appear in later settlements. At Wausa Chairman Anderson of the committee of protestants pointed out that a year's coal bill had been charged into seven months. This appears to be a legitimate criticism. For the purposes of measuring the effect of a rate such coal bill should be spread over a year's time, although not necessarily so in the accounting system. The company has also apparently charged such general expenses o: _ $14,137.84 Its direct operating expenses in the same time were 17,773.53 Taxea and interest accrued and other miscellaneous charges added to this deficit in amount 2,369.31 leaves a loss for the seven months of 6,005.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p233">306 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL. REPORT as clerical help and managers salaries on the basis of time spent. Under the peculiar conditions of the seven months this has resulted fan the towns of Crofton and Wausa bearing a larger share of such ex - penses than would normally be true. In measuring a rate, account should be taken of this. For example, officers and clerical help for the seven months cost subscribers at Wausa 31 cents per station per month: those at Crofton 29 cents per station per month: and at Bloom- Held 14.7 cents per station per month. In arriving at these figures we have considered switched lines equivalent to one station each. tWhen all these things are taken into consideration, the situations Wausa and at Crofton are not as bad as they appear in testimony. In fact, had everything been normal in the territory served by this com - pany there is little doubt but that both Crofton and Wausa would have paid their way plus a fair return on the rates in effect. A general impression seems to exist, not only at Bloomfield but throughout the state, that in the exercise of its power of regulation the state has unlimited and arbitrary authority and that it can at vill deny public utilities any return wherever in its judgment no re'urn ought to be earned on account of business conditions. Xo such power exists either in this Commission or in the legislature, nor can the power be attempted without the intervention of the courts unless both state and federal constitutions are altered. Any of these public utilities, however. nay voluntarily do what the Commission cannot require it to do. It may forego its dividends. It may even agree to operate at a loss and pay the difference out of pocket. Where circumstances warrant such pri fer, this Commission will not object. This is the situation at the Union Telephone company, applicant herein. In filed brief the company has stated its willingness to forego any returns if necessary and to make reductions in operating expenses in an endeavor to weather the storm brought upon it in this unpropitious manner. It proposes to make sharp reductions in the salaries paid its three managers. In the original order herein we found fault with the level of the pay of the three managers but refused to let it play a part in our conclusions because at best the rates approved were reasonablt - as compared with the rates found necessary for a large number of other companies. We think the company can readily make reductions at these points. It is proposed also to reduce other wages ajid injustice may result from such program. If wrong is done it is the fault of the people being served who, by their attitude, have made such action necessary. At Bloomfield there is sharp criticism of the allowance made by the Commission for maintenance and depreciation reserve. This criti - cism shows on its face that the critics have but little idea of what the words mean. A lawyer in the case added the maintenance and de- </seg>

He may have been speaking for effect tor he is far too well read a man to have any such, conclusions. Maintenance is entirely for the use of the subscribers. Depreciation re- rve is partly an insurance of continued service and partly a protection the investment. The decreases in wages proposed and certain small decreases in coat of materials, and prospects of still further declines, make it prob - ably possible for us to authorize the company to set aside nine per rent on the original cost of the property as carried on its books for maintenance and depreciation. This may not be a sufficient amount and in the light of the experience of a large number of other com - panies probably will not be. At its option the company may set aside more. If it sets aside only nine per cent and that proves to be an insufficient amount it is only one means by which it writes off a part of its investment and depletes its capital. It may also thereby cause de - terioration in service, but at Bloomfield, at least, this cannot be heard as criticism. During most cl the period of the temporary order the company has maintained twenty-four hour service at Bloomfield despite the fact that ts properties were almost in non-use. We do not think conditions war - ant that amount of service. The company will be authorized to re- duce the hours when service is offered as in its judgment appears best, merely keeping the Commission notified of the schedule of hours in use and changes from time to time. The rates at Bloomfield were predi - (ated upon service for twenty-four hours each day and more than six hundred subscribers. For some time a few subscribers have paid the rate although the amount of service offered by the company has been very limited. This does not appear to us to be equitable to the pres ent subscribers. We will authorize the company from the date of this order to make rebates to all of its subscribers in such amount as to it appears equitable until the exchange has one hundred fifty sub - scribers receiving service, the only conditions imposed in this order being that the rebates be the same in percentage on each class of ser - vice and to each subscriber in the class and that the company notify the Commission as to its plan. The Commission may find reason to object to the plan, but unless it does so the filing will be approved auto - matically. We deem it proper that hereafter the company make no charge for night calls at either Wausa or Crofton save between the hours of mid - night and six a. m.

In the matter of the application of the Kearney Telephone company for authority to increase certain exchange rates and to discontinue free service from Riverdale to Kearney. Appearances: For applicantâ E. M. Morsman, attorney; Warren Pratt, president; W. S. Clapp, secretary-treasurer; W. W. Johnson, manager. For protestants â John A. Miller, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING. TAYLOR, Chairman: This cause was heard at Kearney, Nebraska, on the 6th day of January, 1921, the hearing being fixed at that place at the special request of tun Kearney Chamber of Commerce and patrons of the Rlver - ilale exchange and the Union Valley Telephone company. Many sub - scribers and patrons of applicant attended the hearing, but the record consists very largely of the financial and statistical showing made by the company and the examination and analysis thereof by counsel for protestants. Pursuant to complaints of the public, the two telephone exchanges then existing at Kearney, one owned by the Nebraska Telephone com pany and the other by the Kearney Telephone company, were on July 1, 1916, consolidated. The consolidation followed extended nego - tiations between representatives of the two companies and after a hearing, on a complaint filed by patrons this Commission issued an order requiring such consolidation. Since July 1, 1916, the Kearney Telephone company, which purchased certain portions of the Nebraska Telephone company's property, has operated the system. In addition to the Kearney exchange, applicant operates small exchanges at River ciale and Sumner. Following the consolidation the operating company made application to this Commission for approval of rates for the consolidated service and on December 26, 1916, an order was entere( fixing rates for this service which were somewhat less than those applied for. On February 20, 1919, the Ccmission approved an increase in rates for the Kearney and Sumner exchanges of the company, sucl increases being made necessary by greatly increased operating cost resulting from war conditions. This schedule of rates was made effective for a period of six months and from time to time since then has been extended upon order of the Commissicn. The last extension expires May 1, 1921. It might be stated that in this order also the Commission declined to approve rates as high as those asked by the company. The Company now asks for a further increase in rates at Kearney and River </seg>
            <seg id="p237">310 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT dale, alleging constantly increasing cost of operation and placing par - ticular stress upon its failure, under revenues during the past few years to accumulate a sufficient depreciation reserve. The statements of the company show that through additions and betterments the plant has increased during the four and one-half years that have elapsed since July 1, 1916, from $195,460.74 to $244,718.05 on December 31, 1920. During this period the depreciation reserve has been accumulated from nothing, at the time of consolidation, to $12, 912.43. During the same period the company has paid interest at the Kte of six per cent on $80,000 in bonds, dividends at the rate of six r cent on $50,000 of preferred stock, and a total of $4,522.50 in divi - dends on the outstanding common stock of $89,950. A considerable portion of the dividends paid on the common stock went to certain stockholders owning a small amount of the common stock under a guaran - tee made to them in the early history of the Kearney Telephone com - pany. On a major portion of the common stock, therefore, no dividends have been paid since the consolidation. A summary of the operating results for the year 1920 is as follows: RECEIPTS. Exchange revenues Toll revenues $50,316.50 . 12.390.3S Total $62,706 EXPENSES. Operating expenses $24,882.61 Current maintenance 13,377.20 Depreciation 11,540.54 Taxes 2,400.00 Total 52.200 Net operating income Sundry net earnings . $10,506.53 363.09 Total net operating income 10.871.62 DEDUCTIONS.

These </seg>
            <seg id="p238">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 311 wages are still in effect and promise to continue throughout the year 1921. Had they been in effect throughout 1920 the net surplus would have been materially reduced. Very substantial increases were also made to the employes in the plant department, aggregating over $1200 ler year. Such expense is charged against the reserve for mainten - ance and depreciation but supports the contention of the company that ilic allowances for that purpose are not now sufficient. In its order approving the rates following the consolidation the Commission provided that the company should set aside nine per cent lor maintenance anil depreciation. Up to the year 1919. however, the company found it impossible to set aside the amount specified by the i ommission. In 1917 it expended and set aside only 6.7 per cent and in l'HS only 6.51 per cent. In 1919 it expended and set aside 10.38 per com. But the average for the three years was only 7.SS per cent. In ts order issued on February 20, 1919, the Commission provided that he allowance for this purpose should be increased to ten per cent. Since hat date due to constantly increasing costs for material and labor. Commission has found that an allowance of eleven per cent and even e!ve per cent necessary to properly protect and maintain telephone cperty. It is manifest, therefore, that this company has not been able to expend for maintenance or to accumulate for a reserve an amount even approaching that permitted by the Commission for other companies. The reserve for depreciation on December 31, 1920, was $12, 912.43. It â  hould be stated in this connection that the depreciation reserve was greatly depleted in 1920 because of a disastrous sleet storm which re - suited in great damage to the company's distribution lines. The total expenditure caused by this storm amounted to approximately $13,500. Except for this disaster (he company would now have in its depreciation reserve approximately $25,000, which would be about ten per cent of the book value of the physical property. The actual reserve amounts to I'.it five per cent of the physical plant. Without question this is too lew. The damage to the property caused by the sleet storm was, of i (vursc. unusual and should not be used as a basis for determining â i reasonable allowance lor maintenance and depreciation. The expense was actual, however, and cannot be ignored in any consideration o the company's financial condition. The condition of applicant's propertj is fast reaching the point where substantial replacements must be made, aggregating several thousand dollars. Without an adequate de - preciation reserve and without net revenues sufficient to pay reasonable dividends on outstanding securities, the company cannot hope to secure the necessary funds for the rehabilitation of its property. The public has a vital interest in this phase of the company's financial condition because the maintenance of good service depends wholly on the a4e i.aate maintenance of the plant. The Commission has never determined the fair value of the prop- </seg>
            <seg id="p239">312 orty of this company for sale purposes, that not having been necessary in past cases. On this point we said in our opinion of February 20, 1919: "It is not necessary lor the purposes of this case, in view of line ah owing ipresented, to determine the investment value in the common stock of the company. There can be no question that the bonds and preferred stock .represent an actual investment in the property by the owners, and it is altogether probable that the sacrifice of the stockholders is sufficiently large to represent a considerable portion, if not all, of the outstanding common stock." It might be added at this time , that the company has been very conservatively financed when we take into consideration that it has paid only six per cent on $130,000 of securities. In this connection it has been in a very fortunate position during the trying period of the war, when interest rates have been mounting rapidly and when other com - panies performing similar service have had to pay from seven to teu per cent The company was in a fortunate position so long as it was tot confronted with the prospect of increasing its securities. It now has reached the point, however, as we have already suggested, when it must prepare for the sale of securities in some form. The company has applied for rates which, on its own showing, would produce additional revenue in the amount of ever $12,000 per year. While the past history of the company, as we have reviewed it, and its future interests might justify such an addition to its revenue as conditions new exist, the Commission is of the opinion that decreas - ing prices of labor and cf material will render unnecessary so large an in - crease in earnings at this time. In the main it asked for an increase of seventy-five cents per month on business and fifty cents per month on all other classes of service. The Commission is of the opinion that increases of approximately fifty cents per month on business and twenty - five cents per month on all classes of service, with an increase of fif - teen cents per month on private branch exchange stations, will be adequate. On the basis of the present number of subscribers this would produce approximately $6,000 additional revenue. If we assume that there would be a surplus of $1,000 at the end of the present year on the present rales, the new rates would result in creating a surplus of ap - proximately $7,000. An increase of only one per cent for maintenance ;md depreciation, and we 'believe this to be the minimum requirement for this purpose, would reduce the surplus to approximately $4,500. This would be available for dividends on the common stock and would be equivalent to only five per cent on the $89,950 outstanding. The Eipany will be left free to distribute this surplus as it sees fit, al - ugh, in view of its showing with reference to the depreciation re - re, it should see that a considerable portion of the amount is de - ed to that purpose, this being particularly necessary in view of </seg>

The net rates we have suggested would be as follows At Kearney: Individual business $4.00 per month Two-party business 3.50 per month Individual residence .-. 2.25 per month Two-party residence 2.00 per month Four-party residence 1.75 per month Farm 1.75 per month P.

To maintain a proper relationship between the various classes of subscribers and to insure that each class bear its proper burden of cost, it is necessary that the farm service rate be increased at this time. In view of the present unsettled conditions, the Commission is of the opinion that the rates thus approved should be of a temporary character. For that reason they will be made effective only until February 1. 1922, at which time a further investigation can be made into the affairs ot the company. By fixing the dale at February 1, 1922. a complete shewing for the year 1921 will be available.

This not a reciprocal service, being only one way from Riverdale. A.s a art of its application, the company asks permission to discontinue his free service. While as a general policy the Commission lias an lorized the discontinuance of so-called "free service" between ex - nanges, there appear to ibe conditions in this case which somewhat ustlfy a continuation of the arrangement between Riverdale and Ki-ai - ney. Lines of the Kearney exchange run north directly into the terri - tory tributary to Riverdale with the result that people living; in th&gt;- same neighborhood are served from both exchanges. In other words, a number of subscribers really in the Riverdale zone get their service from the Kearney exchange. The number of subscribers of the Riverdale exchange is very small so that the added traffic due to the free ser - vice is not large.

The principal rates now in effect are as follows: n Per Mo. Business, net $1.50 Residence and farm, net 1.25 An increase of $1.00 is sought in the business rate and twenty-five cents in residence and farm rates. Applicant was before the Commission in 1919, seeking authority to increase its rates twenty-live cents per month and authority therefor was granted July 31, 1920. The Commission found that the service was inadequate at that time â that the service given the subscribers over a period of years was poor to the extent that much complaint was made by subscribers. The Commission at that time urged the com - pany to undertake an extensive program of replacements, improvements and betterments, with the view of putting the plant in condition to Kive satisfactory service. The company adopted the suggestion of trie </seg>
            <seg id="p243">316 Commission and has since July 1, 1919, repaired and replaced a consid - siderable portion ot its property at a cost of $10,924.24, and made addi - tions and betterments costing J4.863.90. a total of $51,787.14. tThe inventory and valuation of the Commission's engineering de - ment made in 1919 showed a construction cost value of $29,250.24, a depreciated value of $15,546.02. Applicant introduced in evi - â e an inventory and valuation made by Mr. V. 1&gt;. Hollister, of the engineering firm cl" Koenig, Hollister &amp; Co., under date of Novem - ber 1, 1920, and showed the property to be in much better physical E million by reason of the repairs and replacements recently made, e unit prices used by Mr. Hollister were based on the experience of s company and the condition of the property was determined by per - a;:l observation and age and estimated remaining life of the several Â£ses. He found the total construction cost to be $41,804.24 and the preciated value $31,237.49. tThe Commission would not at this time approve ;iu advance in 3 to be charged by this company, especially at a time when tiie pects are for a reduction in all units or expense entering into the maintenance and operation of the company, were it not for the reason that at the urgent request of this Commission the company did expand large sums of mosey in extensions, rebuilding and replacements, as sh f above. It would seem reasonable and fair to this Commission that pcrary help at least should be extended and such help is warranted the showing made at the hearing had on this application on January 1921. A reconstruction cost of $41,000, in our judgment, should be used as a basis for computing the allowance for maintenance purposes. In view of the increased cost of labor and material the allowance found necessary (or this purpose is eleven per cent per annum of stun v.ilue. A fair value of the property for the purpose of a return, including divi - dends on stock and interest on borrowed money, is found to be $30,000 and the rate of return found reasonable is eight per cent per annum. The testimony before the Commission establishes the fact that all oi the company's lines and property are now in first-class opera' inu condition and that the company is managed in a highly efficient man - ner. This is also borne out by the absence cl complaints as to service by subscribers. The rates on which the company will operate, after this order takes effect, are somewhat less than other companies are re - ceiving in the surrounding territory, as shown by evidence introduced. This, in a measure, is accounted for by reason of applicant's favorable location and natural environments, which contribute to the building and maintenance of a compact phone system. The subscribers should, in our judgment, benefit in some measure by this condition. </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING. COOK. Comissionpr The Lewellen Telephone company of Garden county. Nebraska, incor - porated under the laws of the state of Nebraska, on ihe 11th day of Sep - tember, 1020, authorized capital stock in the amunt of $10,000, divided into 200 shares of the par value of $50 each, for purpose of buying and taking over the property rights and franchise now owned by the Lewellen &lt;V Big Springs Telephone company, consisting of a main line now built :ind operating between Big Springs, Nebraska, and the ranch of S. P. DeUktonr, located on section 16, town 17 north, range 42 west of the sixth principal meridian, a distance of thirty-cne miles, together with three branch lines radiating from the town of Lewellen, aggregating about thirty miles, together with the various side lines connecting the users of telephones on said main and branch lines, and to cover the neeesuary t xpense of putting said main and branch lines in good repair and to nuke such necessary extensions and additions as will accommcdatp the patrons at said lint-. After a very careful investigation, we find that the incoipo-.ators' pur - pose is to consolidate several telephone lines that are now all connected, making them into one company with a view of improving the property and extending its lines in a way thatw ill give modern and better service. We also find that the officers and directors are responsible resident sub- scribers of the company. That the property when improved and con - solidated will probably represent a value that will justify the stock issue sought by this application. ORDER.

It is deemed necessary to handle this matter in two orders De- rase of the emergency nature of certain financing now necessary. In 1916 this applicant appeared before the Commission asking au - thority under the stocks and bonds act to do some refinancing. At the Lime that application was filed it had $100,000 in stock, $20,000 in bills pay;. hie. and $20,000 in bonds . It secured authority as follows: 1. To issue and sell 125,060 in common stock with the proceeds of which to take up $11,000 of outstanding bonds and $20,000 of bills pay - able. These were all held by cne individual who was willing to and did urrender and cancel $11,000 in bonds and the $20,000 in bills payable turn for $25,000 in common stock. 2. To issue and sell $30,000 seven per cent first mortgage bonds uu live years, from the proceeds of which to purchase existing distri- bution system in the city of Superior and to secure the necessary wording capital with which to operate said distribution system.

There is in the hands of the trustee $14,500 of the first and nding mortgage bonds. By the terms of the order $10,000 of this lint must be used in retiring the outstanding first mortgage bonds unless they are previously retired in some other manner. The company has also bank indebtedness of $22,920 and current bills cf $2,000, all in - curred for purpeses permitted by the stocks and bonds act. Of the $60,500 first and refunding mortgage bonds now outstanding $25,000 was re - cently sold, the proceeds of which have been used in the construction of the concrete extension to the dam. This necessary construction work must be completed immediately. It is the desire of the company first tc dispose of the eight per cent cumulative preferred stock in order to complete this construction of the concrete dam ami to retire certain pressing obligations owing bankers. The sale of the seven per cent preferred stock contemplated by the company is a secondary matter to be carried en in the future as co.idi - tions of the financial market will warrant.

The Commission deals with this application under the provisions f article 18, section 758, R. S. 1913. That law provides that securities may be sold iby public utilities "when necessary for the acquisition of property, the construction, completion, extension or improvement of facilities, e* for the improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the discharge- of lawful refunding of its obligations." It also provides that the Commission must satisfy itself that these evidences of indebted - ness are "reasonably required for the said purposes of the corporation." We said in the matter of the application of the United Electric Com - pany of Lexington, Nebraska. (Application Xo. 4140) dated December 13. l!il9, that it was necessary for the Commission to have reasonably de - tailed information as to the use to which the proceeds of the authorized stock were to he used, and that we were net warranted in authorizing a Urge amount of treasury stock to be disposed of in the future as circum - stances might warrant . In this case the purpose for which the $50,000 eight per cent preferred stock are to be put are definitely stated. The purposes for which the ven per cent preferred stock are to be sold are not so definitely ated because the company's plans are not yet perfected, in so far as ii is its purpose to sell such stock for retiring existing obligation, or for the refunding of the eight per cent short-time stock, the purpose is def - inite. However, inasmuch as 'this company must perforce rely almost ex - clusively upon the lecal market for its securities, it shuld be in position &lt;&gt; dispose of the seven per cent preferred stock as opportunity affords nd to use the proceeds as the law and pood business judgment pre - cribe.

No ac - tion was taken at that time on the application for authority to issue common stock as a stock dividend, first, because it was essential that the preferred slock financing be undertaken at a very early moment, and, second, because that portion of the application dealing with stock dividend involved a linal determination of the fair value cf the appli - cant B property and whether or not such fair value warranted an additional issue of stock.

Applicant is at this time purely a public utility For a great many years the property was owned by Guihrie Brothers ind during their ownership the business was transferred from a private utility to a public utilify. The senior member, Robert Guthrie, died and 'lis property passed to his heirs. Until last fall David Guthrie owned a half interest in the property. Under stress of circumstances, which in - cluded the inability of the company to linance the extension to its dam, made necessary by the widening of the bed of the stream durina a freshet in 191!&gt;, a financing that was absolutely necessary to secure proper service and the advantages of the water power. Mr. Guthrie sold his share of the common stock, viz.: $62,5UO, par value, tor (50,000 in cash, the purchasers being forty or more ot the business men of Super - ior. These men. according to the testimony, entered the corporation chiefly because of the very great necessity arising for improved electric service, both for residences and industries in the city. The financing approved by the Commission in the preliminary order herein was prac - tically all to be local in nature. The testimony indicates that in selling Mr. Guthrie felt that he was being severely "squeezed" as ;i result Of his financial exigencies and that he was selling property of far greater value than the securities which represented it. This matter is mentioned only for what it is worth and not because the sale price cf half of the property was indicative under the circumstances of its fair value. To ascertain the fair value other methods were resorted to. </seg>

The Commission's engineers made a careful inventory of the property and set up a valuation based on normal prices of such properties as were constructed prior to 1914 and actual costs of properties constructed after that date and also included a computation relative to the value of the water power right, using a dif - ferent formula than did applicant. Professor B. H.

The Commission's engineering department found physical property to be in ninety-three per cent condition an&lt;i the present value, based on original cost, in amount of $215, 883. ST. WV will now discuss some of the items appearing above and the dlffer- P;es existing in the two summaries, but will leave the question of the ter power value for later discussion in this opinion. tLand: Neither applicant nor the Commission's engineer gave full lsideration to land value. As a matter of fact the company owns, addition to five acres where the power house is located, eighteen d one-half acres through which the race runs. This land did not cost the company anything but it owns it in fee and is entitled to full consideration of the value at present prices. The decisions of the courts are unanimous, so far as we know, that land values must b&lt;&gt; considered as of prices at the time of the inventory. Dam: Forbes testified lor the Commission that in his opinion the dam could not have cost to exceed $8,785. For the company Johnston said that he understood the cost was $$15,000 but he hud no figures to back up this conclusion. It was based on statements madn by the original owners. Race: Part of the difference in Uih value placed l&gt; wo w nesses was due to the fact that Forbes used twenty-five cents per yar EJohnsUone used forty cents. Considerable difference was due to th that Forbes deducted for a natural channel one thousand feel i th, which eliminate;! part of the excavation, while Johnston? mail no such allowance. He testified, however, that his computations irei in error to that extent. Flume: Further computation was on the basis o( ubstitutin.c con - crete for stone at a price of $10 per yard. The company based Its computation en statements of the original owners that the flume cost $22,500 and that in general it would cost twice as much to reproduce it now. No figures were available to substantiate these conclusions. They were based on oral statements of Robert Guthrie, now dead. Buildings: It is admitted by both witnesses that the buildings cost $19,067 in the fall of 1916 and that in this figure was an item of $700 for engineering, which, it was agreed in the testimony, was a duplication of part of a composite figure for engineering. The entire E'ferenee between the Commission's engineer and the company's tness results from the application of prices of October. 1920, as corn - red with prices of about the same time lour years earlier when the ildings were constructed. Machinery: The entire difference between the witnesses on this item is due to the application of unit prices. Forbes took actual cost as </seg>
            <seg id="p258">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 331 shown by the books as of 1916, 1917 and a considerable amount in 1919. The company's estimate is based on inquiries as to prices of machin - ery units last October and was subjected to the criticism of the Com - mission's engineer that even on that basis it was measured by the in- stallation of individual units rather than the purchase of complete plants at cne time. Transmission lines: The transmission line to Nelson was built in 1918. Forbes uses the actual ccst. The company increased actual cost by twenty-five per cent, which, it was admitted was an arbitrary increase made to cover an assumed increase in unit cost if the line were to be built in the latter part of 1920. The transmission line to the cement plant, was built in 1919 at an actual cost of $5,912. The company uses reproduction value of $8,145, being an increase of thir - ty-seven per cent over construction cost. Even on the basis used by the company, commodity prices increased between 1918 and the latter part of 1920 twenty per cent and not twenty-five per cent, and between 1919 and October. 1920, not more than ten per cent increase. Distribution; stores and supplies; office furniture: It was agreed urn stipulated that the Commission's engineers, on the value of these terns, were correct. Tools: Xo inventory was made by either witness. The difference in value represents arbitrary conclusions, based, however, somewhat mi experience. General expenditures: Forbes used ten per cent of the original oost as representing engineering expense during construction', incidental organization expenses, and supervision during construction. He did not include in this figure anything tor the cost of financing or extraor - dinary legal expenses over and above the actual cost of preparing and riling articles. He admitted allowance should be made for financing, if such financing did cost the company money. There was some evi - dence en this point. The company used twenty per cent to cover all guaofal expenditures, including the cost of financing, which cost of financing was based on an assumed cost ot" securing money at this time ;.nd was not intended by the company to represent costs which were incurred. The question which now presents itself to the Commission is the proper basis to use in arriving at fair value of the property use( mid useful in the public service, and necessitates a discussion of the relative value of the two methods presented, viz.: first, reproduction cost, less depreciation, as of the time of the hearing; second, origlna cost, plus overhead expenses, which would have been necessary had the plant been constructed within a reasonable period unde normal price conditions. It fs a question which the Commission ha </seg>
            <seg id="p259">332 not fully grappled up to this time because it has recognized the many embarrassing features, both from the point of view of regulation and that of the ultimate advantage &gt;to tiie utility itself. During the high peak period of 1919-1920, many inventories of public utility properties have been made by the Commission and considered in rate cases and in the main it lias not deviated markedly from original cost in arriving at its conclusions. It actions on rate cases during the abnormal period have all been of a temporary nature. It has been the purpose oi the Commission to so advance rates as to provide a return on reasonable outstanding obligations and to provide sufficient operating Hinds to in - sure proper service to the public. It has left final determinations of fair value in a permanent way to future consideration of the many cases which have been before it and for the temporary period has been content to pass by final conclusions. In this attitude the Com - mission has had the frank support of most, of the utilities. They have been more concerned with the securing of revenues sufficient to pay current dividends on the obligations outstanding and revenues for operating expenses than they have been in the question of the actual fair value of their property at the time of the consideration. The Oom- Eissicn has not been blind to the fact that it has given valuations only mporary and emergency attention and that it must later deal witli em with far greater care. The same situation exists all over the country among regnlatii bodies and in the courts. Decisions ot the commissions quite un.v&gt; sally are rejecting reproduction new at the time of the inquiry i the sole measure of fair value. Some of them have been frank stating that their conclusions are laced with embarrassing court d Ens. State and federal courts have been differing very considt in their conclusions as to the law and tile equity of reproducti: as a basis for rate-making. tin its earlier cases the supreme court of the United States refust commit itself to reproduction new as a proper single measure i iving at fair value. tin Smyth v. Ames, 169 V. S. 546, the court used -present" as corn - red with "original" cost only as one of a number of factors properly to take into account in arriving at fair value. In later cases this high court appears to have given more weight to reproduction cost in arriving at fair value. In San Diego Land &amp; Town Co. v. National City, 174 I*. S. 739, the court approved finding of "reasonable" value at the time of the in - quiry but did not state that this should be measured alone by reproduc - tion cost at that time. In Denver v. Denver Union Water Co. 246 U. S. 178, the court did not disapprove the master's use generally of the measure of reproduction </seg>
            <seg id="p260">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 333 new and likewise in Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U. S. 153 the use by the master of reproduction of the properties as the measure of fair value was not disturbed. In Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 0. S. 19, the court Said it concurred with the court below in holding that the value of the property should be determined at the time when the inquiry was made regarding rates, but it added "We do net say there may not possibly be an exception to it, where the property may have increased so enormously in value as to render a nute permitting a reasonable return upon such increased va'UH unjust tc the public. How such facts should be treated is not a question now before us, as this case does not present it." In Minnesota rate cases. 230 I". S. 352, the court specifically stated i liar "The ascertainment of that value (fair value) is not controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas but there muet be a reasonable judgment having its basis in the proper consideration of all relevant facts." These cases were all considered either (luring the period when price trends were quite stable, or, if considered later, were considered on recordl made during such stable price periods. Hence, in none of the cases herein quoted and in no others of which we are aware hai the supreme court of the United States been called upon to decide a proper basis for arriving at fair value during the abnormal period through which we have been and are still passing. It must be admitted that subordinate courts have continued to be impressed with the basis of reproduction cost at the time of the inquiry, depreciated properly. In another phase of the Consolidated Gas case, designated in its new phase as Consolidated Gas Co. v. Newton, P. U. R. 1920 F, 493, Judge Hand of the federal district court of Xew York held specifi - cally that reproduction new at the time of the inquiry, properly depre - ciated, to represent the condition of the property, is the basis on which to compute rates, and declared that such conclusion was entirely justi - fied from a consideration of the decisions of the supreme court of the United States, in which he included most of those already mentioned in this opinion. His decision was rendered in August, 1920, at which time there appeared to be no warning or promise of change in the high price levels then in effect. In justifying his conclusions the court said in part: "But unless it appears that the new price levels are not tran - sitory, it is no answer to the company's complaint to say 'that at some future time prices may fall. When that time comes, if it does, the property must again be revalued, but meanwhile they are entitled to some protection and since these have become quts- </seg>
            <seg id="p261">334 tions lor the courts, to the protection of the courts It is significant in cur opinion that general commodity prices, as set forth by the United States Deyartment of Labor, have fallen from an index figure of 270 at the time of Judge Hand's decision to approxi - mately 175 at this moment. In Houston Electric Co. v. Houston, 265 Fed. 360. the federal dis - trict court did not agree with the Xew York federal court. In reaching a conclusion in that case tho ccurt followed a rule laid down in the Minnesota rate cases, supra, and used reproduction cost at the time of the inquiry, original cost and trend prices, and said in rtfcr running the "There is no requirement in the authorities and no reason to confine plaintiff strictly to the cost basis. It is equally manifest that it would be unfair to the public to require vt to pay upon a valuation upon present, prices under the unsettled conditions. In the short space of time mentioned prices advanced one hundred per cent under unprecedented conditions." In a recent case involving the value of the electric railway tr.iu.- - portation lines at St. Joseph. Missouri, the federal district court found flatly for reproduction new, depreciated at the time of the inquiry, regard - less of unsettled price conditions. Among the state courts the diversity of opinion i marked. For instance in a recent decision in Elizabethtcwn Gas Light Co. et al, v. Public Service Commission, li&gt;2tl V 1901, the Xiw Jersej supreme court holds that the reproduction new value, properlv de - preciated at the time of the inquiry, is the proper measure in ascertain - ing fair value for rate-making purposes. Bin, al tile same time. the. Illinois supreme court in State Public Utility Commission, ex rel. Spring - field v. Springfield Gas &amp; Electric Co., P. I". R.. 1920. ('. 650. sai&lt;l: "The appellee contends that the only equitable basis for deter - mining value lor rate-making purposes is the cost of reproduction, new, less depreciation. This contention cannot be sustained. The basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged by corporations maintaining a public utility under legis - lative sanction must be the fair value ol the property used by it for the convenience of the public, and in order to ascertain that value the original cost of construction, the amount expended in per - manent improvements, the present cost of construction, the prob - able earning capacity of the property under the particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating ex - penses are all matters for consideration and are to be given such weight as is just and right in each case." in discussing this conclusion the court refers at length to some of the same cases that were cited by Judge Hand in' arriving at exactly opposite conclusions.

Offcial Department Reports 81, where he was, called upon to pass on the question of prop - erty values at prices in effect in 1918, which were considerably lower than prices at the time applicant in this case made its inventory, in discussing reproduction new as a basis for arriving at a fair value of thf properly he paid: â While it is important to consider the cost of reproduction in determinins the fair value of a plant for rate-making purposes. it cannot be said that there is a constitutional right to have the rates cf a public service corporation based upon an estimated cost of reproduction of its property at a particular time, regardless of circumstances. To base rates upon a plant valuation simply rep - n scnting a hypothetical cost of reproduction at a time of abnormal ally high prices, due to exceptional conditions, were manifestly unfair to the public, and likewise to base rates upon an estimated cost of reproduction tar below the normal bona fide and prudent investment because of abnormally low prices would be unfair ta 'the company. If, however, we are not to take the actual cost of reproduction at the present time, or within a year or so, because ii would be an abnormal cost, and we are to seek same fair basis of estimateing the value of plaintiff's property for the purpose of determining the validity of rates, it would be difficult to find any basis mere just than an appraisal carefully made by public au - thority and based upon reproduction cost before the outbreak of the European war, with proper consideration of the actual invest - ments since that time.'' The supreme court of the District of Columbia in an opinion rend - ered March 2. 1920, in Potomac Electric Power Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 1'. I'. R. 1920 C. 326, quoted Ex-Chief Justice Hughes as bove. approvingly and said further as to valuation: "It would lese all value if made as of an abnormal period when prices were abnormally low or high. To be of any assistance or real use it must be made as of a normal time and the unit costs as applied thereto should extend over a sufficient number of y*&gt;ars to show a normal trend of prices." It is obvious that had a valuation been made in September or Octo - ber, 1920, on the then cost of reproduction and the applicant had been permitted to issue securities based en fair value thus arrived a/t, such securities would not now be fairly represented by property. General commodity prkes have been reduced since September, 1920, more than one-third and are still falling rapidly. It is quite true that the parti cular materials which go to make up the particular property of this appli cant have not experienced such sharp declines. But it seems eviden to us that it is only a matter of a short time until those commodities no yet affected, because more carefully controlled or where the labor is a more important factor, will follow the general decline path. It is not a </seg>
            <seg id="p263">336 matter of years but of months. How far the downward slump will continue is, of course, a matter of conjecture, and how soon prices will again reach a figure which will correspond to 'the normal trend no one can tell. Valuations are arrived at only after much consideration by the parties in interest and by the regulating body. It is obviously quite im - practical to arrive at figures of fair value today which by the same measure will be unfair values tomorrow. 'If rates are fixed today on a valuation arrived at by use of reproduction as of the present time and at present abnormal prices, those rates will next month be unreasonable rates and will require further attention. With so many industries in - volved the regulating ibody cannot handle matters on such a basis. Nor is it to be the best interests of the utility or the public to have rapidly fluctuating scales of rates. In the big rate advance cases presented to the Interstate Commerce Commission under title Ex Parte No. 74 the railroads or the I'nited States made no effort to secure valuations on the baas of cost to reproduce. The large utilities whose service and rates are supervised by this Commission have not considered it a wise policy to even suggest that considerable accretions be taken into account in arriving at proper rate schedules. No one can tell at this moment what tite highest court in the land is going tx&gt; say on the subjeet when it is presented. It is quite possible that by the time the first case is pre - sented which embodies in full the contravened Question, the need tor the decision will, in large part at least, be gone. As we have shown, the lower courts are widely divided in their intepretatiou of the law. The Commission will, in so far as it recognizes the measure of physical property as an important element in arriving at lair value, con - sider that trend prices more nearly represent sound judgment in arriv - ing at fair value. In our opinion conclusions arrived at in this manner reflect the highest measure of ultimate advantage to the utility and at the same time approximate equity to the public. t Commodity price curves from 1900 to 1915, inclusive, advanced less one point per year as an average. If itlie upward trend were pro - sd through the war period without the intervening factor of the great upheaval, we should, reasonably have expected the price trend to be not to exceed five per cent higher than pre-war reconstruction cost at this time. Following the American Civil War, when the price curve suffered much the same regulations aa it did during the world war, prices did not again reach a normal ptane for ten years succeeding the war, al - though they came a large measure ot distance back to the trend plane within three or four years. If we are to consider that the previous ex - perience measures in any degree what we must expect in the future, the price level during the next decade will hardly reach the same plane as if projected pre-war prices were extended. For that reason we will, In considering this property, add twelve and one-half per cent to all items except land which were in existence before the outbreak of the world </seg>

On general expenditures some adjustment of Forbes' figure must be marfe because of the increases allowed as just mentioned and further moderate increases should be made in the percentage to cover the cost &lt;&gt;f financing. The company allowed seven per cent for financing. The record indk-ates that in 1914 an effort was made by Mr. Arends of Omaha to handle certain financing on a two per cent basis. It 4s further shown that local banks have undertaken to dispose of some of the necessary amount 01 the new issue of preferred stock on a two per cent basis. The record is clear enough that in the main the cost of floating the se - rirrities was nominal as the issues of stock represented investments fojr the owners, dividends returned into the property and surpluses earned, and the bonds were handled at a very low ccst because mostly *aken by those interested in the company. We have, therefore, used two and one-half per cent to cover financing and special legal expenses and have added this two and one-half per cent to the Commission's engineering department's ten per cent allowance for general expenditures.

We have remaining to be con - sidered three items: 1. Working capital. 2. Going concern value 3. Water right value. We will consider these in turn. 1. Working capital. Inasmuch as stores and supplies have been considered in the valuation of the physical property set out above, we only need to consider the amount of cash necessary to conduct the- Einess. The company's exhibits show that the monthly expenditures rant an allowance of not to exceed $4000 as working capital. 2. Going concern. This item is variously denned by regulating odies and courts but lias invariably been siven consideration in ar - ving at a lair value ot utilities' properties used as a rate basis. It epresents the intangible difference between a property either made p of a large number of disjointed units not in duty and a property with s various parts co-ordinated into a working whole, with an organiza - on perfected to secure efficient, intelligent and economical results and with a business developed to a point equivalent to that in existence at he time of th inquiry. It seems quite clear that this item must vary ith the particular circumstances. It might, or it might not, be meaB - red by the losses incurred in earlier years. It might represent in a measure the cost of producing business to its present volume. Even though that cost cculd not be definitely pointed out, because mingled in - extricably in the operating expenses, it would nevertheless follow tnai had not those operating expenses been incurred a larger return could have been paid or additional properties could have been built. In the case before us it does seem as though the going value were somewhat tied up with the value of the water power and that in so far as the going value is duplicated by the water power in working condition that fact should be taken into account in arriving at the figures. Courts and commissions have ranged from five to twenty-five per cent of the physi - cal property added for going value. It has been repeatedly said that it was largely a matter of business judgment with the particular case In the mind. We find the figure of $10,000 as representing the going value of this property. t3. Water power value. Three computations were presented on this icate subject. One by Chief Engineer Forbes of the Commission, one Professor B. H. Hollister of the University of Nebraska, and one by H. C. Johnston, secretary of the applicant company, who used the method E lowed by Mr. Hollister but with somewhat different bases. We will isider them in turn. </seg>
            <seg id="p266">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 339 Forbes' Computation of Water Power Value Mr. Forbes contemplated a plam. with a normal capacity and a market of IMMMM kilowatt hours per month. He computed the cost of ileveloping this much power with internal combustion engines, using three engine units. He considered the cost of producing this ii mount of power wholly by water power. He then considered thÂ« cost cf producing three-fourths of this amount of electricity by water power and one-fourth by internal combustion engines. He used the internal combustion engine because that is the stand-by equip - rneat now used by the ccmpany and because it is convenient stand-by I'quipmenit. He provided in his final computation for one-fourth of the i urrent to be produced by engine power because the testimony showed 'hat for two months in the year on an average it was necessary to use. engine power because of lack of sufficient water height. To be conserva - tive he added another month itc represent the various times when diffi - &gt; nlties might arise in the use of the water power. He found the cost of production of electric- current by all water method to be 1.9 cents per kilowatt hour and in producing by engine power alone a cost of 2.65 ceOUt per kilowatt hour. Using those figures and applying them to a divided production he found the saving in cost of production, three-fourths by water and one-fourth by internal combustion as compared with the cost of production wholly by steam, to be |6,S00 per annum. This - amount capitalized at. eight per cent would amount to $85,000. In ar - riving at his figures Mr. Forbes used physical property values that he lad arrived at in his study of orij "orth in detail. inal cost as has heretofore been set "His figures were criticised by the company, briefly summarized as follows of structures and machinery should original cost. A. The reproduction cost have been used rather than the B. Three cents and a half per gallon for crude oil for use in the internal combustion engines is far too low a figure and seven cents should have been used. C. The amount of engine oil allowed was only half as much as actual experience shows. Applicant's Computation of Water Power Value The company set forth a computation, using the plan adopted by Professor Hollister in applying it to their own valuations of physical property, differing from the figures used by Mr. Forbes in that they considered the output aa 90,000 KWH per month rather than. 100,000. It is not necessary to reproduce that computation. In brief it wbÂ» as follows: The cost of producing 90,000 KWH of electricity per month by a modern system plant at three and one-fourth cents per KWH, plus </seg>
            <seg id="p267">340 interest at seven per cent and depreciation at four and one-half per cent on a physical steam plant valued at $104,000, made a total cost of y:o - ducing by steam of $47,060 per year. The average cost of operating a water power company four and one - half years last preceding, plus seven per cent return and four and one - half per cent depreciation on the reproduction value as found by the Enpany of the necessary physical property essential in the product ion the power by water, made a total expense theoretically of $25,434. 5 savings by use cf water power at this cost were $21,626. By cap - i-alizing this saving at seven per cent and making adjustment for loss of efficiency in the use of four hundred cubic feet of water per second. the company found that the value of the water power was $207, ".61. In arriving at these figures the company used three and one-fourth Cents tthe cost of producing by steam, which figure they took from the ;imony of Professor Hollister, who has arrived at his conclusions n the experience with a modern steam plant at Norfolk. Nebraska, Professor Hollister used coal costing $6.5(1 per ton and figured five and one-half pounds of coal for the development or cne k. w, h. of electric This computation was criticised of record by Engineer Fort A. Because five and one-half pounds of coal had been fij;'ir&gt; where the experience of the Norfolk plant had been four and c:i half pounds. B. Because he had used coal at $6.50 per ton C. Because the company's witness had allowed lour and ont - half per cent depreciation of the steam plant, thereby duplicating a depreciation item included in the figure of three and one-fo'irth cents per KWH cost of production. The company admitted the duplication. D. Because reproduction new had been used for cost of phys cal property at a figure not admitted by the Commission's E. Because reproduction new at the present time was used considering the physical property of a steam plant. Some Other Computations kit appears consistent that if peak values are to be taken into con - eration in reaching lair value of physical property that similar con - eration should be given to the same physical property in arriving at a fair value of the water power. Quite obviously if reproduction figjres at the present time are used in finding the difference in cost of produc - tion 'by water power and its substitutes, steam or internal combustion, this value will vary as the physical property involved varies in. value and the cost of laTsor and fuel changes. We have, therefore, taken tnese various criticisms into consideration by a series of computations, which will be described briefly. </seg>

F. Using the company's method of computation with these modifi cationi 1. Coal at $4.50 per ton in place of $6.50 a ton. based on the fact that the six-year average price of steam coal laid down at Lincoln, Nebraska. 1914 to 1919, inclusive, was |4 per ton. 2. Estimating the cost of a steam plant ait seventy per cent of the figures used by the company in order to reflect more nearly normal prices of reproducing a steam plant. 3. Reducing the labor cost experienced by the company as shown by the computartion in amount of ten per cent to reflect the downward trend in wages already marked with common labor. 4. Trend prices of physical property used in manufacture by water power and valuations therefrom, as already found equitable in this opinion and used as fair value of the physical property. 5.

Hollister used S4n kwh 1 er annum, based on 1920 experience. The company alleged its v.ry rreat disability during that period and inability to supply the urseni demands. The company used 1,080,000 kwh per annum output, based on previous experience with some amendments. Forbes used 1,266,006 kwh per annum and testified that that amount ol current could be handily developed and that the market was without, doubt available From a consideration of all of the factors discussed above, we con - dude that the reasonable saving by use of water power as compared 'â â¢â¢ith any substitute which would have to be' used if water power w.?re not there available, capitalized at eight per cent, will amount to $100,000. The further question confronts us as to whether th*&gt; company is entitled to claim all of this saving. In previous decisions the Com - mission has ruled that the public should benefit in part from the saving by reason of the fact that it has loaned its water power to private parties, an act which it was not necessary for it to do and which pre - sumably it would not do if it gained no reward therefrom. The com - nany is likewise entitled to compensation for a portion of the saving else it will not hazard its capital in developing water power, which all experience shows is far less certain of success than steam power. Hol - lister, in his report to the city council, divided the saving between the public and the company and while he found the capitalized saving to K0O0 recommended to the council that the amount the compiny be entitled to was $77,500.

We will, therefore, add ;o the fair value of the physical property $50,000, as representing the value to the company of the water power rights. We thus come to the fillowinj; summary: Physical property $230,00*) doing value and working capital 14,000 Water power rights - 50,0â¬0 Total $294,000 We have already stated that there are outstanding obligations agatust t!ie present physical and intangible property of $244,420. The uncapitul - ized value in the plant is, therefore, $49,580. The company desires to issue $75,000 ol common stock to represent this additional value. It is clearly beyond the proper amount. I'nder the stocks and bonds statute of Nebraska, the Commission is authorized to approve issues of securities of public corporations for "acquisition of property, the construction, completion, extension or im - provements of facilities, or for the improvement or maintenance ot its service, or for the discharge of its obligations", and in authorizing issues Of securities the Commission must find that, in its opinion, "the use ot" the capital to be secured by the issue of such stcck, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness is reasonably required for the said pur - poses of the corporation." Is it not a reasonable interpretation of this chapter to conclude thai the company ewes to its s&lt;ockholders the value i! the water power which came into the company at the time the cor- I oration was organized in 1915, and that that obligation has not as yet been discharged? May we not say that such discharge of obligation is "reasonably required for said purposes of the corporation?" To hold otherwise would be to say that stockholders who had returned earned dividends into property to meet needs for additional capital might not claim the evidence of such additional investment as a stock dividend It seems clear that the intent of the law is to prevent abuses of corporate securities issues and not to forbid conservative activity. Such issue is not, however, a vital matter. The company has already proposed to finance in the future by issues of bonds and preferred stcck, chiefly of the latter. The only reason, for an additional issue cf common stock under the circumstances is that stockholders may have tangible evidence of ownership. If the Commission were called upon to say whether tt is j/ood policy to issue this commen stock, it should advise in ithe negative It does not, however, appear that its recommendation in this matter is cither essential or required by law. if applicant is entitled under the laÂ« to issue the securities.

OPINION AND FINDING COOK, Commissioner I Applicant operates exchanges at Blair, Calhoun and Kennard. Ne - iska, with a total of 960 subscribers, divided 3 50 business, 150 resi - nce and 696 farm stations, giving 24-hour service over practically :i &gt;tallic circuit throughout. The company has operated during the high 3t period without a change in its rate schedules, which fact accounts â¢ its present financial condition, and encourages the Commission to ut a higher rate, for a temporary period at least, that will provide ditional revenues. The present rates in force produced a total revenue from all source? for the year 1920 of $19,923.40. The operating expenses and betterments for the same period, as shown by the reports to the Commission ami a careful study of their books and accounts, were $24,349.38. which discovers that the earnings under present rate schedules are short $4,425.98. This deficit, together with those of previous years, has been taken care of out of the depreciation fund, by overdrafts at banks and fm borrowings. The Commission considers an emergency exists by i showing, and immediately set the matter down for formal hearing be held at Blair. After due notice to subscribers and to all parties concerned, hear - ing was held February 25, 1&amp;21, at the city hall, in Blair. The company was represented by its officers and the hearing was attended by sub - cribers of the company. The testimony anil financial .showing de - eloped by this hearing very clearly supported t lie conditions as set orth above as to the company's earnings and disbursements, and leads he Commission to the conclusion that a rate schedule should be ar - anged that would more nearly take care of the costs of operation and maintenance, with the following estimated results: APPLICATION NO. 4473 Anticipated Expense fcr 1921 ilaintenance and depreciation (IV, of $$71,700,001 $7,170,011 rraffic expense: Operators' wages (Based on last four months of 1920t $S.604.0O Power Expense (1920) 131.86 Other Traffic Expense (19201 27.30â S,763.1t </seg>

The Postal-Telegraph-Cable company stands in the position of being hostile to all three of the pro - posals of the Nebraska Power company and to insist that the protec - tion of its property and its service makes it essential that applicant seek another route between Fifty-second and Seventy-second streets, and in this connection it suggested the use of Seward street, parallelincr Blondo street at a distance of 1,050 feet to the south. Of the three propositions, applicant was most impressed with the construction of a single pole line on the same side of the street, now oc - cupied by the Postal Telgeraph-Cable company, and its joint use by the power company and the Postal Telegraph-Cable company. Testimony cf the Postal Telegraph-Cable ccmpany was that since it uses grounded return circuits for its telegraph messages, it was impracticable to so crnstruct a high tension transmission line in close proximity and Dre - vent undue interference. It was also alleged that these &lt;virtÂ»s are now used for a limited amount of telephone toll business and that it is the purpose of the company in the near future to extend its toll business. It was also alleged by the Postal Telegraph-Cable company that the con - struction of the transmission lines could not be of so secur? a nature that there would not be serious hazard to its property and Its employes. </seg>
            <seg id="p281">354 tThe Nebraska Telephone company presented testimony in opposl - 1 to the Postal Telegraph-Cable company being removed on the order the Commission to the same side of the highway now occupied by alleging that since the telegraph wires are charged with varying etric pressure and in excess of electric pressure ever the tole - &gt;ne wire that the use of the same pole line by the telegraph company by the telephone company would require extensive additional transpo- Eons of telephone company wires. It was also agreed, according to the timeny, that this would require a rearrangement of pole lines in cer - n places. The telegraph company ;;nd the telephone company submitted fig - t'i of cos; in the matter of the removal of the telegraph company's â operty to the same side of the highway as the tol-phon-' company OW occupies, which costs were, roughly. $1,000 tc move the twenty locks of telegraph lead and locate it on the opposite side Of the high - ay, $300 for tin: purchase of a one-fourth interest in the poles of the u-phone company; $2,200 to represent the cost of transpositions in the iephone company's line;, for a distance of four miles: $1,000 to repre - â¢nt the changes in pole locations and elevations to make room tor he Po-tal Telegraph-Cable company's wires underneath the telephone ires. These figures were apparently not checked by appik ant's nisin er, but were accepted by him. The telephone company and the tele - raph company, respondeu ;s herein, indicated by testimony that in heir pinion the full cost of removal of the telegraph lead to the same tide the highway with the telephone company and necessary alterations R the pole line and in the wire locations of the telephone company :ould be borne by the power company, in case such removal were ir - ered by the Commission. Applicant company did no; consider it should e lequired to pay more than the present value of the Postal cempanv's visting pole line lor a distance of twenty blocks, and that neces.-,iry "iingpOSitions as would be required in the telephone company's lines hould not be paid by it. The telegraph company submitted a statement f its property en the twenty blocks and from such detailed statement. ogether with testimony as to its per cent condition, we have determined hat the present value of the pole line, cross-arms and guys would not exceed $250. Relative to other proposals, the undisputed testimony was thai llie constructirn &lt;l the transmission line on separate poles on the same .-ide of the highway with the telegraph lines would cause no other expense to the telegraph company th;:n additional transpositions ot its eight Wires, and that the additional expense in providing for th â  construction ot a pole line cf sufficient size to permit of the location cu the telegraph wires underneath the power wires, wculd not exceed $500 above what ihe expense of the power company would be to construct a line, it' no ."IegTaph wires were involved.

Three questions of law were raised in connection with the hearing' (1) Has the Commission any discretion when it finds both, shies of the highway already occupied along which an applicant, which desires to build, wants to run the third electric transmission line, or must it ( rder one side of the highway vacated in the interest of the newcomer and assess the cost of such removal among the parties in an equitable manner? (2) Can the Commission, if in its judgment the situation warrants nch action, require the selection of another highway for the third comer than the one which it elects to use? (3) if the Commission orders one side cf the highway vacated, is it empowered by the electric transmission line, law to take into consid - eration other expenses than the cost of removal and the additional :1am - iges which may be suffered, either by private parties or by the prior wire line occupants? Paragraph three of section two of the law provides "In the event that a transmission, telephone or telegraph com - pany desires to construct a line under the provisions of this act en a highway both sides of which are occupied by telephone and tele - graph lines or transmission lines, the Railway Commission rhall order one side of the highway vacated and designate the side to be vacated and .shall assess the expense thereof to iiii parties interested in such proportions as in its judgment would best protect the rights Counsel tcr the telegraph company argue3 in brief that this pani - of all parties interested and those of the general public." Counsel for the telegraph company argues in brief that this para - graph must be considered in connection with that portion of paragraph two. which says that consideration shall be given to prior occupancy and. to the general powers granted the Commission in section three of the act, and that without such connected consideration a litrral interpreta - tion cf paragraph three of section two would give all the advantage to the third comer. The logic of this reasoning appears to be beyond ques - tion. It. does appear that the Commission must consider the rights of the previous occupants over and* beycnd assessing expense of the re - mcval of one of them to make way for the third comer. It appears also to the Commission that the provisions of section three, give full power and authority to the State Railway Commission after hearing, as pro - vided in section two to "make such order and prescribe such terms and conditions for the location and construction and operation of the pro - posed lines as to it may seem just and reasonable.'" </seg>
            <seg id="p283">356 Section 7420 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 gives to electric lines, desiring to sell current, the right of Â»minen- domain on the public highway, subject to an orderly method of acquiring such ;Ullt. Section 7418 of Revised Statutes of 1913 give the right on the public high - way to the lines of telephone companies and telegraph companies. It would appear, therefore, that all have rights granted by till- legislature for 'the Use of the public highway and in these statutory enactments no advantage is jnven to one over the other. These sections musi, however be read in connection with tin revisions of the eleHiie transmission line law enacted later. The logical analysis of all the above provisions o:' legislative eaact - ents would appear to indicate that the Commission has certain dlscre - onary power regarding the route which mp.y be Unloved by a transmit- On line if both the interests cf prior occupants and the interests ol the eneral public are affected.

As a matter of safety to the general pub.i^ and to ii'.sur dditional clearance for the protection of the service of telephone and elegraph lines, careful consideration rf all the circumstances in this ase does not indicate th;.t this rule should be departed from. This will iminate the proposal of application either to overbuild i'.i.- telegraph a j a:l n a separate pole Hne on the same side of the highway, or for j.iint se by the telegraph company of the same pele line with the high ten- - i.n transmission line, li leaves for consideration only two alterr â either the Commission must order the telegraph company to r its property to the same side of the highway with the telephone com pany under proper restriction and proper assessment of the cost thereof or it rausu require the selection of an alternative rente by applican company, between Fifty-second and Seventy-second streets. Respondent telephone company insists that If the Commission ureters :â¢â¢ vacation of one side of Blondo street by the telegraph company and 8 location, on the opposite side of the highway now occupied by t'le lephone company, that all ol the cost of changes made incident by such â moval and the continuation of adequate service should he borne by ie power company.

            <seg id="p284">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION* 357 \ I t I in the Blue River Power company desired authority to construct certain transmission lines, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, party adverse, insisted that the power company should bear the expense of transpositions of its Iinc3, made necessary by potential inductive inter - ference. In that connection the Commission said: "The Commission is of the opinion that it is the duty of the interested parties, under the requirements of chapt*:- 2t2 of the laws hi Nebraska for 1915, to do those tilings which are necessary in or - der thiit the operation of the transmission lines shall not needlessly interfere with the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing &lt;â¢Â«. nimuncation circuits which are properly constructed ac - cording to modern standard practice. And. furth "The Basewment against either or all parties of the expense of these transpositions and retrans-pasitions does not come within the I&gt;owers :.nd duties conferred upon this Commission by Senate File No. 65 of 1915. under which this application is made. If the parties cannot reach an agreement as to who shall bear the burden, thoir rights under previously existing laws are unchanged by this statute and the matter must be adjudicated by a court of oumix-teni jurisdic - tion." The cases are not quite parallel in that the extensive transportation ' ;iie Nebraska Telephone company's lines, which would be made teeei sary by the close proximity of higher tension of the telegraph eom - â¢ujiy. would be required, not by reason of the location of the power lines m the opposite side cf the highway, but by reason of ihe removal of. the elegraph lines on order of the Commission. The Corn-mission does, we Wtieve, have the power to consider this expense in connection with the ost of removing from one side of the highway to the other. The Com - nission does not. however, consider the i&gt;cint well taken that the power nmpany would be the only party bearing any portion of the expense. very probably the telegraph company would find itself with properties if longer life under the removal than before. It might also have cercain salvage- in the old line. In so far as more expensive pole line construc - ion is by '.lie telephone company found necessary, such added tele - jhone cons-traction would enhance the value of the telephone company's (ropei'iie;" and such expense ought not to be borne by the power com - iany. Nothing in the law would indicate that an existing public utility &gt;â  a highway is immune to expense made necessary by an additional ie of fie highway in the public- interest. Paving of highways already copied by electric railways may cause additional expense to the utility n the way cf heavier rails and other improvements but they cannot be ie;:vd to deny the obligation. However, [1 is not necessary to pass en these matters finally at this ime as we are of the opinion that all of the circumstances concerning he present application render it. advisable that applicant company select </seg>

It has taken similar positions in other cases be."0P le Commission. We have already found that in considering terms ol paragraph thrt'i of section two of the act, the Commisison must interpret it with due n eard to the provisions of section one and under its discretionary power in section three, if it finds "the reasonable safety, operation and eff ciency of existing lines" is interfered with, it may lefusr to order th vacation of one side of the highway for the third comer As a concrete example of a situation which would exist mission did not read into paragraph three ol section two some dlscri tion obtained from the terms or sections one and three. A bigfrwa may be occupied at a given moment by a heavy telephone lead on one side and by a high tension transmission line on the opposite side. Appli - cation is made by a third party frr authority to construct a transmissii n line on this particular highway under the terms of the act under con - sideration. If proper consideration is not given to sections one and Uiree, the Commission would have tc require either that the heavy tH&lt; phone lead move over intc close juxtaposition with the existing high ension transmission line, or vice versa, to make way for the third rcnin - r, although it is very evident that in doing so the prior occupants are eft in a less favorable situation than the third comer. This situation â¢ould have added menace with the advent of the fourth and fifth omer. it is our opinion that if such a situation should arise the reasan ble safety and efficiency of existing lines would be interfered with ami that, if this conclusion should be reached with a proper n:-.sis of fact, sec - on three authorizes the Commission tc prohibit the proposed constnic - on by the third comer. The conclusions as to power to prohibit are trengthened by the additional provision in section three that the Com - mission Shall make "such orders in the premises as in it.*-- judgment would &gt;est prefect the rights of all parties and those of the general public." </seg>
            <seg id="p286">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 359 We are led to the conclusion, therefore, that where circumstances war - rant such an action the Commission can prohibit construction on a sriven portion of a highway despite the general rights on the highway granted in the earlier statute of section 7420 of the Revised Statutes o\ Nebraska lor 1913. If applicant is prohibited from building on the same highway with the two existing occupants between Fifty-second and Seventy-second -treets on Blondo street, it must, perforce, select some alternative route it is to construct We are also confronted with the question of whether the denial of lie right to build on Blcndo street, under existing circumstances, is nn oreascnable exerciee of the discretionary powers of the Commission and ua undue burden upon the applicant, if applicant should elect to con - :ruct on Seward street, as heretofore mentioned, it will require an ad - iiitional construction of 2,100 feet of pcle line, costing at the rate or $2,500 per mile, a less satisfactory highway for access for maintenance ;md construction purposes, and a constant additional loss of current in transmission due to the more circuitous route. We do not, however. consider these facts a sufficient offset to the constant interference with service which would result by the occupation of one side of Blondo street by the two existing wire companies, who cr.nnct be wholly compensated l&gt;y money payment. Tim conclusion has more force when it is consid - ered that the additional expense of the longer construction of a cir - ctiitous route by the pewer company would be effset in whole or in part by its share of the $4,500 expense, which would be necessary if the tele - graph company were transferred to the opposite side of the highway to ake reran For applicant's high tension transmission line.

Appearances : For Applicant, â Henry Torpin, president; George Daughhetee, treas urer and manager. OPINION AND FINDING. TAYLOR, Chairman I The Oakdale Telephone company was organized January 1, 1921, â¢ the purpose of taking over the properties of the Cedar Mutual Teh - one company, serving Oakdale and tributary territory. The new or - ganization is composed wholly cf the stockholders of the old, the changt - being in the nature of a reorganization for the purpose of establishing the enterprise on a better business looting. It is proposed to issue the stock of the new company to the stockholders of the old in ex - change for their interest in the property. The property consists of a telephone system of 342 subscribers, which has been operating in that territory fcr many years. It was started in town as u community en- tirise and later lines were extended into the country. Stockholders tribute^ not only cash, but furnished material and performed la - bor in the construction of the plant. HVm lines were first constructed with native poles. Later these were replaced by the company with better poles. Two or three years after the organization began business its office was burned and all the original records were destroyed As a result it has never had a reliable accounting system, no valua - tion ol the property ever having been made. The old company had an authorized capital of $5,000. but stock was issued in the amount of $7.80n. It was partly to cure this unintentional violation of the Stock and Bonds Act and partly to establish the business on a better basis that the reorganization was decided upon. Lin February, 1921. the engineering department of this Commission e a valuation of the properties and found the original construction cost to be $16,977.56. The depreciated, or present value, on that basis was fcund to be $9,407.28. Officers of the new company criticised the valuation of the real estate, which is included by the engineer at $90" for the lot and $900 for the building, original cost, and $900 for the lot and $600 for the building, present value. It is claimed by the repre - rtatives of the company, who are old residents of Oakdale, that the and building are easily worth $2,000. Henry Torpin, president of the company, erected the building at a cost to himself of $1,400. Since that time a garage, costing $300, has been added. It would appear, therefore, that the claim of the company of a value of $2,000 a&gt;t tie </seg>
            <seg id="p290">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 363 j.iesent time is not unreasonable. In reply to a question the engineer of the Comission stated that H was his opinion that it would cost S20.000 to rebuild the telephone property at this time. This estimate vas given hastily, apparently without full consideration of all the cir - nnnstantes. Costs of material and labor in telephone properties in - i reased at one time at least seventy per cent. There has been some &lt;hange in these prices, but it is conservative to estimate that the costs at the present time are at least fifty per cent greater than they were before the war, or at the time this property was built. Applying 1'iis percentage to the original cost would produce a reproduction root Ht ?25,465. This would give a depreciated, or present value, on that basis cf $14,005. Adding $500 to the depreciated cost on the original â¢ -oat basis to represent the correction in the value of the real estate. i-'ives us a figure of $907. With all of these figures in mind, and bearing in mind as well some allowance for working capital and going i oncern value, the Commission is of the opinion that $13,000 represents ihe present fair value of the properties involved. The Company is desirous of issuing at this time $12,800, there be - ing of record 128 stockholders in the old company. To each of these \ ill be issued shares of stock of the par value of $100 per share in ex - Â« hange for their interest in the old property. Originally there were 130 stockholders. It is impossible, however, at this time to locate two of them. Unless they can be located the two additional shares will not be issued, although the company desires to have them ap - proved in the event these stockholders can be found. ORDER.

            <seg id="p291">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 364 OPINION AND FINDING. BROWNE, Commissioner: On Ocotcber 9, 1920, the American Railway association, on behalf of Nebraska carriers, filed aplpication for certain amendments to demur - rage tariffs, which application was heard on November 23, 1920. in the Commission's offices. At that time similar amendments to the demurrage tarriffs, were on tile with the Interstate Commerce Com - mission to automatically go into effect unless suspended. That fact vas taken into account during the hearing. The Interstate Commerce Commission did suspend the tariffs as filed until March 31 and pro - vided for a hearing in January on the merits of the proposed change?. Ac a result of the suspension Nebraska carriers, through F. Mont - morency, chairman of the traffic committee, filed a motion to with - draw the application in question and action to that effect was taken by the Commission December 28, 1920. L Under date of January 10, 1921, J. E. Fairbanks, agents of the erican Railway association, on behalf ,of Nebraska carriers, filed application for certain amendments to the same demurrage tariffs but very considerably amended from the original application. This latter application proposes to amend item 10. rule 8, paragraph 2 of section A to read as follows: "When, at time of actual placement, lading is frozen so as to require hea.ting. thawing or loosening to unload, th&gt;- tree time allowed shall be extended forty-eight (4S| hours, making a total of ninety-six (96) hours' free time, provided the consignee shall, within forty-eight (4S) hours after actual placement, serve upon the railroad's agent a written statement that the lading was in such frozen condition at time of actual placement." And to amend item 11, rule 9, section E to read: "A party who enters into this average agreement shall not be entitled to include therein cars subject to Rule 2, Section B, nor shall he be entitled to cancellation or refund of demurrage charges under Section A, Paragraph 1, nor under Section B of Rule 8, except where bunching has been caused by strike nf carrier's em - ployes, or where shipments of coal, withheld by the carriers to protect its fuel supply, are subsequently delivered to consignee in accumulated numbers." Neither of these propositions affect in any degree the rates charged for retention of cars. The first change quoted above allows forty - eight hours additional free time in which to thaw lading which is frozen at time of actual placement, whereas up to this time the rule has been consignee was allowed all necessary time to thaw the load and forty - eight hours thereafter in which to unload. In our opinion the proposi - tion is reasonable. The consignee should not be given unlimited tune in which to loosen a frozen load. If proper effort is made, occasion will indeed be rare where thawing cannot be perfected in forty-eight hours' time. Open top cars, which are chiefly affected, are frequently in </seg>
            <seg id="p292">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 365 very great demand. During periods of scarcity of equipment for coal moving, that movement receives a preference, and movement of. sand and rock, with which we are chiefly concerned in this application, has secondary consideration. With the demand for cars very great, it ap - pears reasonable that the tariffs provide every inducement for unload - ing cars after placement. The changed rule will be approved. The second amendment quoted above is in the interest of the ship - per who operates under the average agreement, inasmuch as it pro - vides an exception where bunching has occurred due to two reasons of carrier's disability. Under the present rule no such exceptions are made. Inasmuch as that proposition fully protects the shipper we do uot deem it necessary to set this matter down for such showing as shippers may desire to make. The Interstate Commerce Commission has reconsidered its pre - vious suspension and has authorized the two changes as herein dis - cussed, and as we understand it, the original application before the Interstate Commerce Commission, now carried under 1 and S docket No. has been, or will be withdrawn before that body.

Curtis?., Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4499. rthe matter of the application of the Beaver City Telephone company for authority to sell $50,000 of stock. Appearances For applicantâ W. F. Ellis. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: t Prior to January 1, 1921, the Beaver City Telephone company was partnership composed of A. Gaddis and W. F. EHis, equal owners. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 367 On the date referred to the company was incorporated with an author - ized capital of $100,000. Prior to June, 1920, the property consi3ted of one exchange, located at Beaver City, serving approximately six hundred subscribers. On that date, the partners purchased a small ex - change at Edison, serving about two hundred subscribers. The pur - chase of the second exchange and the growth of the property prompted the partners to incorporate. It is now desired to issue $50,000 of com - mon stock, covering both properties, ten thousand dollars of this being intended to represent the Ediscn exchange and the remain'ng forty thousand dollars to represent the Beaver City exchange. The Commission has made several investigations of the Beaver City property and its financial history. In Decemer. 1916. the engin - eerinR department of the Commission made a physical valuation of that exchange, which showed a cost of reproduction new at $35,386.26 and a depreciated value of $23,516.64. At the same time an extended study was made of the financial history of the property and as a lesult of all the information ascertained a fair value for rate-making purposes was fixed at $25,000. This exceeded, as will be noted, Ihe depreciated physical value cf the property, allowance being made for working capital and other elements of value. No valuation has been made for the purposes of this application. Applicant asks for an allowance of $40,000 of stock on the basis of the value as shown by the bocks, which is $40,872. Pull allowance of this claim cannot be made, however, since it disregards wholly any depreciation existing in the phy - sical property. As was shown by the physical valuation and inspection made by the engineers in December, 1916 the property was at that time in about 60C; condition. Substantial replacements have been made since that date. The fixed or physical property, as shown by the books as of December 31. 1920, amounts to $36,982.56. Assuming that the prop - erty has been materially improved in its condition but that it is yet in only a 70% condition, which is somewhat above the average for properties of this character, the depreciated value as of that date would have been $25,887.40. The books show free assets in the amount of $3,890 consisting of materials and supplies, rentals owing by sub - scribers and cash items. Such assets may not always be properly in - cluded in book value since they cover a variety of things and in conse - quence are susceptible of readjustment. The sum in this case, how - ever, appears to represent rather tangible assets and may therefore be included as a part of the present value of the property. Adding the assets to the depreciated value of the physical property we have an approximate total value of $29,777. In the opinion of the Commis - sion this represents within a reasonable degree of accuracy the pres - ent value of the property. As already stated, the fair value of the property as of December, 1916, was found to be $25,000. Only partial dividends on this amount have been paid since that time. We cannot </seg>
            <seg id="p295">368 ascertain definitely the amount of these deferred dividends due to tne practice for a portion of the period of the partners drawing money from the company somewhat in excess of their salaries. It is quite clear, however, that the owners are short at least $5,000 of a reasonable re - turn upon their investment for the years 1917. 1918, 1919 and 1920. The record clearly indicates that the property has been increased in value and it appears thait the deferred dividends have been used in rebuild - ing and extending the property. As a mater of fact, the money ior this improvement appears to have come largely from this source. If to the fair value of $25,000 found in 1916 we add the $5,000 of deferred dividends the figure of $30,000 might properly indicate the present fair \a.Iue. In this connection it should be said that the book record is not entirely reliable for the reason that it has been recast at least once during the four-year peiiod. The Commission ia of the opinion there - fore that a fair value of not to exceed $30,000 should be allowed for the Beaver City exchange. This includes an allowance for materials ,*nd supplies sufficiently large to cover working capital and cash ami credit items in an amount sufficiently large to represent any going con - pent value that may inhere in the property. The partners paiii $6,500 for the Edison exchange. In March, 1921, the engineers Of the Commission made a valuation of this exchange and found an original cost of $12,175 and a depreciated cost of $7,673. Since ;.urchasing the property applicant testifies that at least $1500 has been expended on it in regain and replacement*. Mr. Ellis, one of the partners appearing for the applicant, was inclined to criticize the amount cf depreciation found by the engineers, but was of the opinion that the figure of $12,175. representing original cost, might be liberal. Ho testified that before purchasing the property he made a rough valua - tion and reached a figuie of apipoximately $11,(M)O. He stated that he and his partner considered the property worth at least $10,000 when they purchased it. It seems evident, however, that they did not take into full consideration the real condition of the plant. The valuation made by the engineers came after the replacements made by the new owners had taken place. The engineer of the Commission made a count of all the property and a careful inspection of the same. The Com - mission is inclined to rely on his figures since applicant offers noth - ing but a rcugh estimate as a substitute. The figure of $8,000 as a fair value of this property would represent the plant in its present physical condition and allow for working capital and going concern value, if there is any in this plant, which appears to be doubtful since it had become trading property. In the hands of experienced tele - phone men like Messr3. Gaddis and Ellis it should develop as a reasonably paying addition to the larger property. We are therefore of the opinion that $8,000 represents the fair value of this plant. it follows thereforÂ© that $38,000 in the opinion of the Commission </seg>

            <seg id="p298">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 371 The proposed changes will supply ten minute service to the Bur - lington depot and thirty minute service to the North Western depot. It will enable the applicant company to move one car from the South 17th street line for use elsewhere and still maintain 'the same headway as at present. H is estimated by applicant that this economy will save operating expenses in the sum ol $24 per cay. The only question involved in .this change is whether the pro posed service is adequate for the North Western depot. A traffic study, made on Jauary 26, 1921, by request, showed rather light traffic to the North Western depot and somewhat heavier traffic to the University. This service may be somewhat inferior by the change. Present condi - i ions of earnings and expenses of this company impel the Commission authorize any changes which will perfect economies without too sreatly interfering with the service of the public. It is the opinion of the Commission that the proposed change does not unduly interfere with the service. The company will i=sue such instructions to train crews as will provide for propt-r notice to passengers of the change of schedules so that transfers can be made with least inconvenience until the public be- :&gt;ine well advised of the change.

Former free service extended to Oakdale, Tilden, Clearwater and other exchanges to the north, which extensive territory has slowly been eliminated by action of the connecting companies, this with the approval of this Commission in divers other proceedings. At Albion all town service is metallic magneto. The farm line service is grounded. At all other exchanges of Albion the service is largely grounded and without exception the rural lines are grounded. Many of the rural lines are heavily overloaded. A majority of them are poorly constructed, some of them indeed are types of construction so rheap and subject to such interference as to be in a class almost by themselves. Prayer of the Petition The prayer of the petition is (a) to cancel all grounded rates in town; (b) to readjust rates so as to pay returns on additional capital proposed to be invested in extensive improvements of property and service, to extend over a four year period, and these rates also to pay â certain additional operating expenses proposed in the application: (c) to eliminate free service to the foreign companies now interchanging with applicant, as set out above. Program Proposed Applicant set forth in the hearing in great detail its improvement program which it desired to undertake in crder that the company might &gt;be as fully commercial in its class of service as the territory warranted and to meet and overcame the rapid deterioration now taking place in property so poorly constructed initially. I. At Albion in town it is proposed to put in extensive cables, to install a common battery switchboard of larger capacity than the pres - ent magneto switchboard, and to make the entire city plant common ibattery. In the country it is proposed to cut the lines down to twelve. or fewer, subscribers to the line. In testimony the company estimated the total cost of this improvement program at Albion alone at $40,000 or more, of which almost two-thirds would represent additional capital investment. An alternative program is offered for Albion, including a new up-to-date magneto switchboard of five positions and a reconetruc- </seg>

It is proposed to cut the rural lines to SUCh a num - ber per line as would insure up-to-date service. The program includes the replacement of over one thousand poles with standard poles. The estimated cost of the improvements at this town is placed by the com - pany at $12,000 to $13,000. 3. At Lindsay it is proposed to make minor improvements in town and to rebuild the entire rural system, install about 1,850 new poles, cut down the number of subscribers per line, and to make other improve - ments at a total cost of about $13,000. 4. At Loretto it is proposed to expend about $2,800 in improvements and replacements, mostly on the rural lines. 5. At Monroe to rebuild the country system extensively, replacing 900 existing poles With Standard poles, cutting down the number of sub - scribers to the line and investing about $7,200, practically all of it on 6. In the city of Newman Grove to spend $5,600 on Improvements and replacements, including 6,200 feet of cable and a new magneto board. The rural lines out of Newman Grove to be completely rebuilt. including the stringing of two hundred miles of No. 12 and No. 14 iron wire as new construction and replacements, tutting down the number of subscribers per line and placing and replacing 2,650 poles with standard â poles. The total expense of the rural work at this point is estimated at 421,000. 7. At Platte Center it is proposed to make minor improvements in town at a cost of $1,150, which would be borne equally by applicant an'! o. fanners' organization which owns jointly at this point with applicant. On the rural lines the company proposes to install 1,050 standard poles &gt;as new construction and replacements and to use altogether sixty mile* of new wire. The cost of the rural work alone is placed by witnesses at 18.500. 8. At Tarnov it is proposed to invest $1,700 in improvements and in replacements. Property Valuation The nature, of the proceedings in this cause does not require that the Commission, establish a fair value of the property as a rate base. The value of this company's physical property Has been gone into by the Commission repeatedly and findings have been made thereon. The </seg>
            <seg id="p302">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 375 company in this proceeding asked only to earn on the value of the stock already approved and other securities outstanding. It has in - cluded in testimony and in the application much material bearing on the value of the physical properties, but in the main has in that show - ing followed the original inventory and prices used by the Commission's engineering department in the spring of 1916 and has added thereto the additions and betterments from the book record made to the properties since that date and subtracted therefrom the property removed by con - solidation and other means. In findings on Applications N03. 2836 and 2953 the Commission found the combined properties of applicant as of April, 1916, to be $106,736. The company protested this valuation which "was made on consideration of various factors, none of which was repre - sented by war-time values, and on rehearing presented such testimony as to omissions by the Commission's engineers and errors in tabulation which justified the Commission, in a supplemental order dated July 26. 1921, in authorizing the issue of additional stock up to $114,025 to reprÂ» â  sent investments made. This finding of the Commission took int.) account also that there was outstanding $9,700 of notes payable repre - senting borrowed monies for improvements made since the date of the investigation resulting in the original order and in the supplemental order of recent date. The company, therefore, has outstanding $123,725 in securities on which it desires to earn a return. As to whether property exists to represent these securities we are in this case only interested with the notes payable. The company made ample showing that this money had been invested and that property existed to represent it. "Without taking into account any overhead expenses, the company invested in the period following the original survey of the property more than $28,000 in additions and betterments, the money for which was secured by borrowing depreciation reserves and surpluses, and through the sales of these notes. The company's financial statements of recent years are subject to considerable criticism in that they have .been built on the assumption that no depreciation occurs in the property over and above the amount offset by current replacements. That such was not the case was very evident in the original finding of the Commission. The company has. however, continued to pass to earned surplus money which really be - longs to the depreciation reserve for the protection of the properties of the stockholder and the service of the public. This has not been done with an ulterior motive as the money has not been paid out in dividend* nor have securities been issued against it. The so-called surplus has been invested in additions and betterments and even in replacements. To correct the mistaken impression to be gained from the company's balance sheets, at least at the time of the hearing in this case, the company will 'be expected to discuss the matter with the Commission's engineering and accounting departments and to so adjust its liability </seg>
            <seg id="p303">376 .statement as to properly represent by an item of depreciation, reserve the accrued depreciation of the properties. Such adjustment will prob- ably wipe out the item of surplus, which, as we have pointed out, is largely a fiction of bookkeeping. In measuring the properties against the securities outstanding ; .h&gt;.; Commission is further supported in its conclusion that such securities fall well within the fair value of the property by the existence of fac- tors which must not &gt;be ignored in ascertaining a fair value of the higher unit values of the entire property and by the existence of a cer- tain value by reason of the fact that this company is organized and operating service in territory well developed. This Question need not be pursued further than to say that in this rate case returns on the out- standing securities will be figured. The company's improvement pro- gram calls for the injection of considerable amounts of new capital on which the company will also be entitled to earn. This question will 'be discussed more fully in another place in this finding. Revenues The actual earned revenues for the past three years and estimate nade in March for the year 1921 may be briefly summarized thus: 1918 1919 1920 1921-es Exchange service $43,876 $47,487 $49,171 |5l,530 Ton service 3,567 3.407 2,885 3,032 Miscellaneous 424 l.oos 9S7 1,036 Total $47,867 $51,902 $53,044 Â»55,5Â»8 The figures representing the 1921 estimated earnings do not take into account the results which might flow from curtailment of frÂ« service and the probable consequent increase in toll earnings if such curtailment lake place. Operating Expenses The company was not in agreement with itself in its application and in exhibits filed at the hearing as to its needs to meet the demands tor proper service, but in testimony it did not emphasize the figures i-arried in the application. The comparative figures set forth by the company are as follows: In Application In exhibits Maintenance $22,536 $28,131 Traffic 21,087 21,466 Commercial 14,597 15.789 Taxes 2,400 2,400 Dividends on fair value of $135,430 10,834 10,834 Total revenues required $71,454 $78,620 </seg>
            <seg id="p304">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 377 It is essential to measure these estimates by the company, pre - sented as they were in testimony, to ascertain whether they were prop - erly supported and are reasonable, expected, necessary expenses. Maintenance Requirements The Commission is accustomed, in measuring the needs of appli - cants, to figure the. maintenance and the reserve to cover unrealized depreciation in one sum against which the company makes the charges :'S they are experienced. The experience of this company for the three m an preceding the hearing compaie with the estimate presented in testi - mony as follows: In considering the statements of the company as to necessary re - quirements tor 1921 the experience of the company of preceding years eannct be ignored. The amounts set fcrth are for the three years 191S to 1920 inclusive and do not. include any reserve accruing to meet future replacements. Whatever the amount so earned for that purpose was erroneously passed by the company to surplus. That such deprecia - tion does take place need not be more 'than stated. That it must be cared for annually is necessary cr in the end the property has worn out and no funds exist for replacements. In the year 1920 the figure is reasonably high regardless cf no depreciation accrual by reason of the fact that there was extensive storm damage, replacement cf which was a proper charge against depreciation reserve, if one had existed. The 1921 estimate, as shown by the testimony, was on the theory that a consid - (rafole amount cf the proposed reconstruction and betterments had al - ready been made and on the further basis of higher requirements for maintenance and depreciation reserve. The full amount cf the latter has never been recognized as essential. The figure presented by the company also exceeds the experience of these large companies in this state which have carefully studied the necessities of keeping property in jrood operating condition end also prctecting the original investment. The following tabulation will show the experience of the Nebraska Tele - phone company, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company and the Monroe Independent Telephone company fcr three years, same being in terms of percentage as con. pared with the fixed property, making no deduction for purposes of comparison on account of non-depreciable fixed property: The percentages above for the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph rom- 1918 15,118 1919 $14,681 1920 $21,037 1921 est $28,131 918 919 Â»20 L.

Such percentage â  has been shown is reasonably liberal when it is remembered that the incc'.n Telephone &amp; Telegraph company strikes a higher percentage y reason of its extensive automatic equipment which raises the main - enance costs and reduces operating or traffic costs.

It proposes to increase the number of operators at Albion by wo; at Newman Grove by two; and to increase the pay of all operator*. It would increase the total operators wages at Albion per annum from $5,040 to $7,460; at Newman Grove from $2,430 to $4,020; at Genoa rrom $2,760 to $3,420; at Monroe from $63o to $9tio ; at Platte Center li-om $660 to $900: and at Tarnov frcm $420 to $4So.

The chief operator at Albion, figured by the company in traffic expense entirely, actually puts in half her time at clerical -work and her pay should be allocated in conse - quence. The rates of pay for operators cannot be lightly overlooked. Before the recent boom in all labor reward many companies notoriously under - paid these girls. The question which arises now, one which is man - agerial in a large extent, and one regulatory' in that the scale of wages must be considered in arriving at proper rates, has to do with general levels of wages and whether those things which go to make up such wages levels justify increases now. This company pays $50 per month for trick operators at Albion: $42.50 per month at Newman Grove: $4&lt;&gt; per month at Genoa; and varying amounts at the smaller exchanges. It pays the chief operator $70 at Albion; $75 at Newman Grove: and $60 at Genoa. It proposes to increase all of these wages about twenty per cent with the exception of the operators at the smaller exchanges where the proposed changes very considerably depend upon the situation. At some points in the state wages are as high as $65 per month or trick operators. These cases are, however, exceptions. In a number of localities $60 is paid, but more commonly not to exceed $40. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company at all exchanges the size ot Genoa. Newman Grove and Albion starts operators at $27 per month and raises them to $47 per month by the end of three years of service. The Nebraska Telephone company, now the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company, at exchanges comparable with the larger ones of appli- cant, begins its operators from $9 to $11.50 per week and by the end ol three years pays from $12.50 to $15.50 per week. The highest rates of I-ay quoted here are in western localities. These large companies are considering the necessity of some wages reductions. The cost of livinii is declining and in so far as increases in wages were commensurate with the ccst of living it is not to be unexpected that they will reducr in the near future. The employing company cannot overlook the ques - tion or living costs. From the regulatory point of view the public is Interested in efficient service at whatever price it can be purchased. While the Commission does not undertake to fix wages for this applicant, consideration of all of the facts warrant it in figuring next year's traffic requirements without increases in wages at the larger exchanges of applicant company other than as required for the employ - ment of an additional operator at Albion, two additional operators at Newman Grove and justified increases in pay to those operators at the small exchanges who have, for unusually low return, been supplying all the help for operating, house rent, light and heat. The company is </seg>
            <seg id="p307">380 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT fully justified in correcting to the advantage of these employes in the smaller towns the wages levels. tFrom a consideration of all the facts the Commission is setting n as the maximum requirement of the company for traffic expenses the year 1921 at the annual rate $16,000. Commercial Expenses t Under this heading is included officers' salaries, clerical force, cosi collecting, rents, office supplies, printing, stationery and such niiscel - eous expenses as are not elsewhere classified. The experience of the company in this division of expenditures for the three war-time years and the estimate for the year 1921. as set forth in March of this year, is as follows : Relative to tlie 1920 expenditure the company alleges the lack of nances prevented the payment of active officers of the company a easonabl? compensation and in part this allegation is borne out by estimony. In making up the estimate for 1921 the company included 3,000 salary each to the secretary and to the president and assistant manager combined, and $2,100 salary to the general manager. It has ncluded in its estimate an additional bookkeeper at $100 per month As heretofore stated the Commission hesitates very much to criticise business arrangements and rates of pay either to employes or office unless it is clearly indicated that other considerations than bu judgment are affecting the results. The Commission is impressed, how ever, in this instance with the fact that this company has no propt managerial head. The president devotes a considerable part of his tin tthe business of the company, more particularly in collections. The retary is so burdened with detail office work as to not have time. ler present arrangements, to oversee the whole distribution territory and traffic arrangements. The so-called general manager appears from the testimony not to be general manager at all but lather local manager at Newman Grove, and devotes almost all ol this time, as shown by the allocation of his wages in 1920. to maintenance and construction work in that locality. The company should make arrangements, and this is urgently recommended, to sive general directory powers to one of the officers save as otherwise ordered by the board of directors, to be in control of the policies of the company. Under present organization it would ap - pear that the present secretary is best qualified for this work. No question in our minds exists that such job is well worth the $3,000 per year proposed. We do not give our approval to the proposed salary to 1918 10,112 i9i:, $11,317 1920 $10,131 1921 esi $15,789 </seg>

The present secretary vill find it impossible to assume wide managerial duties unless relieved of office routine. A man of his capacity ought not to be engaged pri - marily in routine duties and this consideration leads us to approve heartily the proposal of the company to add a bookkeeper to its office lorces. It should relieve the secretary and enable him to devote his time to more comprehensive matters. A comparison of tht- cost of officers and clerical forces, including 1 the cost for billing and collecting, of a considerable number of Ne- braska telephone companies comparable in size with applicant, or larger, together with readjustments of the companies' esimates. to elimi- rate duplication and to eliminate commensurate pay for official position not warranted by duties performed, leads us to the conclusion that an llowance of $8,000 for officers and clerical forces is sufficient. Adding f) that other general expenses which the company may properly expect i? meet, it is the Commission's judgment that $12,000 is an ample allow- nce for total commercial expenditures. Other Deductions The estimate of $2,400 in taxes is not out of line in view of general nc-rease or taxation and a probable increase in valuation of the com - any's property due to the improvement program now in progress. The Commission has already approved stock in amount of $114,025 nd has scrutinized the results from the issuance and sale of $9,700 in notes. The total amount of these securities is $123,725. At the present rime eight per cent return on these securities is not out of line, particu- irly when it is considered that the company has asked no consideration f increased valuation due to higher unit values of all its property when leasured by depreciated existing dollars.

The territory served by this umpany is second to none in the state in general progress. The tele - ilione Service to which the communities are entitled should also be second none. Such is not now the case. This company testified that it pro- D work rapidly tov/ard first class commercial service. It proposes common battery system at Albion and the town is anxious for it.

            <seg id="p311">384 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The company is now engaged in a reconstruction program and is putting into the property the necessary additional cash as the rural construction progresses. It is not unfair to assume that within the next tew months at least $12,000 of new capital will have been added. This assumption will be followed in allowing future dividends under the rate readjustment now proposed and in so far as the investment of capital may foe delayed the dividends thereon ?re to be passed to -urplus and drawn upon only at the regular dividend rate as the money is invested Summary of the Company's Needs From a consideration of the facts Â«et forth above we have the fol lowing Commission estimate of the company's requirements: Maintenance Traffic S21.500 16,000 12,000 Commercial Deductions from operating income: Taxe3 Dividends and interest $2.4nii 10,850 -13,250 Total $62,750 To meet this prcbable experience revenues must be- produced. Tl company estimates that under present rates it will earn Iron: exctoanj xchans: service J4S.il from tolls and from miscellaneous making a total of $52.17 It does not appear unfair to assume that from the operation of gross and net rates and delayed payments by many subscribers, necessitating the application of the gross rates, an additional $2500 will be Â»arned and that from the elimination of certain of the free toll service, which win be approved in this order, $1500 may be earned. Without allowing for rowtth, which may or may not take place, it would appear that the resent revenues will earn approximately $56,000 per annum. Rate read - ustments to make up the deficit are therefore essential. It is, however. o be borne in mind that the increase in expenditures from the experience f 1920 to the estimate by the Commission in 1921 is largely due to wages rovided for operators and linemen, deemed by us essential to proper ervice and to meet the objections which were filed at the time of the earing and frcm time to time informally by subscribers. Free Territory This finding has already set forth the extent of the tree service which </seg>
            <seg id="p312">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 385 subscribers enjoy. With one exception, no other such extensive free service is offered in the state and in that one exception no effort is made to give high class commercial service. Seme other companies, like the Hamilton County Farmers Telephone association and the Dodge County Farmers Telephone company, give free service throughout their own territory but do not extend it to neighboring companies. Long study of extensive free service has convinced the Commission that it actually benefits the few at the expense; of the many. Only rarely will the average citizen at Genoa have occasion to call Petersburg, Closter, or some one on the St. Bernard exchange. (Certain businesses may have frequent use of the service, but when calling such outside exchanges over the free trunk lines intertown service is tied up and cannot be used by subscribers in calls to nearby points within the territory owned by this company. Extensive free service promotes trivial conversation to the disadvantage of important business. In this company's territory this free service is extensively used by non-residents, such as traveling men, and the company is therefore furnishing something for nothing or some - thing at the expense of the subscribers in general and at the same time is seriously interfering with the service of its cwn subscribers. Testi - mony was ample that the free lines are constantly overloaded and busi - ness mU9t be transacted over the pay lines. That such is the case is readily understood. Certain business interests and certain of the outside companies ob - jected to curtailment of free service. The business interests' view point was that if they paid toll it would cost considerably more than any added expense they might be to in the flat rate. The outside companies were chiefly interested because in the interchange of messages the advant - ages are theirs. For instance, messages from the Shell Creek Telephone company to Newman Grove would be much more numerous than mes - sages in 'the opposite direction. Long study of telephone problems has convinced the Commission, and this conviction has been expressed in orders during the past ten years, that free service between exchanges musl 'be reduced to the minimum and at the same time not to seriously interfere with general relations of communities. This applicant desires to retain the free In - terchange between all of its own exchanges. In some respects the Commission considers this of doubtful value. Where free messages go beyond the next exchange they are used but little by the general tele - phone using public. However, for the present the company's application will be approved and the free service between its own exchanges will be continued to subscribers. The company has net followed a vigorous policy of collecting from non-residents who use its free service. It will te ejepected to improve on its practices and secure revenue from these transients in so far as the service can be policed. </seg>
            <seg id="p313">386 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The free service between exchanges of this company and outside companies will be eliminated with two exceptions: (a) No action will be taken en the question of connections between the Skeedce Telephone company and applicant company for a period of sixty days, during which time the two companies will attempt to solve the problem in SUch a manner as Will properly compensate both companies for service rendered end will submit to the Commission for approval the conclusions arrived at. Failing to reach an agreement within sixty days will be sufficient reason for the Commission issuing a supplemental order on this parti - cular'matter; (b) between the Newman Grove exchange of applicant and the Shell Creek Telephone company are many interlacing farm lines en which rural neighbors are given service by different companies.

The Company has been using a differential between gross and net rates on its Albion exchange of fifty cents per month on business Service and fcrty cents per month on all other service.

This stock was disposed of. iPrior to the entering of the Eer in that case (Application No. 4088) ithe Ccmmission had a detailed entory and valuation of the properties made, by its Mgteeers, oa ual cost basis and found properties the original cost of which was $124,365.24, and a present value of approximately $96,000. Obligations authorized at that time amounted to $75,000. Certain improvements have been made to the properties since the issuance of the order mentioned. Tinder date Of December 31, 1920, the company's financial statement Ews gross assets of $121,765.79; liabilities, containing items of depre - ion reserve, of J13.612.49; and a surplus of $14,016.51.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4515 rie Matter Of the Application of the Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha, Limited, to increase loading and unloading charges. OPINION AND FINDIN'C BROWNE, Commissioner: kThis applicant desires to amend its switching: tariff dated May 1. 1896, plement No. 8, and to publish in supplement No. 9 thereto provision t for loading and unloading live stock the charge shall be $1.00 per car. tThe present charge is fifty cents per car. This rate has been in feet for thirty-two years last past, according to the petition, but it is l.eged that for some 'time the charge has been entirely insufficient to cover the cost of the service 'performed. According to applicant, -wages for men employed in 'this work have increased slightly more than one Eidred per cent in the past four years. Exhibits submitted with the lication, covering a period of nine months ending December 31, 1920, w that the actual cost, exclusive of return on the investment in facil - ities and allocated portion of executive office expenses, claims for per - sonal injuries, legal services and collections, amounts to ninety-seven cents per car, of which 78.7 cents is labor item alone. In Order to as - certain this expense the company alleges that for nine months last past it has kept daily work sheets for each employe, on which sheets the time devoted to each class of duties during the day has been carefully re - corded. The carriers have 'been absorbing the unloading charge. Under the terms Of the federal transportation act and under the contract of ship - ments shown in the bill of lading, 'the duty of the carriers is to deliver the stock to the stockyards at Scilth Omaha. A portion of this duty is performed by the stockyards railroad as agent for the carriers. Through long practice, during which time the freight rates on live Stock have de - veloped, the carriers have undertaken the duty of loading and unloading the live stock, hence it would appear that the charges fcr this service </seg>
            <seg id="p320">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 393 are embodied in the freight rate and any allowance made to the applicant for loading and unloading should be absorbed by the carriers. The showing made by applicant as to cost of the service indicates clearly an emergency as defined in section 6131 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha, Limited, be and it hereby is authorized to publish in supplement No. 9 to its switching tariff a charge of $1.00 per car for loading and unloading live stock; provided that said charge shall be collected from the carriers for whom the service is performed.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4519 In the Matter of the Application of the Scribner Artificial Ice Company for Validation of issues of stocks and notes. Appearances: For applicantâ P. L. Bauer, treasurer; For the Commission â B. E. Forbes, chief engineer; O. E. Johnson, accountant. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant is before the Commission for the purpose of making legal certain financial transactions as a public service corporation, en - tered into in the years 1919 and 1920 without due regard to the statutes of the state covering the matters involved. The essential underlying facts may be briefly stated as follows: In 1919 the business interests of Scribner undertook the construction Of an artificial ice plant and formed a corporation for that purpose. Be - cause of very poor electric light service enjoyed (by the town at that </seg>
            <seg id="p321">394 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT time, it was deemed possible 'by the incorporators that an electric light business would ultimately join with the making of ice and, in the articles of incorporation, it was provided that the corporate body might also manufacture and distribute electric current for lighting, power and heat purposes. In its initial stages the corporation was not a public utility, save as provided in the articles of incorporation. In actual practice it was a private business. The first money collected by subscriptions, s-omething more than $20,000, was spent in the construction of the ice plant in 1919. All money put intc the ice plant was secured from the sale of stock one hundred cents on the dollar, with no promotion or selling expense involved. The company made an application to the securities de - partment of the state of Nebraska for validation of this stcck and, ulti - mately after the business had been broadened to include electric public - service, was referred by that department to the State Railway Commission, where application was renewed. In 1920 negotiations were entered into between applicant corporation and the Nebraska Gas &amp; Electric Light company for the purchase of the distributing system cf the latter company in the town of Scribner. The existing property of the gas and electric company was inventoried and priced by engineers for the applicant and the engineer for the Nebraska Gas &amp; Electric company and an agreed report as to the value was sub - mitted to applicant. This report, which used unit values of 1919 as a basis, with full allowance for depreciation, was accepted by applicant as a basis for the purchase of the property, and it was taken over on I hat basis, the price being $7,044.08 Later this was changed slightly and the price paid was $400 less than this figure. After, consulting with attorneys the corporation proceeded to secure bubscriptions for the sale of additional stock with which to improve anil enlarge the generating plant and to motorize the ice plant. It is claimed m by applicant that legal opinion secured by it stated that it was not neces - sary to secure an approval of the stock. It was evidently an off-hand opinion but it lead the applicant intc a plain violation of the stocks and bonds act, to which it pleads guilty, but offers as extenuating circum - stances the uncertain plea of ignorance of the law. A total of $62,800 of stock was sold and issued in this manner and partial payments on a few additional shares of stock was made. This stock is common, cf a par value of $100 per share, and was sold at par. The company installed an internal combustion engine in place of the old engine and added sufficient generators to take care of .growing business. It later determined that the prospects for enlarging its business war - ranted adding to its central power equipment, and a Busch-Sulzer Diesel engine of 165 horse-power was purchased on open contract. To pay for this and to pay the original cost of ithe electric distribution system, the company borrowed $28,000 from local people on two, three and five-year </seg>
            <seg id="p322">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 395 notes unsecured. A part of the application relates to the validation of these notes. The Commission sent its accountant to Scribner to check the various expenditures of the company in order to ascertain whether the money nad been economically spent and whether property was in evidence for the expenditures. The report of the accountant was that the company at the time of the examination, viz., Novem'ber 30, 1920, had gross assets of $80,436.50. This was before the addition of the Busch-Sulzer engine, â which cost the company $22,200, plus the cost of installation. The com - pany has added to its distribution system since the original purchase. Most of the property has, therefore, been constructed during the periods of abnormal prices and, ultimately, very probably from the earnings, the company will find it necessary to write off the excessive construction prices in order that 'the values at any particular moment, under normal conditions, may not be exceeded by the liabilities. The company stands a violator of a Nebraska statute. We are con - vinced that the violation was unintentional but this does not excuse the act. In the past the Commission has constantly held to the position that where the violation was unintentional and the action was conserva - tive and in accordance with good business judgment, no good purpose could come from bringing action for violation. It has in many in - stances validated illegal action where it was possible to do so with just regards for the rights of the public and of the stockholders. There ap - pears to be no reason why precedent should not be followed in this in - stance. The Commission will at this time validate the issue of $62,800 of common stock, par value $100 per share. It will authorize common stock s treasury stock in amount $7,200, which may be sold from time to ime as market affords, the proceeds to be used for the retirement of existing or future indebtedness incurred in the construction program. It will, also, validate the $28,000 of notes at present issued and outstanding on which the company has secured $28,000 in cash and has expended that amount in the acquisition and construction of properties. These ap - provals by the Commission will be made subject to conditions set out in the order be'ow. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that an issue of six hundred and twenty-eight shares, par value 5100 per share, of common stock of the Scri'bner Artificial Ice company, which stock was sold for cash at its face value, be, and it hereby is, valiiated.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as of December 31, 1921, the COm - pany shall report to the Commission a statement of the year's construc - tion program, a balance sheet of that date, and a complete statement of the handling and maintenance and depreciation fund required in the paragraph next above.

OPINION AND FINDING COOK, Commissioner Application is presented by the Farmers Mutual Telephone company Avoca, Nebraska, requesting authority to make certain increase in its rate schedule. The company owns and operates in the village of Avoca switching facilities only. The present rates authorized for the company are as follows: Per Receipts This amount of $1,794 is increased by tolls and otherwise for the year 1920 to $2,304.44, being the total receipts for 1920. The total operating expense for the same period was $2,112.85. This would leave the small amount of $191.59 over operating expenses out of which must be paid maintenance, taxes, interest and dividends, which will be seen at a glance to be inadequate to provide for these items. The report of the company shows a bank indebtedness of over $600, created by expense of replacements and repairs on the plant during the year 1920, which â¢ndebtedness is still owed by this company. The object of the appli - cation by the officers of this company for the small increase of rates is to provide for the payment of this indebtedness and to enable them to build up a small depreciation fund to provide for replacements in the future. If is the opinion of this Commission that, on the showing made in their reports, there should be more revenue received by this company for the purposes set forth. The increased rates asked by the company through this application would produce an additional revenue of about $750 per year. The Commission finds that the operating expense as contemplated for 1921 is exceptionally high, and we hope that some read - justment can 'be worked out whereby the officers, of the company may reduce this expense to an amount more nearly in proportion to the revenues received. With a substantial saving from 'this source, together with the added revenue which will attach by the net and gross schedule under this order, we are convinced that bulge in rates which â will pro - duce about $400 additional revenue per year will, with careful manage- 85 farm swiching ...

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant desires to sell $2,425 of capital stock par value $25 per share, for the purpose of securing funds with -winch to retire existing obligations in the form of notes payable. The company was incorporated January 22. 1902, with an authorized </seg>
            <seg id="p326">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 399 capital of $10,000, of which there is at present outstanding $7,575. From time to time the company has bought in shares of stock, until it now has on hand $600 of stock which is available for re-sale in order to replenish its cash account. It desires to sell all or any part of the re - mainder of its authorized stock. In an order dated Juiy 28, 1920, on Application No. 4230, this Com - mission found that the company had, in the process of growth, kept its depreciation reserve invested in additions and betterments to such an extent that when, toward the end of its eighteen years of existenc, it was found necessary to do extensive reconstruction it did not have liquid assets available, although its reserves, as represented by physical property, were ample. To meet this situation the company borrowed $2300. In its order the Commission found that this borrowed money was theoretically for the purpose of restoring depreciation reserve and to make it available for reconstruction. The order also found that the company should, if it dsired to pay off the indebtedness, arrange to sell additional stock to retire notes, or, if in its judgment it was a better policy, to continue to carry the indebtedness. By the present application the company indicates its desire to â¢ansfer the notes payable to stock liabilities. This is good financing and does not alter the liabilities in any degree. In the opinion of the Commission authorization should be granted, subject to the usual re- . -trietions, the Company being fully advised that it also has in its treas - ury $600 of treasury stock which will likewise be available for sale to store its cash account from which the stock was purchased. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Dawson-Nemaha Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell ninety-seven shares of its common stock r-ar value $25 per share, subject to the following restrictions: The stock shall be sold fcr cash, or its equivalent in property, and at not less than par. From the proceeds the company shall retire an equal amoun' of notes and accounts payable, or in lieu thereof spend any portion o1 the proceeds for betterments and reconstruction, making the proper ac counting entries ito represent the purposes for which the money has been spent. Whenever $1,000, or any multiple thereof, of the stock has been sold and the proceeds expended, the company shall make re - port to the Commission in detail as to the expenditures.

            <seg id="p327">400 APPLICATION NO 4540| In the Matter of the Application of the Republican Valley Telephone Company, of Franklin, Nebraska, to increase its exchange rates. OPINION AND FINDING COOK, Commissioner: The Republican Valley Telephone Company operates an exchange at Franklin, Nebraska, furnishing service to 361 subscribers. Connection with switched lines adds 164 switched subscribers to the service. This company originally operated both in Franklin and Bloomington, but in 1912 a separation of the two exchanges was effected and two companies re-organized. The present owner purchased the Franklin sub-division at that time for the sum of $9,185.00. He later made further Investment in the property amounting to $1,000.00 additional in 1918 and $4,665.00 in 1919, thus bringing the total capital investment to $14,- 850.00 at the present time. The additional investments were made for the purpose of bettering the plant by the installation cf a central energy unit, an improved switchboard and other additions to plant. During the last two years the plant has been further extended and improved, the moneys for this purpose having been secured by assuming notes in the amount of $8,475.00. The applicant states that practically this entire amount entered into the plant, which statement is substantiated by a study of the 1920 records which shows that $7,490.97 was expended in that year for additions and betterments; most of this expenditure resulted from the replacement of aerial lines with underground Cable. From these facts, it appears that the applicant now has a plant, the original cost of which lies between $20,000.00 and $25,000.00 The rates now in effect at this exchange are as follows: Common battery Magneto Bus. Res. Bus. Res. Individaul line $2.75 $1.75 $2.00 $1.50 â Four party harmonic 1.50 Farm 1.25 Desk sets (additional) 25 .25 .25 .25 Extension bells 25 .25 .25 .25 Extension sets 75 .50 .75 .50 The above rates are gross, a 25c discount for all classes of service being allowed for payment in advance.

            <seg id="p328">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 401 Very little information concerning the operating results for the past years is available, because of poorly kept records. The annual re- port of the company for 1920 shows, after the subtraction of certain in- correct items, a net earning of $120.59, no deduction having been made for dividend purposes. However, as this report is largely the result of estimations, further investigation of veatigation resulted in the following the records was made. This in- exhibit of expenses for 1920: Maintenance _ $1,761.18 Traffic expense 1,689.05 Commercial expense 478.36 Taxes and interest _ 771.39 Total expenses $4,699.98 an estimate as no records of line- The maintenance figure is purely men's work or material used had been kept and no accurate allocation of these items could be made. It may be anticipated that this figure will be much higher in 1921. Therefore, in making the following state- ment of anticipated 1921 expenses, an allowance of $2,500.00 for main- tenance and depreciation is substituted: Anticipated Expense for 1921 Maintenance and depreciation J2.50O.0O Traffic 1,689.05 Commercial _ 478.36 Taxes and interest 771.39 8 per cent dividend en $14,850.00 1,188.00 Total estimated charges against income $6,626.80 A large item of expense not included in the above computation, is anticipated by the applicant because of the expected removal of the central office to another location, a change which will be necessary in the near future.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO 4543 in the Matter of the Application of the Campbell Telephone Company for Authority to increase rates. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant operates an exchange of 352 subscribers at Campbell, Ne - braska, under a schedule of rates that has existed for many years, which schedule is quite peculiar to this exchange. It has 258 stockholders and subscribers who are not stockholders. The schedule of rates in existence, which has not been changed dur - ing the high price era, is as follows: For all subscribers to whom the company fur- nishes all service equipment $1.25 per month net For non-stockholders who own their own tele- phone sets 75 per month net For stockholders who own their own telephone sets 50 per month net The outstanding stock amounts to $6775 and notes payable are $820. There has been no valuation of this property by the Commission's engineers and it is impossible to tell either its condition or its value at this time. We do know, however, that due to the rapid development with insufficient capital, the company has allowed all of its properties to run down and service was seriously impaired. The rates charged â were insufficient to maintain a plant after it reached the deteriorated state. Returns to stockholders were made indirectly through a lower rental charge but were not sufficient to encourage non-stockholders to purchase shares of stock. The company is, therefore, at this time, when extensive rebuilding is essential, faced with almost total inability to secure additional capital. To fill the breach an assessment of $10 per share was levied on each stockholder in 1920. Moat of this has been paid and the money has been used to improve the properties. It will no doubt directly reflect in an added value in the hands of stockholders </seg>
            <seg id="p331">404 on which they will be entitled to a return when that value has been fixed by the Commission. The company has asked, through its board of directors, for sharp increases in rates and a spread between business service and other service not heretofore made. A scrutiny of the 1920 experience of the company would indicate it should have had in that year approximately 3750 additional revenue. It may be that close investigation will disclose additional requirements, or may diclose a more favorable situation. The Commission's docket makes it impossible at this time to make the in - vestigation. The company, however, is in need of assistance if it is to properly unction as an independent telephone plant. The beard of directors ask uthority of the Commission to require all non-stockholders to purchase tock in order to secure this additional revenue for improvements. This eing contrary to law, it could net be approved. There is outstanding a ortion of the assessments not yet paid and several hundred dollars of &gt;ack rentals. Every effort should be made by the company to collect hese amounts in order to continue its rebuilding program. tin the meantime the Comissicn will authorize some temporary rates ch may produce for a brief period more revenue than the company ds. It will within the next sixty days carefully survey the property )ugh its engineering department and during the month cf June, 1921, will hold a hearing at Campbell in an endeavor, in conjunction with the board of directors and such subscribers as are interested, to develop a permanent and stable policy of operation. It is to the advantage of the local people that this be done. The rates herein authorized will be for a period of three months. Prior to the termination of that time such readjustment will be made as is found essential, alter careful investigation, ami the rates subse - quent thereto will be on such a level as will probably care for the com - pany. Applicant company asks authority to rebate on the bills to its stock - holders a sufficient amount, monthly, or at the regular payment periods, as will represent a reasonable return on the investment of the stockhold - ers. At this moment the Commission will not authorize such rebate on the $10 assessment because it cannot be said now that this is all represented by property. After the hearing on the permanent rates an equitable E elusion will be reached. The company will be authorized, however, rebate at the rate of ten per cent per annum on the face value of shares outstanding to its stockholders of record, such rebates to be lie at such times as is most convenient to the company. The rates which will be authorized herein will provide an increase In revenues over existing rates of approximately $1400 per annum after </seg>

            <seg id="p333">406 SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Effective May 1, 1921, this Commission authorized certain increases In rates of the Campbell Telephone company, to remain in effect three months. This action was taken because of grave emergencies in the finances of the applicant. The order provided that an investigation of the value of the property would be made and a hearing during the three months' period, which terminates August 1, 1921. Due to press of business, the Commission's engineers and the Com - mission Itself have been unable to make the investigation proposed in the original order herein. .We have before us only the results of op - eration for May under the present rates. WTien adjustments are made for a proper maintenance set-up, it does not appear that the revenues at this time are excessive. For its own convenience the Commission will again extend the rates for three months. It will be provided in this order that a hearing will be held at Campbell, Nebraska, on Wednes - day, September 7, at 9 o'clock a. m., for the purpose of determining more permanent rates and for purposes of ascertaining what may be done to relieve the complex property and rate situation of the applicant com - pany. The Commission will expect the attendance of the full board of directors at that hearing and a full discussion of the problems of the company, in the meantime the Commission's engineers will inventory the property and a copy will be available to the members of the board of directors for their consideration at the time of the hearing. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Campbell Telephone company be, and it hereby is. authorized to continue the temporary rate schedule ordered on April 21. under Application No. 4543, the original order herein, for an additional period of three months, August, September and October. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company file with the Com - mission on or before August 15 monthly financial statements, on uniform blanks furnished for that purpose, of the results of operation for the months of June and July. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall for this tem - porary period increase the set-up for maintenance and depreciation re - serve to $110 per month, such set-up to be used only for the purposes set forth in the uniform rules followed by this company in its accounts. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that hearing, looking to a more per - manent adjustment of the rates and schedules of this company be held at Campbell, Nebraska, beginning at 9 a. m., Wednesday, September 7. in such place as may ibe provided by the board of directors. </seg>

Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4543 In the Matter of the Application of the Campbell Telephone Company for Authority to increase rates. Appearances For applicant â J. W. Worley, secretary and manager; Mabel Worley, bookkeeper Xc respondents. SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: Several months ago this applicant appeared before the Commission and presented evidence of serious financial embarrassment and asked for authority to seek a way out by requiring all subscribers to become rtockhclders. It also asked for increases in rates. An emergency ap - peared to exist and the Commission issued a temporary order, effective May 1, 1921, and directed a physical examination of the property to be made before a final hearing and order. Subsequent to the inventory and valuation hearing was held at Campbell on September 7, 1921. The company was there represented by a majority of its board cf directors, who asked that they be permitted, at least for a longer temporary period, to collect the existing rates. No rescpondents appeared. This case involves the finding of a fair value of applicant's property, well as a measure of reasonable rates. In the early days of the twentieth century telephone service orig - inated in the vicinity of Campbell by the organization of small mutual companies, wherein cash was contributed by each member in propor - tional amount, work was donated and lines were built radiating from the town of Campbell, and a central office was established on a cooperative plr.n, with assessments levied for maintenance and upkeep of lines. In 1907 the company was incorporated, authorized capital stock $7000.00, with an indebtedness limited of $500. wAJl the independent linea were merged into the one corporation and stock of the par value of $25 per share was issued to each of the stockholders in the individual com - pany to represent his cash contributions in his particular original mutual </seg>
            <seg id="p335">408 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT company. The evidence shows that there were some cash adjustments. The company was at this time still a mutual. In common with other companies it found it impracticable to remain a mutual and it has been renting telephones for a number of years. There has grown up a system of rates which is rather cumbersome S&gt;irt to which the officers offer no objection. Stockholders pay one scale of rates; non-stockholder subscribers, who own their drop and instru - ment, pay another scale of rates; and those who are served by the company but who own no property pay a third scale. The company furnishes batteries only to this third class. AH other subscribers, con - rtituting approximately ninety per cent of the total, buy their batteries l'rom the company at cost or slightly more, which cost is additional to the rate paid. It is seen that the outstanding cash capital, amounting- to $6775, represents only the cash which was originally put in in the estimation of those who formed the original company. None of the labor donated, and it constituted a very considerable part of the labor of construction, is represented by capital liabilities, although represented in the assets. The Commission's engineers made an inventory of the property and attached approximate historical construction cost units thereto and for each class of property found a condition per cent. The result was a figure which included certain recognized general expenses which were, in the case of this company, (as was the labor of construction) actually donated in large part. The Commission's engineers found a historical construction cost of $17,522,27, which the department depreciated to $11,965.45. On a basis ol three hundred sixty-five stations, with no real estate owned, it gives a per station value of $32.78 at this time, on the t-ases used by the engineers. kThis is on the basis of actual cost of constructing during the period en this property originated if all work had been hired. It does not lude working capital or any intangible values, such as going concern. The company's statement of assets, as of August 31, 1921, shows fixed plant $11,215.42, to which should be added materials and supplies $327.78. This does not represent the record cost of the property. It does not take into account the early donated labor and the testimony was that for years it was the practice of the company annually to de - preciate the assets, so, in a measure, this represents a depreciated book value as kept 'by the company. The failure of the company to take into account the early donated labor is partly offset, according to the evi - dence, by its applying depreciation at a slower rate than the engineers find was taking place. This company is entitled to certain recognition of present values in excess of those which the property cost, although it is not asking </seg>
            <seg id="p336">409 for such consideration. It is entitled to working capital. Its working capital must be in part measured by the level of outstanding accounts and by the advance payments. From the record before us H is a con - c.usion of the Commission that sufficient going value has been included by the Commission's engineers in the percentage condition allowed of property practically worn out but more valuable as a part of the planl than as salvage. To illustrate this the Commission's engineers allowed a value of $129.38 for switchboard and accessories which the company soon thereafter said for $50. Due to its extension over too wide a territory for the amount of cash invested, and possibly to the level of rates not permitting the accrual of depreciation funds, the stockholders found it necessary about a year ago to put $10 additional cash for each share into the plant. Hence, the cash, contribution now stands at $35 per share and the donated work represents the additional value. From all the facts considered here we find the fair value of this applicant's property, as of September 1, 1921, to be $13,500. The attention of the directors is called at this time to the fact that the articles of incorporation limits indebtedness to $500, whereas the company now owes ?800 in notes. This situation should be corrected at the earliest convenient moment, either by reducing the indebtedness or amending the articles of incorporation. These articles can Ibe amended by a two-thirds vote of the stockholders. The present possible revenues of the company from the rates tem - porarily authorized are $4830 from subscribers' service and a possibility of some additional earnings from miscellaneous and toll. The record on toll revenue is obscure, both in the record and in the reports to the Commission. It is possible that the company allows the operators, the toll commissions as additional compensation. If so, the practice should be changed to the extent that these revenues should show in total revenues and the extra expenditures should appear in operators' wages. Expenditures The persent rates have been in effect since May 1, 1921, and we have before us the record of the company for the months of May to August, inclusive, cnly. The valuation made by the Commission indicates quite clearly that the company has not, under instructions from the Com - mission, been setting aside a sufficient amount for maintenance. That set-up was $80 per month. Even by the close economy, which char - acterizes the operation of this property, the company has spent in actual maintenance about $250 more in seven months than the set-up and has accrued nothing for depreciation or extraordinary repairs. Such an accrual is essential to the proper functioning of telephone companies and </seg>
            <seg id="p337">410 the order herein will require a larger amount of the revenues to be set aside monthly for maintenance purposes. The company now pays it? manager $125 per month as lineman and manager and $12 per month as secretary for the company. It hires such extra help as is necessary. Its operators at this time cost $100 per month, with the possibility of some emoluments on the side. It pays $16 per month rent and hires a â¢very energetic bookkeeper lor $20 per month. It is an economically operated company. We come now to the question of diverse rates for different classes Of subscribers. Certainly the stockholder who has an investment of al - most $50 per share in the property cught not to pay the same rate as a on-stockholder and no subscriber who furnishes the equipment of drop nd instrument should have a total expense as great as the subscriber who furnishes nothing. The company does not care at this time to ae - uire the telephone instruments and drops &lt; f the majority of those who wn them and the Commission will not insist upon it. The practice has &gt;een to rebate a portion of the rate to represent the difference in the alue of the service performed. \W think that a cash payment as divi - dends to those to whom it is due at stated intervals is preferable. The order will, however, leave it optional with the directors which course to pursue, whether to rebate at regular rental payment times on a fix&lt;e rate per annum, or to collect the full amount and at stated intervals pay a cash dividend. The practice has been for all those who own their BÂ«toeriber sets to buy their own batteries. This is to some criticism from service point of view because some subscribers do not properly keep their bat - teries vigorous. The Commission strongly recommends that the com - pany buy and install all batteries as needed, but the order will not re - quire this to be done at this time. The board of directors will care - fully weigh this matter and adept such plan as seems best in view &lt;&gt;! the recommendation. The rates will take into account this option to the board of directors and the company will be required to file with the Commission a statement of which option it elects to follow, viz.: first, the company to furnish the batteries or not: and second, whether re - bates will be made from bills of subscribers at stated intervals or cash payments as dividends be made. b There are 56 subscribers who own no telephone property; 51 who l their subscribers sets and drops but no stock: and 257 who own h stock and subscribers sets and drops. We find that the subscriber who owns no stcck but who does own his. subscriber set and drop is entitled to a rate of $1.50 per annum less than b subscriber who owns no telephone property and $2.50 per annum less le subscriber also furnishes his own batteries. The stockholder is tied to the same difference in the rates as compared with the sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p338">411 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION eriber who owns no telephone property and to $4.00 per annum either is rebate, which we do not recommend, or as a cash dividend to be paid at intervale named by the board of directors. With rates thus adjusted we find that the company can pay its present operating expenses, taxes and either allow the rebates or the cash dividends and have a surplus around $100 per annum. If the com - pany actually earns some toll revenue which is not immediately allowed as a part of the operators' wages the amount of the toll earnings will De an additional surplus. The situation does not warrant any change in the rates and we agree with the board of directors of applicant com - pany in this respect. We will again scrutinize the results of these rates prior tc July 1, 1922. for the purpose of ascertaining the results Of operat - ing under the subjoined scale. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission, effective November 1, 1921, that the Campbell Telephone com - pany be and it hereby is authorized to publish and collect the following ale of rates Individual business $2.00 per month Party line business 1.75 Individual residence 1.50 " Party line and farm residence - 1.40 " From the above rates the company shall deduct for those who own their own subscriber sets at the following rate per annum, the deductions to be made as most convenient to the company: (a) If the company furnishes subscribers' bat- teries $1.50 per annum (bl If subscriber furnishes his own batteries... 2.50 " IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall pay to the stockholders, in addition to the allowanre for ownership of certain prop - erty, not more than $4.00 per annum per share, either to be paid in cash at such intervals as the board of directors may select, or as deductions from the bills, additicnal to the deductions set out above because of ownership of telephone sobscribers sets.

Smith, engineer; Harry W. Shackelford, attorney TEMPORARY OPINION AND FINI)1N( BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing in the offices of the Commission at Lincoln on April 22, 1921, on application for authority to issue $250,000 HI f common stock for purposes of refunding existing indebtedness against he properties of applicant, to represent additional equities in the prop - rty above the indebtedness, and to take care of a contemplated build - ng program. In support of the application petitioner presented an in - entcry of the property, based on prices as of the first of 1921, which nventory was indefinite in detail as to the quantities of the property in he town distribution plants and generating system. The Commission ound it necessary for its own engineers to check all the property in the eld and present an inventory to the Commission, based not en present prices but on prices of materials and of labor as reasonably experienced at the time the construction was made. The company's inventory contained additional thereto such general items as engineering, supervision, financing, good will and franchise. The Commission's engineers presented additional items covering engin - eering, supervision and interest during the period of construction. In common with the ordinary practice of the Commission's engineers no r; was made to deal with the questions of good will, going value and of financing. Applicant has requested opportunity of cross-examining the Com - mission's engineers upon the presentation as an exhibit for the Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p340">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 413 mission of the inventory made by the engineering department. Date for this examination is hereby fixed for 9:30 a. m. Friday, July 22, 1921. In the meantime the company has a reconstruction program ahead of it, some of the work already having been done and progress on the re - mainder being urgent. It has, therefore, filed a supplemental applica - tion asking for authority to issue $75,000 of stock with the proceeds of which to refund most of the existing indebtedness and to secure funds from the sale of other portions for the reconstruction and alternations program. It urges that such amount would fall well within the most conservative estimate of the value of the properties and will, as a tem - porary expedient, be of great benefit to the company. The Commission will not go into the question so fully at this time as :t will la the final order in the case. Suffice it at this time to say that applicant is a Nebraska corporation, incorpcrated June 10, 1920, with an authorized capital of $300,000 of common stock and with the light to incur debts not to exceed two-thirds of the outstanding capital. It has made a contract of purchase with the Platte Valley Power company of Delaware, which company, through a subsidiary engineering concern, built most of the property embodied in this application. Financial exigencies made it impossible for the Delaware corporation to continue in business and creditors, who comprised all of- the present board of directors, have undertaken, by a reorganization, to put the company on its financial feet, to purchase current from the Nebraska Power company at Omaha and to serve not only the six towns in which distributions sys - tems exist but a large number of rural patrons as well. The new cor - poration has undertaken to take over all of the assets of the foreign cor - poration and its liabilities. These liabilities as of date February 28, 1921, are listed as follows: Notes payable to bankers $23,427.31 The authorized bond issue is $62,000. of which $56,500 is treasury bonds used as collateral to secure the notes to bankers and customers Most of the capital stock is likewise hypothecated. The testimony in - dicated that no fair information exists in the records of the foreign cor - poration, predecessor of the applicant, as to how and for what purposes the capital stock was issued. It is closely held, mosit of it belonging to Anton Bortenlanger. one of the board of directors of the applicant.

Arrangements have been made whereby a large proportion of the existing obligations, secured and unsecured, will be taken up through the issuance of the common stock of the company at not more than par for par. Since the hearing in this case the company has disposed Of a generat - ng plant and distribution system in the town of Arlington. Taking that act into account as near as may be without additional testimony and iminating for the moment all items of going value, value Of leases, ngineering, supervision and financing we find that the company's own stimate of the reproduction cost of labor and materials is $97,035 as f date January 1, 1921, and that the depreciated reproduction cost of aterials and labor is $74,664. The Commission's engineers used dif - erent units, attempting as near as they might to take the experienced cst of tooth labor and materials, a large part of which represented ertain war-time increases. Eliminating the same items from the eng - neers' inventory as near as may be without additional hearing we find le reproduction cost of labor and materials $82,155 and depreciated re- production value $72,633. The Commission's engineers found the prop - erty to be in considerably better condition than the company estimated. The Commission does not in this preliminary order care to discuss the additional values in this property other than to say that additional values representing going value, engineering, supervision during construction, interest during construction and cost of securing franchises and leases must be taken into consideration in the final conclusions as to the fair value ofthe property which the company is entitled to capitalize We are at the moment only concerned with the use of a yard stick to ascer - tain whether the supplemental application can be safely acted upon be - fore the conclusion of the case. It is our conclusion that this can be done with certain reservations, viz,: The company will be required: To keep a careful record of the property shewn in its inventory which may be displaced during the rebuilding program. LTo keep record of the costs of properties which may be added be - re the final determination of the case: tTo secure in the progress of the finding proceedings the released lateral and hold it in trust pending the final determination of the e. </seg>
            <seg id="p342">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 415 The company will make it clear to those who purchase any of the ?75,00O of stock, either tor cash cr in surrender of claims, that other stock may be sold for betterments and that whatever reasonable values may be found in the property over and above the senior obligations and the costs of betterments may be represented by stock issued to those who hold the junior stock obligations of the original company in return lor the surrender of that stock and its cancellation. Under date of October 21, 1920, the Commission authorized this applicant to issue and sell $50,000 of common stock for betterments only and to use none ol the proceeds from the sale of the stock for funding of obligations of the predecessor company. So far as the records of the Commission reveal none of this stock has been sold as the terms re- Quired reports of sales cf this stock and none have been filed. This order, carried under designation Application No. 4383, will be cancelled save only such portions of the stock issue authorized as may have been sold and not reported. Or. in lieu of this action, the company, may, by - filing with the Commission a statement to that effect, substitute the 160,000 authorized in 1920 as a portion of the $75,000 herein authorized the proceeds for the purposes set forth in this temporary order. ORDER T IS THEREFORE ORQERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - lon that the Platte Valley Power Company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell seven hundred fifty shares of its common stock, par value $100 per share, said stock to be sold at not less than unless by supplemental order the Commission authorizes- a de- parture therefrom. The proceeds from the sale of this stock may be used to retire exist - ing notes and accounts payable at par for par or to pay overdue in - terest on notes to secure cash for the improvement program. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in so far as existing indebtedness is paid, either in cash or by stock, whatever collateral securities are held by the creditors, same being obligations against the property, shall be released to the officers of applicant company and held by them in trust pendins: the final conclusion of this case.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: tThis action is brought before the Commission on petition of this &gt;licant under the provisions of article 18 of the Revised Statutes Nebraska for 1913. It -was first presented under Application Xo. 43S3 in the early fall of 1920, order oa Â»viii&lt; h application was issued under date of October 21, 1920. A plan outlined in that order was not ef - fective and applicant ag-ain appear* 1 '! on March 26, 1P21, with a revised plan of financing, its application b^ii.g known as A-434C. in the records tthe Commission. Three separate hearings have been held and an ler for temporary financing was issued under dat â _Â» of July 13, 1921. e matter is before us for final determination. t Applicant is a utility, generating electricity in a power plant at ley, Nebraska, purchasing a portion of the current which it offers sale from the Nebraska Power company of Omaha, transmitting such electric current, manufactured and bought, by means of high tension transmission lines and distributing and selling the same in the towns f Bennington, Elkhorn, Waterloo, Valley and Yutan, as well as to arious rural patrons. Originally this was a Delaware corporation, sup - rvision over the issues of whose securities was not under this Com - mission. As stated in the temporary order, financial exigencies made . impossible for the Delaware corporation to continue in business and arious creditors undertook by reorganization to put the company on s financial feet, to render more stable and long time such existing bligations as could not be converted into stock and to develop the erritory being served. All the present board of directors represented reditors. iA new corporation was formed under the Nebraska laws, its rticles toeing dated June 10, 1920, and filed with the secretary of state uly 16, 1920. Its authorized capital is $300,000 of common stock, with. the right 'to incur indebtedness not to exceed two-thirds of the con - temporaneous outstanding stock. Under the old corporation there was Eued to promoters and others $72,500 in stock. There was also uttered â¢ee trust deeds covering; three different portions of the property, der which trust deeds three series of six per cent bonds, known as APPLICATION NO. 4546 </seg>
            <seg id="p344">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 417 series A, B, and C, were issued, and by the terms of the underlying mortgage these bonds were placed in the hands of a trustee and were issued in payment for construction from time to time. The bonds were in turn hypothecated to secure additional funds for construction. Much of the outstanding stock was likewise used as collateral. There was sold for cash to the public only $5500 of the bonds. The temporary order herein authorized the company to issue and sell 750 shares of common stock, par value $100 per share, at par, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission in separate proceeding. The proceeds from the sale of the stock was to be used to retire existing notes, accounts payable, par for par, pay overdue interest on notes, and to secure cash for an improvement program. The company was also authorized to exchange stock of the new corporation at not more than par far fl^ffor existing indebtedness and in so far as this was done the underlying collateral, released thereby, either bonds cr stock, was to be held by the company pending the final conclusion of the case. The balance sheet of the company, under date of October 1, 1921, reads as follows: Mortgage account, village of Valley, Nebraska 5,505.40 Accrued interestâ notes payable (nonei Depreciation reserve 22,288.00 Capital and Surplus: Capital stock â $72,500.00 Surplus 3.021.48â 75,521.48 $178,404.01 urrent Assets: Cash $ 1,486.12 Accounts receivable â . 5.238.78 Material and supplies '. 2,500.00 ixed Assets: Property plant and equipment 153,198.10 Good will, franchises, etc 14,030.00 ither Assets: Stock in other' concerns 650.00 Unexpired insurance 201.01 Petty cash 100.00 Notes receivable 1,000.00 $178,404.01 iabilities: Notes payable to bankers $ 15,660.94 Trade notes payable _ 8, 163. 84 Notes payable to customers 24,250.92 Acciunts payable 20,446.70 Six per cent bond issue less $62,000 Given as collateral security 56,500 ___^_ iOn notes payable . _ 5,500.00 Meter deposits 1,066.73 </seg>
            <seg id="p345">418 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Under the reorganization agreement the outstanding obligations, amounting to $68,522.40 as shown by the above balance sheet, were either to be paid off through sale of stock or were to be liquidated through issues of stock dollar for dollar. After this was done whatever equities still remained in the property were to be represented by proper issus of stock in the new company not exceeding the equity in exchange for all stock in the Delaware corporation, which stock was to be cancelled. LThe conclusion of the reorganization was dependent upon final de - lination of the value of the property in order that the equities might be fairly determined. To this end the company made an inventory of its property and set against such inventory values as of May 1, 1921, sub - tracted therefrom the depreciation which it deemed to exist, and added thereto other elements going to make up fair value in its estimation. The Commission sent its engineer to inventory the property and directed the engineer to place against such inventory the original cost of the property, as near as the same could be ascertained, and where the cost could not be ascertained reasonable costs as of the date of in - stallation. The engineer also expressed in dollars and cents his judg - ment of existing depreciation of all elements entering into the property and added thereto the amount found by the engineers from many studies of experienced general costs, such as supervision and superintendence of construction, interest daring construction, organization and contingencies. Some discrepancies existed as to the quantities arrived at by the Commission's engineer and that of the icnipanv and an adjournment of the hearing was taken in order than an effort might be made to have the parties get together on the quantities. It was not asked that they Eree as to unit prices because the company was using prices as Of May 1921. and the Commission's engineer was using pric.'s as o! tht- various tes of property construction. Of all the property owned by the company at this time the distrilm- Kn system at Bennington is seven or eight years old and that at Valley ?htly older. Practically a'.l the rest of the property was built in 1918 and 1919 and the Ccmmissicn's engineer used the quite inflated prices of 1919, which the company paid for its construction. So well did the Commission's engineer and the company's engineer *et together that at the time of the last hearing on October 29, 1921, it was stated of record by the manager of the company that on the whole he had no fault to find with the quantities as offered by the Commis - sion's engineer and was satisfied with the values appended to the physi - cal property. In the company's estimation- some items were undervalued and ethers were liberally valued so that the composite result was satis - factory. The record appears e'ear that the company abandoned its demand for a valuation based on price levels of May 1. 1921. and ac- </seg>

Nor was this a surrender on the part of the company. A com - parative statement cf the two inventories of the physical property shows at follows: Commission's engineer's original cost I $98,765 Company's reproduction cost X 98,535 Commission's engineer's depreciated original ibosi 86,150 86,150 Company's depreciated reproduction cost .../. 75,364 \ These totals do not .include the value of right-of-way, franchise and going value, and general overhead expenditures. The three items just mentioned were handled by the parties to the inventory as follows: Commission's Company's Engineer Engineer Reproduc- Original Depreciated Reproduc- tion cost cost cost tion cost depre- ciated Right-of-way $ 1.500 $ 1,500 Franchise, going vaiue etc .... 12,224 12,224 General overhead expenses ....$14,815 $12,773 40,095 40,095 We will discuss these three items in their order. (a) Right-of-way. The Commission's engineer did not include rights - of-way costs. Those were leaseholds and not ownership. The company has presented in Exhibit No. 6 proof that the rights-of-way cost not less than $595 in cash. No question exists but that value exists in these rights-of-way. which if not obtained in the manner they were obtained would have been secured through condemnation proceedings. The com - pany lays claim to a value of $1500, but does not emphasize the amount nor support it by other evidence than what alternative methods of rout - ing would ha.ve meant in the amount of construction. These alterna - tives would not have been necessary for the company has the right of eminent domain. In our estimateion the cost of condemnation would not have exceeded $1000 and we allow that amount in the valuation. (b) Franchise, going value, etc. The company lays claim to $12,224, as the sum total -of these items and includes specifically in this $2460 as the value of franchises. No specific method was employed by the company in reaching these conclusions. The value of the franchises was based on an arbitrary amount per patron attached to the plant in each of the towns. The going value, it was testified, was merely a matter of business judgment on the part of the witness, the manager of the company. There is no question but that the securing of a franchise costs money. It was necessary to consult with members of the city councils and spend time in securing favorable action, all of which cost </seg>
            <seg id="p347">420 the company money which might otherwise have been available for other purposes. No proof was submitted as to the actual cost. We will con - sider the ccst of these franchises with the going value. It is not necessary to enter into an extensive discussion at this time of what constitutes going value and the weight to be given to the various elements, much as the price over and aibove the actual value of the physi - cal units which a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller of this property, the added value obtaining by reason of the fact that the various units are coordinated into a working economical whole, the cost of at - taching 'business to the property, and the value existing by reason of per - fected organizations, working effectively and economically. They all play a part in the final judgment as to what constitutes going value. If the factor of the added 'price the willing buyer would pay the willing seller were given strong prominence in this case, it would hardly be fair to the company because it is passing through a period of financial diffi - culties during which it would not have been easy to secure a reasonable price. No facts were presented to the Commission as to the cost of attaching business, although such cost we know exists. From what has previously been stated, it is shown that for the full value of the physical property alone the Commission's engineer and the company's engineer were practically agreed. The Commission's engineer, however, found less depreciation than did the company's engineer, pres - ent value as ascertained by the Commission's engineer being more than 510,000 greater than that found by the company's engineer. The Com - mission's engineer, in arriving at present worth of physical units, uses a minimum service value below which he dees not go. Even though the unit itself may be about to be displaced and the junk value of the unit being considerably below the figure used by the engineer it may well be Said that the engineer, consciously or unconsciously, takes into account that the unit, so long as it is a part of the whole property, is a different element than it is when displaced, since being badly worn it becomes junk when displaced. It is a working unit before being displaced. Here we think lies one of the prominent elements going to make UP going value in so far as found in the engineer's figures of present value. Ap - parently the company's engineer did not use the same methods or his present value would have been a higher figure. We find that the going value and franchise cost together to bp worth what the company alleges, or $12,000, but do not find that this figure should attach to the present value found by the Commissions engineer because in our judgment there would be a definite dupliration. We will, however, add the $12,000 to the present value of physical units found 'by the company's engineer in Exhibit No. 3. (c) General expenditures, including organization, legal, engineering, supervision, contingencies and interest during construction. The Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p348">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 421 mission's engineer, although stating these items separately, considers them as inseparable part of the physical unit cost and therefore de - preciates at the same rate he depreciates the composite physical prop - erty. Hhe has stated the general expenditures in the column denoted original cost at $14,815 and depreciated the amount to $12,773, being fifteen per cent of the bare bones cost found by him. The company's engineer lays claim to twenty per cent in the same manner and does not depreciate the twenty per cent. The company lays claim, also, to another twenty per cent as the cost of obtaining money and desires to add that in the valuation. In keeping with our findings in a large num - ber of cases we approve the fifteen per cent used by the Commission's engineeY and consider it ample under the particular circumstances sur - roundinp the development of this company. It does not reperesent proven costs, but reperesents reasonable expenditures which might have been incurred if paid separatel yand charged against capital rather than have been paid out of operating revenues. This is not an injustice to the patron because had the general expenditures been charged against capital there would have remained additional net earnings for pay - ment of dividends and this company did not pay dividends in its early lays We consider the twenty per cent, used 'by the company as a basis of cost of getting money, as excessive. If that figure includes exper ieneed discount at which securities were sold such discount would properly have been amortized over a reasonable period. If it repre - sents commissions to brokers it would appear as definite a charge against capital as the lees paid to lawyers or supervising engineers In arriving at a fair figure for this financing it must not be forgotten that this company was developing in a territory which was anxious for electric service and where the local patrons joined in and subscribee funds and aided in the financing. The record is clear on this for neither the bonds nor the capital stock issued 'by the predecessor company in any considerable degree was sold to the public. The money was loanei on account and on notes by customers, banks and others. The author ized securities were largely used as collateral. Wp find a reasonable amount to add in arriving at a fair value for general expenditures and the cost of financing $17,750. We find the fair amount of working capital to 'be $3000, exclusive of materials and supplies reasonably required at all times, â which ma - terials and supplies have been included in previous items. From all of these we arrive at a fair value of the company's prop - prcv $108,100. To this should be added other assets shown on the bal - ance sheet of October 1, 1921, in amount $1950. Taking the liabilities as they exist we have a constructive net bal - ance sheet as of October 1, 1921, briefly as follows: </seg>

            <seg id="p350">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 423 Under the reorganization agreement stated of record, to which all principal parties of the predecessor company are parties, the senior obligations of the predecessor company, assumed by the new corpora - tion in the agreement to take over the properties, are to be handled first and the value cf the outstanding stock, most of which has been held as collateral by creditors, is to be governed entirely by the fair value found by the Commission. From the constructive balance sheet above it will be seen that the $72,500 of stock issued by the predecessor com - pany is represented by property not exceeding $28,970 in value. Nobody knows what consideration was given for the stock of the old company. One man, now dead, was chiefly responsible for the development. He kept most of his transactions in his head. Nor were substantial record of costs kept and the consideration of this case was perforce base&lt;l on the property in existence and fair values thereof. The completion ot the transfer of property to the new corporation has, we understand, been delayed awaiting results of this action. Final action under this order will be withheld until a merchantable title to the leal estate has been presented, passed upon by counsel for applicant, deed secured, and a bill of sale agreed upon for the personal property. Proof that the negotiations of transfer have been completed shall be filed with the Commission before stock is delivered. By the terms of the temporary order, whenever collateral bonds Hid stock of the predecessor company are released from the hands of creditors in the process of refinancing such stock and bonds are to be hold by applicant, pending final conclusions in the case. In the re - ftnani ing the $5500 of six per cent bonds in the hands of the public will be exchanged, according to testimony, for stock in the new corporation, dollar for dollar. Excepc in so far as some of these bonds may still be held as collateral they will be at once in the hands of applicant. "When all have been released the company might cancel the trust deed and retire the bonds, leaving the way free for a new mortgage to secure funds for future improvements, or these bonds might be retained in the treasury to be sold later for proper purposes. The company had no settled plan at the time of the hearing. A condition of this order will be that before any final disposition of these bonds, or any portion of them, is made, the company take the matter up with the Commission and set forth its matured p'an. A further condition will be that in the final transfer of the property to the new corporation the stock of the pre - decessor company shall he cancelled. Applicant will be authorized to issue and sell common stock for cash at par for the puipose of retiring indebtedness- and making im - provements, or exchange dollar for dollar for existing legitimate short - time indebtedness, as it will be assumed by applicant in the transfer of property.

            <seg id="p352">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 425 APPLICATION NO. 4553 In the Matter of the Application of the Hazard Telephone Company for authority to increase rates. Appearances : For applicant â G. C. Frink, manager, and Olive Miller, accountant. OPINION AND FINDING COOK, Commissioner The applicant operates a telephone company at Hazard, Nebraska, and territory immediately around the village, serving about 1G0 sub - scribers, which are divided as follows: 9 business phones, 18 residence phones, and 133 farm stations, most all of the subscribers being stock - holders in said company. The company was organized in 1909 and has operated during ttÂ» entire life with very low rates, charging at this time $1.25 per month for all classes of service. It has been operating for the last year â without the services of a manager or regular lineman. On May 1, 1921, G. C. Frink was made manager, acting also in the capacity of lineman, for â which he is to receive $100 per month. One chief, operator was secured at a salary of $95 per month, out of which she is to pay the extra operator's required. At the time Mr. Frink took charge of the company there was no regular set of books being kept of the receipts and disbursements. The company procured the services of Olive Miller of Gibbon, Nebraska, an experienced telephone accountant. She made a study of the conditions of the Hazard Telephone company, going through the flies and all papers that could be found with the following results: Her investigation showed a book value of $6,200 with an outstanding rtock issue of $3,200, on which no dividends have been paid for the year ]920. Her investigation also showed that the company owed bills and notes at bank amounting to $2,500, with uncollected accounts of about $1,800, and no material and supplies on hand. This condition would fore - cast a debt of $800 against the company, provided the uncollected ac - counts can be realized on in full. The company Is asking this Com - mission to allow it to charge a rate of $18 per year for all classes of service, which would be an advance of twenty-five cents per month per station for all phones. The new rate, including tolls, would produce- ap - proximately $3,000 revenue per year. A forecast of the expenses for operation for one year would amount to $3,500, made up as follows: Maintenance, material and depreciation $ 500.00 Two operators at $95 per month 1,140.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p353">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 426 $3,500.00 The Commission is satisfied that the rate requested by the com - pany of $18 per year per station will not produce revenue sufficient to maintain and operate the company's plant and provide for a maintenance and depreciation fund of ten per cent on $6,20Â© estimated value of the plant on account of the small number of subscribers, but are willing t grant the request ;ind trusts that there may be some economies prac - ed whereby it may be able to maintain a satisfactory service for the &gt;scribers. The Commission after giving due notice to all interested parties held t public hearing at Hazard. Nebraska, June 21, 1921, which was at - ided by subscribers of the company.

OPINION' AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: After hearing and careful investigation the Commission issued an order, effective January 1, 1920, authorizing increases in rates to meet exigencies, same to remain in effect for a period of four month3, and at the conclusion of that period, on showing made by the company, con - tinued the rates in effect indefinitely. On the showing mail*.- in the orig - inal case the Commission figured revenues of approximately $4500, which were later increased by authorizing a rate for desk sets. Iu that order it was stated that the exchange was in a lively and growing town and that the revenues for 1920 would probably considerably exceed the estimate. Under date of March 31, 1921, the company presented a showing for the year 1920, indicating total revenues of $596S, showing that either the number of subscribers presented by the company for the original case was erroneous, or that there has been a very healthy growth. The expenditures, except for maintenance, approximated the estimate of the Commission. The company new desires to reduce its rates sufficient to reduce the income about $400 per year. In l!Â»2t&gt;. accounts based on the Commission's accounting system the company showed a profit of |1008. Dividends at eight per cent were paid on $4500. On an allowance of $1400 per annum for maintenance and depreciation the company actually spent more than tho total allow - ance, with nothing as a reserve against unrealized depreciation. The anniuil report indicates that $450 was added to the capital account. No dividends were paid on this $450 and it is assumed that it was put in in the later part of 1920. For 1921 the company is entitled to earn at eight per cent on the total capital outstanding and thu interest on the bills payable and notes payable. It should transfer from its surplus ac - count for the year's business $300 to the depreciation re; ! ervi: account tor the careful protection of its properties. Even when that is done the company will be able to stand the reduction asked for. In this order the Commission will require for the remainder of the year 1921, follow - ing the effective date of this order, that the set up for maintenance and depreciation shall be on the basis of $1620 per annum in place of $1400 per annum. The company is to be congratulated on the very efficient manner in which it is operating its exchange and the arrangements made toy which it has been able to operate at less expense than most other ex- </seg>

            <seg id="p356">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 429 APPLICATION NO. 4557 In the Matter of the Application of the Bloomington Telephone company for authority to increase its exchange rates. OPINION AND FINDING COOK, Commissioner The Bloomington Telephone company operates an exchange at Bloomington, Nebraska, furnishing service to 245 subscribers and giving switching service to eight farm lines having thereon 125 switched sub - scribers. This company was originally incorporated as the Franklin Telephone company, which in 1912 became separated into two smaller organizations known as the Republican Valley Telephone company and the Bloomington Telephone company. The Bloomington Telephone com - pany was organized with an original capital stock of $8,000.00, which also represented the investment in the properties at Bloomington. The engineering department of the Commission found this property to be worth $9,695.00 net, the original cost of the property being placed at ap - proximately $13,000.00. As this valuation was made in 1911 there is no way of definitely as- certaining the present value of the property without taking an actual physical valuation of this date. Therefore, the return which should accrue to the company will be based on the sacrifice of the stockholders rather than the present fair value. In determining the sacrifice of stock - holders, consideration should be given to the fact that no dividends have been paid since the organization of this company in 1912. Therefore, allowing a seven per cent return on $8,000.00, the original stock of the company, not taking into consideration additions and betterments since the date of the Commission's valuation in 1911, at simple interest, the itockholders may be considered as now having an equity in the prop - erty in the amount of $12,480.00. The stockholders should therefore be allowed a return upon this amount at the rate of eight per cent, which the Commission believes, represents a reasonable return considering the present high interest rates prevailing. The increment in stock - l.oldrs' sacrifice at the rate of seven per cent is based on average In - terest rates over a period of several years. The applicant while asking for a twenty-five cent increase of its gross rates for most classes of service, has applied for no increase in the net rate for business or residence individual service, but the sched - ule of rates applied for sets forth an increase of fifty cents gross and twenty-five cents net for farm service, and thirty-five cents gross and twenty-five cents net for switching service. The only objection to these increases filed with the Commission, is that of the Nebraska &amp; Kansas Telephone association, a switched line connected with the Bloomington exchange. Two objections made by this company assert that the ad - vance requested is excessive and represnts discrimination in that a </seg>
            <seg id="p357">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 430 similar percentage of advance has not been made for business service. The first of these objections does not stand against the evidence shown 'by actual accounting studies which, have been made by the Commission relative to the cost of furnishing such service, and the second of these objections -would require considerable supporting â¢evidence, for the experience of the Commission indicates that discrimination actually has been eliminated by the disproportionate increases in switching rates, as a more equitable spread results therefrom. However, a third objection, that due to a shortage of operators the service has not been properly handled, may be a valid objection, and it is advised that the company carry out its suggested plan to engage another operator. The applicant anticipates that an additional expense of $420.00 for this extra operator should be taken into consideration, and such expense will therefore be allowed in anticipating 1921 expenses with the understanding that the operator will be engaged at an early date. A statement has been prepared by the accounting department of the Commission which shows the anticipated earnings and expenses of the applicant for the year 1921. This statement is to a large extent merely a projection of 1920 earnings and expenses with some additions and changes that may be reasonably expected to occur. The maintenance and depreciation item cf $1,500.00 represents a slight reduction of the actual maintenance expenses for the past fifteen months, which reduc - tion has been predicted in view of the fact that labor and material ex - pense is now on the decline or at least at its high-water mark. The prepared statement follows: Anticipated Expenses for 1921 Total anticipated expense for 1921 $5,466.00 Anticipated earnings for 1921 If old rates should con tinue in effect Anticipated deficit for 1921 The schedule of rates applied for will bring additional revenues in the amount of about $650.00 per annum exclusive of any increases which may result from failure on the part of some subscribers to take ad - vantage of the net rate. It therefore appears that the increased rates will not prove adequate unless the gross rate should bring in more levenue than is anticipated, or a considerable reduction in expense occurs.

I SEAL I APPLICATION NO. 4558 In the Matter of the Application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Com - pany for Authority to increase its exchange rates at Loup City, Nebraska. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The applicant asks for the following increased rates applying to business service only: </seg>
            <seg id="p359">432 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Monthly rate Monthly rate Without Sur- With Sur- charge charge Business individual - $3.50 $3.85 Business party 3.00 3.30 In justification of its request for this increase, the company refers to the present reconstruction program which it has carried out at Loup City. This program has changed the plant from a magneto open-wire system to a common battery system with cable replacing the open wires. The plant has been brought up to date with the commendable intention Ot furnishing the best possible service at Loup City. The testimony at a hearing held at Loup City on May 28, 1921, indicated that the cost of the plant was increased because of this transition from approximately $28,000.00 to $58,219.02. Although no increases of residence rates are prayed for, it is anti- cipated that some additional revenue will result from the discontinuance of four-party residence service, as the present four-party subscribers will of necessity pay the higher two or one party rate. While the company bases its request for this rate increase on the extensive program which has been carried out, it is not the intention Of the company to defray the expense of this program from revenues resulting from the increased rates. This statement seems almost super- fluor~, considering the principles of rate making which determine the action of the Nebraska State Railway Commission in all cases, but as there seems to have been some misunderstanding concerning the matter it is made in the interest of clarity. The applicant asks simply that llicse rates be adequate to pay all expenses and a reasonable return on the fair value of the plant as it now stands after reconstruction. This request is in entire accordance with the theory of rate-making pursued by the Commission. From a careful study of the evidence submitted at the hearing, the following statement of revenues and expenses for the first four months of 1921, has been compiled: Revenues $5,372.21 Expenses Operating expenses $4,884.06 Taxes 225.78 â 5,109.84 Net income available for interest, dividends, etc $ 262.37 Had the rates applied for been in effect during this four month period, an increase of revenue in the amount of $372.00 would have been real- ized. This would have brought the net increase available for interest and dividends to $634.37, which represents a return of 3.27'% on the .book cost of $58,219.00. It, therefore, appears that the rates asked for we not unreasonable. </seg>
            <seg id="p360">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 433 Some objections have been registered by patrons of Loup City against the proposed increase. These objections are based, to a large extent, upon a misunderstanding involving an agreement concerning the rates which were to be charged after reconstruction by the applicant company. The Commission prefers to avoid consideration of the causes underlying this misunderstanding, as this is a matter entirely 'beyond its jurisdiction, and therefore having no bearing upon the case. To base an adjustment of rates on such matters to the exclusion of the financial needs of the applicant, would avail nothing except to invite the censure of the courts. However, the objection that the decline of prices of labor and material may render an advance in the rate schedule unreasonable in the future, is entirely valid and is given full consideration toy the Commission in the settlement of this case. Therefore, although it 1s not anticipated that such reduction of costs will be extensive enough to enable the company to again lower its rates, this authority will be gTanted for a temporary period only, in order that the interests of the patrons may be guarded should such coat reductions be realized.

In the Matter of the Application of All Nebraska Carriers for Authority to Amend Existing Diversion and Reconsignment Rules. OPINION AND FINDING. BROWNE, Commissioner: Application has been filed by Nebraska railroad carriers through F. Montmorency, chairman of the carriers committee with authority to make the application, asking certain amendments to existing diversion and reconsignment rules effective on Nebraska intrastate traffic, such amendments having already been authorized on interstate traffic through action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in special permission No. 52373. The proposed changes are as follows: SURRENDER BILLS OF LADING Change present "Condition C" to read: "On straight consignments the original bill of lading should be surrendered or other proof of ownership established. On shipments </seg>
            <seg id="p364">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 437 DI\ consigned to order' original bill of lading should be surrendered for endorsement or exchange, or in its absence satisfactory bond of in - demnity executed in lieu thereof, or other approved security given at the time the diversion or reconsignment order is placed." "EMPARGO RULH OR DIVERSION TO EMBARGO POINTS Substitute following for present rule: "Orders for diversion or reconsignment will not be accepted under these rules at or to a station or to a point of delivery against which an embargo is in force. Shipments made under authorized permits are not subject to this condition." ERSION OR RECONSIGNMENT TO POINTS WITHIN SWITCHING LIMITS BEFORE PLACEMENT. Add under "Application" the following: "The term 'switching limits' as used in these rules means all locations within the recognized switching limits of all carriers serving the billed destination, and not merely the switching limits of the carriers receiving the road haul movement." Cancel present Rule 8, and substitute the following: "RULE 8. STOPPING IN TRANSITâ NOTIFYING CON - SIGNEE OF CARS HELD AT HOLDING POINT. (a) "If a car is stopped for orders for the purpose of delivery or diversion or reconsignment or reforwarding prior to the arrival at original billed destination, or if such destination is served by a terminal yard, then prior to arrival at such terminal yard, on request of consignor, consignee, or owner, the following charges will be made for the service: (in Western territory $2.50 per car; in Illinois territory, $3.00 per car) and the point where the car is stopped will be considered the destination of the freight. If the car is subsequently forwarded from point at which held, the provisions of Rules 9, 10, 11 or 12, as the case may be, will also be applied. The service of stopping as provided in this rule will not prevent one change of destination under the provisions of Rule 5. (b) "If after arrival at destination, or If such destination Is served by a terminal yard, then after arrival at such terminal yard, a car is withheld from placement, on request of consignor, consignee or owner, no charge will be made for such service but the point at which held will be considered the destination of the freight and the party upon whose order car is held will be notified at the post offlice address designated by him. If the car is subsequently placed for unloading or is reforwarded from the point at which held, the provisions of Rules 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, as the case may be, will also be applied The service of withholding from placement as provided in this rule will not prevent a change of destination under the provision of Rule 5 nor prevent a diversion or reoon - signment under the provision of Rule 11." </seg>
            <seg id="p365">438 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT NOTE: In order that carriers may correctly identify the rules named in Rule 8-B next above the following explanation is furnished as carriers having rules differently num - bered will need to change their references accordingly: RULE 9. CHANGE AT DESTINATION ON ORDERS GIVEN BEFORE ARRIVAL. RULE 10. DIVERSION OR RECONSIGNMBNT TO POINTS OUTSIDE SWITCHING LIMITS BEFORE PLACEMENT. RULE 11. DIVERSION OR RECONSIGNMENT TO POINTS WITHIN SWITCHING LIMITS BEFORE PLACEMENT. RULE 12. DIVERSION OR RECONSIGNMENT TO POINTS OUTSIDE SWITCHING LIMITS AFTER PLACEMENT. RULE 13. DIVERSION OR RECONSIGNMENT TO POINTS WITHIN SWITCHING LIMITS AFTER PLACEMENT. Add amendment to Rule No. 12 "If a car has been placed for unloading on a public delivery track, but has not been unloaded or accepted by consignee or owner, it will be subject to Rule 10." t Careful check of the proposed changes indicates that they can be thorized without hearing inasmuch as the interests of shippers are not adversely affected. It is the desire of the carriers to publish these rules effective intrastate on June 1, 1921, publication to be madÂ» at the same time the interstate publication is made. In our opinion this constitutes a sufficient emergency to authorize the waiving of the statutory period and the amendments will be authorized, effective June 1, 1921.

In the Matter of the Application of the American Railway Express Com - pany for Approval of Changes in Official Express Classification No. 27. APPEARANCES: Clias. E.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The American Railway Express company filed an application for authority to make official Express Classification No. 27 effective on fatrastate traffic in this state. The express company, in filing this appli - cation, called attention to the fact that Official Classification No. 27 had become effective on interstate traffic throughout the United States, on January 10, 1921, and that the changes in rules and ratings so made effective were approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket Mo. 11416. 59 ICC, page 285. At all stages of the proceedings, the respondents have urged the desirability of making a uniform classification to govern both state and interstate commerce. This fact may be admitted without in any respect relieving this commission of its duty to investigate changes in rates and classifications proposed by Nebraska carriers, and to determine whether or not the proposed changes may lawfully become effective. We cannot abdicate the duties imposed upon us by the laws of this state and make our judgment conform to that of the Interstate Commerce Commission, regardless of the evidence before us. After due notice, a hearing regarding this matter was held at </seg>
            <seg id="p367">440 Lincoln, June 1, 1921. Briefs were filed by various parties of record, and all the facts so developed have had careful consideration. No opposition was offered by shippers with respect to a considerable proportion of the proposed changes. We will not discuss the propriety of such changes, but will permit them to become effective, without prejudice to any cause of action which may hereafter arise with refer - ence thereto. Our report deals only with contested items. RULE 26, This rule contains the following provisions "Containers which are customarily used several ' times for transportation of goods by express, such as bread boxes or dog kennels, which cannot be satisfactorily marked with brush, stencil, water-proof crayon or label, may be accepted when bearing two addressed tags securely attached to the package." tSome objection to this provision was made by fruit shippers contended that nothing was gained, and considerable extra work occasioned by requiring the double tagging of such packages as ina crates. Our investigation shows that this provision of rule 26 is now effective in the last paragraph of Sub-section B of rule 30, Official Express Classification No. 26. We are, therefore, unable to deal with the reasonableness of the requirements contained in this rule, Since it is not an issue in the pending proceedings. RULE 27 In connection with this rule, the express company proposes to make the following provisions effective: BANANAS. "When temperature is 20 degrees or more below zero, each bunch must be enclosed in not less than three paper bags, full length of each bunch, tied at the top around the stem. When tempera - ture is between zero and 20 degrees below zero, each bunch must be enclosed in not less than two paper bags, the full length of each bunch. and tied at the top around the stem." * â¢ â¢ kALL OTHER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. "When the tempera - re is zero or below, perishable shipments described above must be livered by the shipper to the express company at its depot office." As to banana shipments â the record does not afford any substantial proof of the superiority of paper bags over other methods of protecting shipments if bananas in zero weather. Shippers contend that they are providing better protection for banana shipments by means of </seg>
            <seg id="p368">441 wrapping the bunches in several layers of heavy brown paper, at less expense than would be incurred by the adoption of the methods prescribed in the rule stated above. Considerable testimony was ad - duced to show that adequate protection is afforded by present methods of packing, and that the proposed rule would result in additional labor and expense â which would not clearly serve a useful purpose. The record does not clearly establish the fact that the use of paper bags of the number and in the manner prescribed by the express company would result in better protection to banana shipments in transit. It does not appear of record in this case, for example, that interstate shipments moving since January 10, 1921, under weather conditions covered by the rule were attended with a lower proportion of losses in transit, than state shipments on which the rule had not yet become effective. Shippers suggest that this rule should be amended by inserting after the word "bags," wherever it occurs in the proposed rule, the following phrase, "or its equivalent or better." Based on thÂ» facts of record in this case, we are of the opinion that the rule should be modified along these lines. The proposed modification will provide greater flexibility with respect to protection of banana shipments In zero weather, and the agent of the express company will be in a posi - tion to refuse to accept shipments which are not prop?rly protected, and therefore, no injury could result to the express company by reason of this slight change in the form of the rule. ELIMINATION OF PICK-UP SERVICE ON OTHER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. â The express company contended that shippers are better equipped to protect shipments of fruits and vegetables in the course of movement from shipper's wi rehcuse to the depot office of the express company than is the company Itself. The respondent contends that in view of the fact that shippers are already prepared to safely handle shipments in zero weather and ma';e dsliv^ry in rood condition to the express company, that the company s'loull not be required to provide itself with equipment to properly sffegvard shipments under such weather conditions. The ground talen by the exp-e ;s company would be more tenable if it were just euba -kin â ? upon tie business of furnishing express service under wea.her conditions net in the northern latitudes, but since, as a matter of fact, it has been engaged in the handling of these perishable shipments over a long period of years in zero weather, it may be presumed to have all the equipment reasonably necessary to protect such shipments, incident to the render - ing of pick-up service, and it may also be presumed to have adequate experience with' reference to the necessary protection to be afforded in that connection. It will be observed, in connection with this rule, that the express </seg>
            <seg id="p369">442 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT company does not attempt to restrict its obligation to safely render delivery service on the perishable shipments which it is now asking rppers to deliver at its depot office, thereby divesting the company the obligation to furnish pick-up service. It is obvious that the express company must meet the same problem in connection with til** delivery of such shipments when the temperature is zero or below, as it would meet in rendering pick-up service on similar shipments. It will also be observed that the express company does not limit its obligation to perform pick-up service in the case of other perishable commodities which may be offered for shipment under weather condi - tions the same as those under which it refuses to perform the pick-up service in connection with fruits and vegetables. It seems clear that the proposed rule would result in unjust discrimination against the Epper of other fruits and vegetables, since the value of the servie" him is substantially reduced, while the company continues to perform full service for shippers of other perishable commodities, under lilar circumstances and conditions. Lit also seems clear that there would be great difficulty in handling ms in connection with shipments made during zero weather. Under Official Classification No. 27 rules, the shipper would be required to make delivery at the depot office at the express company in zero weather, and the express company would receive the shipment in apparent good order, but would be in position to argue, when claim was presented, that while the shipment was in apparent good order. as a matter of fact it was damaged by weather when received. As a matter of tariff provisions, the express company would clearly be liabl&lt; - for damage incurred during the movement of perishable shipments from the depot at point of origin to the depot at destination, and also on its wagons at destination, from the depot to the consignee's place of business. If the shipper is made responsible for safe delivery from his warehouse to the depot at point of origin, it will always be very difficult to determine whether or not the damage occurred while in the shipper's hands, or while subsequently in the hands of the express company in transit, on the train, in the station at either point of origin or destination, or on the wagon of the express company in making delivery. Such a divided responsibility will most certainly result in greater difficulty in the settlement of claims on perishable shipments, and it will be observed that at least nominally, the express company would assume the full liability in connection with the delivery of a shipment, as to which it refused to assume any liability in con - nection with the pick-up service of the same shipment. Lin view of the foregoing facts, it is our view that this provision rule 27 should not become effective on intrastate traffic in this e </seg>
            <seg id="p370">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 443 EMPTY CARRIERS RETURNED. The express company proposes the elimination of the so-called aggregating rule, by means of which shipments of empty carriers returned might be consolidated and handled on the .basis of charges for the aggregate weight, instead of the separate charge for each package which would otherwise apply. To illustrate the situation resulting from this rule, it appears from exhibits filed in in this case that on six hypothetical movements of empty banana carriers, the aggregated charge per carrier would amount to 6.3 cents, as compared with a charge of 11 cents per crate, applying regardless of distance handled. No increase in the specific charge of 11 cents is proposed. The express company points out that the empty carrier occupies as much car space as the package constituting tha original shipment, and contends that the charges for the return of empty carriers generally are very low, and that although rates on express matter generally have been increased, rates on empty carriers have not been correspondingly increas-d. In view of the fact that empty earriera have at all times been handled by the express company at very substantial concessions, under the regular rates, and that the express company proposes to continue rates which arp low as com - pared with rates applicable on its traffic generally, ve are of the opinion that the proposed elimination of the aggregating ru'.e and the slight increase in charges on certain empty carriers hanra been justified. GREEN FRUIT. In connection with item 3J, page 3j of classifi - cation 27, the express company proposes to require fruic shipments, consisting of ten or more packages, tach weighing ten pounds tr less, to be crated or securely fastened together in bundles of not lesj than, four or more than ten. The testimony indicites that there have been occasional delays to passenger trains arising on account of the time required to handle a large number of small individual fruit packages, such as grape baskets. The point ij al:;o made that owing to the hurried process of unloading a large number of : mall packages, there is an increased probability of damage to shipments in transit. The probability of better handling of fewer packages, which would result from this rule, and the reduction of delays to fist pas;eiger trains would seem to amply justify the change. If, on the oth T hand, the actual application of the rule bears out shipper's contentions: that loss and damage claims would be increased, the facts should be promptly brought to the attention of the express company and this Commission, for such revision of the rule as may appear to be proper in the light of experience. XEWSPAPRPS. Tn itPm 36-2 of page 41 of Classification No. 27. the company proposes to increase the charge on daily newspapers from </seg>
            <seg id="p371">444 one-half to 1 cent per pound, where the merchandise rate is $4.50 per cwt. or less. The express company shows that the rates applying on daily newspapers were made to meet the competition of postal service, and that there have been two increases in postal rates without any corresponding increases in express rates. The company also states that in a conference preceding the hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission with reference to Classification No. 27. news - paper publishers agreed to the increase here in question. Respondent states specifically that a large Nebraska newspaper was directly repre - sented in the conferences of newspaper publisher's associations with the express company, which resulted in agreement as to the increases in express rates. In view of the foregoing facts, the increases in this item are approved. MAGAZINES AND PERIODICALS. In item 36-3, page 41 of the classification, the company proposes to increase rates on magazines and periodicals from 1 cent to 1 1-2 cents per pound. In support of this increase, the company shows that postal rates were increased on July 1, 1918, and again on July 1, 1919, and that the postal charges on this traffic range from 1 1-2 cents to 7 3-4 cents per pound. It appears that the present rate of 1 cent per pound was established to meet postal competition, and that the express company has not in - creased this rate when general increases in express rates were recently made. The rates on magazines and periodicals represent a substantial concession to the shippers of these commodities, as compared with the Standard charges applicable on merchandise shipments, and there does not appear to be any good reason why the traffic in question should not now be increased to a basis more consistent with that of the competing postal service, with reference to which thp rates \vfrÂ»&lt; originally established. The proposed increases are, therefore, approved. NEWSPAPERS OTHER THAN DAILYâ Some testimony was in - troduced in connection with the hearing of this case, which was appar - ently offered on the theory that some c'iange was proposed with refer - ence to charges on patent insides and magazine supplements to wesklv newspapers. Our examination of this question indicates that the ex - press company has merely clarified the description of commodities cov - ered by this heading, and that no increase in charges is proposed. LAUNDRY â In item 15, page 37 of Classification 27, the express company proposes to require that baskets or hampers containing laundry shipments must be locked or sealed by shipper before they will be re - ceived for transportation . Common experience indicates that there is often som? ground for dispute between the laundry and its customers as </seg>
            <seg id="p372">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 445 to the number and kind of articles entrusted to the laundry, and in view of this fact it seems proper that shipper should be required to seal or se - curely fasten packages which they are returning to customers, and thereby assist in definitely placing the responsibility for differences be - tween the count of the laundry and the customer, which might otherwise become the basis of a claim against the express company. In view of the facts of record in connection â with this matter, fe are of the opinion that the proposed rule is reasonable, and it is hereby - approved. ICE CREAM â In item 1, page 37 of the classification, the express company proposes an increase in the estimated weight applying on five-gallon shipments of ice cream. The testimony submitted by the ex - press company dealt with this subject in very general terms, contend - ing that ice cream did not pay charges on the same proportion of gross weight as did many ether food products which also moved under icing. The company also urged that ice cream shipments often leaked brine in transit and caused damage to other shipments carried in the same car. No definite proof as to the number of claims resulting from leakage of brine was submitted by the company, and while it is clear that a leak - age of brine would probably result in damage to shipments with which it came in contact, the record does not show whether such damages are really substantial in character. A very considerable amount of testimony was introduced by ship - pers with reference to the ice cream traffic and all of its incidents. A number of exhibits were introduced to show that ice cream paid as high or higher revenue per cubic foot of space occupied, as did other perish - able commodities, whether moving under icing or not. The exhibits also showed that the revenue paying weight of ice cream in proportion to car space occupied was as great or greater than that of other perish - able commodities, some of which moved under icing and some of which did not. On the question of leakage of brine in transit and damage to other shipments, one witness testified that his company had made claims against the express company on but 20 tubs, out cf a total of 14.000 shipped in a two year period. Shippers state positively that where &amp; considerab'e leakage of brine occurs, ice cream would arrive at destina - tion oiu of condition, ;md claims would probably be filed tc cover such shipments. In view ct O-e test'mony beL'ore us in this record, it does not appear that the increased estimated weight applicable on ice cream shipments has been justified, and we are, therefore, of the opinion that the basis of weights now in effect should be continued.

In view of the character of the service rendered and the facts now before us. we are of the opinion that the proposed increases in charges for this service have been justified. TREES AND SHRUBS â In item 20, page 45 of the classification. the express company proposes to increase the charges on nursery stock from second class to the merchandise basis. The second class rating generally covers articles of food and drink and the rating when estab - lished was not intended to cover such articles as trees and shrubs, which were placed in that group. It appears that trees and shrubs are light and bulky articles, as compared with other shipments which are now classified on a merchandise basis. It, therefore, seems clear that the proposed change in rating has been justified, and it is hereby approved. ORDER We find from the evidence before us and the facts slated in the fore - going opinion, which is referred to and made a part hereof, that the changes from Express Classification No. 26, proposed in Express Classi - fication No. 27, have been justified with the exception of those items and the modification in others which are fully set forth in the opinion ot tht- Commission. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the American Railway Express company be and hereby is authorized to cancel its Express Classifica - tion No. 26, as applying to intrastate shipments within the state of Nebraska and to substitute therefor its Express Classification No. 27, after providing for the elimination of proposed changes in classification governing certain commodities, and the modification of other proposed classification changes as fully set forth in our opinion herein. This order will become effective not less than ten days after the date hereof on the filing with this Commission of tariffs in conformity with this order.

OPINION AND F'NDING COOK, Commissioner The Union Pacific Railroad company on June 1. 1921, made applica - tion to the Nebraska State Railway Commission for the approval of cer - tain station locations. No. 1 and 2, on its North Platte extension in Scotts Bluff county, Nebraska. The petitioner states that said extension within the state cf Nebraska is 14.06 miles long, on which it has made two station locations. The locations of said stations No. 1 and 2 were made by it after a most careful investigation by its chief engineer and officers of the company, which investigation included the consideration the transportation needs of the community to be served by said ex- tensions, the existence of main highways leading to and from said loca - tions, the ability from an operating standpoint to serve them with the greatest efficiency, as well as the topography and character of the ground upon which to locate suitable tcwn sites, and the availability of good water and draiaage for the use of its inhabitants. In pursuance to that request the Commission gave due notice to pll interested parties that it would hold a public hearing with respect to the location of said stations in the city of Gering on Friday, the tenth day of June. 1921. Upon that day the Commission went over the ground and made a personal inspection of the proposed station sites and the entire line between its present terminus 2.2 miles west of Haig and the state line between Nebraska and Wyoming. Thereafter, upon the said tenth day of June, a nnbiic bearing v-as had in th? city r 1 ' Gering, at which wa? present a lar r e nur^'er of citizens interested in the location of these stations. Opportunity was given to all persons present to offer testi - mony, to expreaa their views, and to ask questions of the witnesses. The railroad company examined as witnesses C. J. Lane, its general freight agent, R. L.. Huntley, its chief engineer, and W. M. Jeffers, its general manager. These witnesses testified in substance that they hid been appointed by the president of the company to go over the grour'l in </seg>
            <seg id="p375">448 EJOn and select the necessary stations for the proposed extension of North Platte branch, placing them in locations which would serve the lie interests, having due regard to the topography of the ground, the ition of the main traveled highways, drainage possibilities, territory to be served and operating conditions. They testified that they Went upon the ground in person, made a careful inspection of the entire sit - uation, in accordance with their instructions, talked the matter over thoroughly among themselves, and as a result have fixed upon locations No. 1 and 2 as the best which could be made. Location No. 1 is situated on the south side of the track in the southwest quarter of section twenty - five, township twenty-three, north, range fifty-seven, west. Locaton No. 2 is situated on the south side of the track in the southwest quarter of section thirty-four, in township twenty-three, north, range fifty-eight. west. Testimony to the contrary was presented by other parties, it being maintained by some of the witnesses that stations should be established immediately south of the bridge leading across the North Platte river from the towns of Mitchell and Morrill, which are located en the north side of the river on the Burlington railroad. It was claimed by other witnesses that station No. 2 should be located about a mile east Of the site selected. Testimony was also presented as to arrangements which had been made some ten years ago for the establishment of a station, about three and one-half miles west of Haig. The main line of the proposed extension is 2S.94 miles Ion tds from a point 2.2 miles west of Haig in Scotts Bluff county Xe - ska, in a westerly direction across the state line between Nebraska and Wyoming to a point 14.88 miles west of the state line of Nebraska, â "rom the terminus of the main line extension, a branch extends in a orthwesterly direction up Cherry creek valley, the length of the branch eing 13.2 miles. The total length of the extension, including the main ine and the Cherry creek branch, is 42.14 miles. Upon this extension ix station sites have been located, the average distance between sta - ons being seven miles. The distance between Haig, the last station pen the completed railroad, and station No. 1 in Nebraska is 7.66 miles, nd between stations No. 1 and No. 2, near the state line in NVbraska, S 7.90 miles. The testimony of the railroad officials was to the effect that it was the intention of the company to establish side tracks and beet dump facilities between stations No. 1 and 2, and that it also proposed to locate similar facilities at the most convenient points in the vicinity cf the bridges opposite Mitchell and Morrill. It is the opinion of the Commission that the railroad company h;is used its best efforts to select suitable locations for these Stations and has exercised gcod judgment in selections made. They have been prop - erly spaced and due attention has been given to the matter of important </seg>
            <seg id="p376">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 449 highways which will serve them, also to the question of drainage and other circumstances proper to be taken into consideration in the estab - lishment of station facilities. It is not the disposition of the Commission to interfere with the location of station sites made under these circum - stances. It will not interfere with the discretion exercised by the rail - road, unless the interests of the public have not been properly consid - ered, or that selfish interests have prevailed in the selection of the sites. The Commission is impressed with the view that the locations recom - mended are suitable for the purposes intended. The railroad company has announced its determination to accept no gratuities for this extension in the way cf depot grounds, or otherwise, but asks that the location of its stations in Nebraska be approved, subject to the condition that a contract, or contracts, be entered into with some reliable parties for the establishment of a town site at each of the stations No. 1 and 2, upon the following terms and conditions, the observance of which is to be se - cured by bond satisfactory to the railroad company, and which conditions are, as far as practicable, to run with the land: "1. To duly survey and plat, according to law, a town site upon the lands lying; contiguous to said station and upon the side of the railroad on which said station is located, duly dedicating to the public all lands required for streets, alleys, parks and public grounds. "2. To acquire title to, or control of, an area of land at least three hundred (300) feet wide and running the full length of said wn site, on the oposite side from the station, and immediately ad- joining the right of way, and to covenant with said railroad company that the land so acquired or controlled shall be used for industrial purposes only, save and except with the special permission of said railroad company. "3. To donate proper sites for all public schools and churchPB upon due application therefor at any time within five (5) years after the location and establishment of said station. "4. To establish business and residence sections in said town site, with reasonable building requirements for protection from fire in the business section. "5. To make, within one year from and after the location and establishment of said station, suitable public improvements â such as the grading and surfacing of streets, the building of sidewalks, and the construction of a water system â to bring about the early develop - ment of said town site. "6. The foregoing conditions to inure to the benefit of, and to be binding upon, the contracting parties, their heirs, executors, ad - ministrators, successors and assigns, and, in so far as practicable, to run with the land." The conditions seem to be reasonable and fair and the locations of the stations N'o. 1 and 2, and the accompanying town sites, will be ap - proved, subject to said conditions. In the event that the railroad com - pany is unable to make a contract for the establishment of a town si's at any of said stations upon the conditions named, the matter will be given further consideration by the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p377">450 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Commission is very doubtful whether the present plat of the business section of the town at station No. 2, with relation to the proposed location Of the depot and future industries on the railroad right of way, is a proper one. It suggests a location for the business section of the town more closely in touch with station facilities. It must be evident to all that when a town develops subsequently to the location of a station. t cannot be heard to complain that the depot is not properly located with ierenee to the town. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the application of the Union Pacific Railroad company for the approval of the location of two stations, No. 1 and 2, upon the North Biatte extension of the railroad of said company in Scotts Bluff county, Nebraska be, and the same is, hereby approved. The Commission having given due notice to all parties concerned, held a public hearing with re - spect to the propriety of the locations tentatively made by said railroad company, have gone over the ground and have personally examined the said depot sites and the locations of the accompanying town sites and the surrounding territory, and having heard the evidence with respect thereto the Said depot and town site locations and each of them ar approved. The depot sites so approved are described as follow Station No. 1 is located on the south side of the track in the southwest quarter of Section twenty-five &lt;25&gt;. Township twenty-three (23), North, Range fifty-seven (57), west, and includes such station facilities as are now considered necessary, located in the south halt (S. %) of Section twenty-five (26), Township twenty-three (23), North, Range fifty-seven (57), west. Station No. 2 is located on the south side of the track in tha southwest quarter of Section thirty-four (34), Township twentvthret' (23), North, Range fifty-eight (58), west, and includes such station facilities as are now considered necessary, located in the south halt (S. %) of section thirty-four (34), Township twenty-three (23), North, Range fifty-eight (58), west. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the foregoing approval is upon con - dition, however, that the railroad company is able to make a contract, or contracts, With some reliable party, or parties, lor the establishment of a town site at each of the said stations No. 1 and 2, obligating said party, Or parties, as per conditions prescribed in contract set forth in the body of this opinion.

            <seg id="p378">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 451 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for Authority to make certain changes in its rate schedule at Bruning. Appearances : For Applicantâ R. E. Mattison, general manager; W. L. Lemon, general auditor; Thos. C. Woods, attorney; W. H. Caman, district commercial superintendent. OPINION AND FINDING COOK, Commissioner The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company operates an exchange at Bruning, Nebraska, as a part of its Nebraska properties. It has at Bruning at this time a total of 269 subscribers â business, residence and farm. The major portion are served by a metallic circuit. The Lincoln company acquired this property through the purchase of an existing independent company, which had operated a plant at Bruning and surrounding territory for a number of years. The inde - pendent company had, like many other telephone companies, failed to build up a depreciation fund to take care of the rebuilding of its plant when it became obsolete. The plant was at the time of purchase in a run-down condition, not giving the subscribers at all times satisfactory service. The Lincoln company, after acquiring the plant, put on an extensive- campaign of improvements and betterments, bringing the serv- ice and the capacity of the plant up to the requirements of the com - munity. In this connection, the books of the company show that old property having an original value of 81,084.46 was replaced by new ma - terials representing a value of $1,703.04 during the period from the time when the plant was purchased to July 31, 1921. This transaction re - sulted in an increase of the net value of the plant in the amount of SI. 721. 09, which is a monetary measure of the improvement in service that the subscribers are now enjoying. No portion of this amount has been charged against the revenues at this exchange, but the total has been advanced from the general funds of the Lincoln company. This represents the proper and usual procedure, and reference Is made to the matter only because a misconception often prevails regarding the method of handling rebuilding programs on the books of the Lincoln company. It developed at a hearing held by the Commission at Bruning on September 22, 1921, that the service now being maintained by the Lin - coln company at Bruning is good and the company is amply provided with facilities to extend service to all parties in the community desir- APPLICATION NO. 4582 </seg>

The Lincoln company, after an experimental period with the rates as handed down to it by the independent company, viz., one-party line business, $2.00 per month, one-party line residence, $1.00 per month, and farm, $1.25 per month, found that they did not produce revenue suf - ficient to provide the service demanded at this point. The Lincoln com - pany prepared from its books and accounts an exhibit, which was ex - plained, under oath, by the general manager of the company, Mr. Matti - son, making it a part of the record in this investigation, with the fol - lowing discoveries, based on one year's operation â August 1, 1920, to July 31, 1921. Under this showing the total revenue for the year was $4,561.70 and the total expense of operation during the same year was $6,272.69, leaving the earnings short $1,710.99, without providing interest on investment, which interest is the real stimulant for the operation of the company's plant. The question was asked by a subscriber if it were fair to take the year in Question as a basis for an average year expense, as it covered the period of reconstruction of the plant by the Lincoln company. This was answered by a witness for the company by explaining that the extensions and rebuilding part of an expense ol this nature was necessarily capitalized and paid for from moneys re - ceived from that source, and not paid for from the rentals of that period, and that the forecast as set up would be a fair sample of the expenses and receipts over a period of years. The Lincoln company made ap - plication to this Commission asking for privilege to publish and collect at this station rates that would more nearly produce revenue sufficient to maintain good service and pay interest on the investment, as fol - lows: One-party line business, $2.75 per month; one-party line residence. $1.50 per month; farm, $1.50 per month. These rates, applied to the exchange with the present number of subscribers, would produce addi - tional revenue of $1,179.00 per year, which would still leave the earnings short 1531.99, not providing for interest on the investment. The ques - tion was asked of the witness for the company why they did not ask for a rate that would provide revenue sufficient and was answered by the general manager of the company by saying that the rates asked for in this application were the same as rates used at plants of corre sponding size in the surrounding territory and villages and that they did not seek to discriminate against the subscribers of this exchange by asking for larger rates. Witness also testified that it was his opinion that material and labor would be somewhat reduced in the near futura and by this and other economies, which they hoped to install, they migM be able to furnish satisfactory service at Bruning with schedule asked for. The figures and statements, as testified to by the witness for the Lincoln company in this history, are entirely in accord with the figurPS and monthly reports furnished the accounting department of this Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p380">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 453 mission. Furthermore, a careful examination of the exhibits by the ac- counting department of the Commission indicates that they are mathe- matically correct, and that the portions of general expense of the Lin- coln company allocated to this exchange have been properly computed. In making this examination a comparison of operating expenses at this point with the general operating expenses of the entire Lincoln system for the same period was made, disclosing the following important fact: Lincoln Bruninp System Exchange Total average monthly operating expense per station $2,404 $1,861 It follows that the exhibits submitted have not been unduly padded. and that the expenses at the Bruning exchange are conservative â when compared with the system expenses. We are quite inclined to credit the Lincoln company with a genuine willingness to assume its full share of the loss at this point against the time when the rates can be ad- justed without affecting the subscribers, as it would at the present time. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com- mission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company be and it hereby is authorized to publish and collect the following schedule of rates to apply at their station at Bruning, Nebraska: Net Gross Business, one-party : $2.75 $3.00 Business extension 1.00 1.25 Residence, one-party 1.50 1.75 Farm, metallic 1.50 1.75 The business and residence rate to be effective on and after Decem ber 1, 1921; the farm rate to be effective on and after January 1, 1922.

(SEAL) BROWNE, Concurring: There is no other conclusion to be reached than that set forth in the main opinion herein. All regulating bodies are reluctant to authorize a rate increase in this period of general depression. No process of rea - soning, however, will permit the conclusion that the people at this ex - change are any harder pressed financially than at other localities in the state. This applicant company has sixty exchanges in Nebraska where the rates are practically identical in level with those asked for at this exchange. These rates have been paid through such part of the period of depression as has already passed. The subscribers at this ex - change are. therefore, financially ahead of the subscribers at other like exchanges because they have thus far paid a very low rate. I am constrained, however, to voice my objection to some of tho conclusions as set forth in the finding based on the evidence. If it is true that this exchange, under the level of rates asked for, will lack $1,370.02 of paying operating expenses and taxes, without a return, then this applicant, it seems to me, has exercised poor business judgment in acquiring the exchange, as it must preforce be a burden upon the rest of the system. If it is true, also, that at this exchange, under the level of rates asked for and approved in the main opinion, the applicant will operate at such a very decisive deficit it must generally be true of sixty other exchanges of this company where the rates are approximately the same as asked for here and where the expenses ought to differ very little from those at this exchange. If, then, the company is operating one-half of its total number of exchanges at heavy losses, it must, In order to earn the 5 per cent on its outstanding obligations which it is earning, be charging the larger exchanges enough to make up the deficit at the smaller exchanges and this is probably unfair to the larger ex - changes. The company has not set forth in the trial of this case any fictitious expenses. That is not alleged. The expenses set forth by it are those taken from its accounts as spread among all the exchanges which. It operates. My objection goes to the methods of allocating general ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p385">458 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL, REPORT penses. This company spreads its costs on a per station basis over the entire system for such large expenditures as traffic superintendence, com - mercial general administration, commercial district administration, sal - aries of general officers, salaries and maintennace of its engineering staff, expenses of the general offices, arid uncollectible revenue. The company does not charge against all its exchanges more money than it costs for these items, but to my mind unquestionably in its method of allocation it requires the small exchanges to bear a burden for cer - tain items of expense which they do not cause, in the ratio of the num - ber of stations served. Hence, I do not reconcile in my mind the conclusions that all these exchanges are operating at very decided losses with the actual facts and with the determination of the applicant company not only to retain these sixty small exchanges but from time to time to add others. I do not overlook the fact that even if the basis of criticism here voiced did not exist the company would earn much less than a fair re - turn from the rates approved. If the criticism is unfounded then there is small hope of these exchanges being put on a paying basis. This statement is made especially regarding Application No. 4583, for the Deweese exchange, but it applies in varying degrees regarding the or - ders entered on Applications Nos. 4587, 4584, 8585 and 4582, concerning exchanges respectively at Jansen, Steele City and Endicott, Gilead and Bruning.

In this connection, the books of the company show that old property having a depreciated value of $424.65 was replaced by new materials rep - resenting a value of $3,070.45 during the period from the time when the plant was purchased to July 31, 1921. This transaction resulted in an expenditure of $2,645.80, which is a monetary measure of the improve - ment in service that the subscribers are now enjoying. No portion of this amount has been charged against the revenues at this exchange, but the total has been advanced from the general funds of the Lincoln company. This represents the proper and usual procedure, and reference is made to the matter only because a misconception often prevails regard - ing the method of handling rebuilding programs on the books of the Lincoln company. It developed at a hearing held by the Commission at Steele City on September 21, 1921, that the service now being maintained by the Lin - coln company at Steele City is good and the company is amply provided with facilities to extend service to all parties in the community desiring same; also, that its helpers at Steele City are efficient and willing to co-operate with the subscribers in an effort to maintain a first-class phone service at all times. The Lincoln company, after an experimental period with the rates as handed down to it by the independent company, viz., one-party line business, SI. 50 per month; one-party line residence, $1.25 per month, and farm, $1.25 per month, found that they did not provide revenue sufficient to maintain the service demanded at this point. The Lincoln company prepared from its books and accounts an exhibit, which was explained, under oath, by the general manager of the company, Mr. Mattison, mak - ing it a part of the record in this investigation, with the following dis - coveries, based on one year's operation â August 1, 1920, to July 31, 1921. Under this showing the total revenue for the year was $3,126.08 and the total expense of operation during the same year was 14,035.07, leaving the earnings short $908.99, without providing interest on investment, which interest is the real stimulant for the operation of the company's plant. The question was asked by a subscriber if it were fair to take the year in question as a basis for an average year expense as it covered the period of reconstruction of the plant by the Lincoln company. This was answered by a witness for the company by explaining that the exten - sions and rebuilding part of an expense of this nature was necessarily capitalized and paid for from moneys received from that source, and not </seg>

The question was asked of the witness for the com pany why they did not ask for a rate that would provide revenue suffi- cient and was answered by the general manager of the company by say- ing that the rates asked for in this application were the same as rates used at plants of corresponding size in the surrounding territory and villages and that it would be a discrimination against the subscribers of this exchange by asking for larger rates. Witness also testified that it was his opinion that material and labor would be somewhat reduced in the near future and by this and other economies, which they hoped to install, they might be able to furnish satisfactory service at Stee'.e City with schedule asked for.

OPION1ON AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The applicant, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, filed its petition with us on August 8, alleging that passenger trains Nos. 33 and 34, operating between Omaha and Goodland, Kansas, had been operating at a loss during the past year and a half, and that the traffic Served by these trains does not warrant their continued operation. The application further states that other trains performing local service afford reasonably adequate service for the traffic which is now handled on trains Nos. 27 and 28, operating between Omaha and Belleville, which were formerly known as Nos. 33 and 34. A hearing on this application was set down for August 23, and was continued until August 31, upon which date a large number of shippers and residents along the lines of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway appeared and fully submitted their objections to the discon - tinuance 01' these trains, together with suggestions for a substitute serv- in the event that the applications were granted. The testimony in this case is to the effect that trains Nos. 27 and 28, formerly known as 33 and 34, were put in operation originally to take care of the heavy local express traffic which was then being handled on trains 5 and 6. Statements made by protestants indicated that trains 27 and 28 have handled a very considerable volume of ice cream, fruit and other perishable express shipments, as well as considerable general merchandise to points south of Lincoln, and that a substantial volume of milk and cream is received at Lincolr on train 28, and the empty cans returned to the producing territory on train 27. To meet the Objections Of shippers of express, and particularly to take care of perishable shipments, the applicant agreed to arrange for the handling of express on train No. 5 to all scheduled state and interstate stops made by this train, and into other territories via junction points, at which it regularly stops, and that perishable express might also be handled on train No. 7 to scheduled state and interstate stops now made by this train, and into other territory via junction points, where it regularly Stops. TO meet the objections of passengers residing at Alvo and Murdock and vicinity, it was agreed that train No. 6 should make flag stops at these points, if the application herein were granted. The ap - plicant further agreed to handle passengers on trains 94 and 97 to and from South Bend and other points at which these trains stop. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 472 The applicant introduced testimony as to the earnings of this train arising from passenger service, as compared with the so-called "out of pocket" costs of operating the trains in question. While this branch oÂ£ the evidence is not entirely satisfactory, and some items of revenue which might properly have been included were not taken into consideration, and at the same time some items of expense were taken into account which might have been excluded in arriving at out of pocket costs, the figures produced seem to clearly indicate that the revenues derived from the operation of these trains do no cover the expenses which might properly be charged against them, and that they are being operated at a loss, with a constantly decreasing volume of passenger traffic, Which does not justify their continued operation. While it is true that the applicant herein is legally required to furnish a certain minimum of pas - senger service necessary to properly discharge its functions as a com - mon carrier, the testimony in this case does not make it clear that the discontinuance of these trains would result in leaving the territory now served by them, with less service than the applicant is required to furnish, regardless of the profit or loss arising from the operation of passenger service. It clearly appears that the substitute service offered, with respect to express shipments, would actually result in improved service in making deliveries to some territory now served by train 27, and that Other substitute express service would be at least as good as that now afforded by this train. In view of all the foregoing facts, it is the opinion of the Commission that the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Com - pany for permission to discontinue the operation of trains Nos. 27 and 2S, should be granted, upon the condition that the applicant, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, will make the arrangements for handling express on trains 5 and 7, and passengers on trains 6, 94 and 97, which were discussed at the hearing, and which are referred to above. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission, that the applicant, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company shall be, and hereby is authorized to discontinue the operation of trains Nos. 27 and 28, within the state of Nebraska, on and after October 9, 1921, upon the condition that the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company shall arrange for the substitute express and passenger service referred to in the findings Of the Commission herein.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER. TAYLOR. Chairman: Order in this matter was issued on September 19, 1921, approving the application of the company, except for the modification that the terminus of the Twenty-third street line should be made in the inter - section at Twenty-third and Holdrege instead of a block south of that point. Now comes John Dudek and others, residing in the vicinity of Holdrege street from Nineteenth to Twenty-third, and pray for a re - heiiring of the case. They base their prayer for rehearing very largely on the fact that the traction company originally asked authority to take up its tracks in order to avoid the expense of its portion of the cost of the pavement on Holdrege street, but that now said Traction com - pany has entered into an agreement to pay at least some portion of the .cost assessed against it, regardless of the fact that its rails are to be removed. Petitioners allege that since the company will be put to an expense for paving in any event, its chief reason for removal of the tracks is no longer of any effect. The other reasons assigned in the petition for rehearing are very largely a repetition of the allegations made by the petitioners at the time of the original hearing and involve the inconvenience to which patrons would be put by the removal of the track in question. Action upon the original application herein was purposely deferred by the Commission pending a hearing on the application of the Traction company for authority to remove its tracks and abandon its service on South Twelfth street, since the readjustments there proposed involved the establishment of a cross-town service through the connection of the South Fourteenth street and North Twenty-third street lines. The evi - dence showed that it would be impossible to operate a ten minute serv - ice over the proposed cross-town line, should the four blocks on Holdrege street not be eliminated. The Commission found the establishment ol the cross-town line to be an economic step in the plan for maintaining street railway transportation service in this city. As stated in the original order in this case, it is estimated that a saving of at least S15.000 per year would be accomplished by connecting the two lines referred to. The elimination of the four blocks on Holdrege street is an essential element in this readjustment. So important, in the opinion of the Commission, is the establishment of this cross-town service, that </seg>
            <seg id="p401">474 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT the abandonment of the four blocks on Holdrege street would be justi - fied for this reason alone, irrespective of the cost of paving. Through the co-operation of the city of Lincoln, the company, certain of the patrons affected, and this Commission, a general readjustment of the lines and service has been finally accomplished and approved. The re - sult promises to benefit the people of Lincoln as a whole. It would require new evidence of a very important character to warrant a re - hearing. Such evidence is not indicated by the petition. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the motion should be denied.

(SEAL) In the Matter of the Application of The Lincoln Traction Company for Authority to Discontinue Service and Remove Track from Nineteenth to Twenty-third Streets on Holdrege and one block south of Holdrege on Twenty-third Street. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This cause comes on for hearing on a motion for a new trial filed by John Dudek et al. To obtain an adequate understanding it will be necessary briefly to recite the proceedings that have already been had. The application in this case. Application 4603, was filed by The Lin - coln Traction Company on August 8, 1921, asking leave to discontinue service on a certain portion of its line on Twenty-third street and on a portion of its line on Holdrege Street in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska. The city had ordered Holdrege street to be paved and the application was made for leave to remove the tracks for the reason that the com - pany would be required to pave the space between its rails and one foot on either side of the track and that it was impossible for it to procure funds to pay the expense thereof. Thereafter there was filed with the city of Lincoln a petition ad- APPLICATION NO. 4603 </seg>
            <seg id="p402">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 475 dressed to the mayor and city commission, of Lincoln to prevent the Traction company from removing its tracks upon the streets in question. The time of filing of said petition does not appear, but it is dated August 10, 1921, and a copy was offered at the hearing before this Commission on August 30, 1921. Mr. Dudek and those appearing with him were signers of the petition, the body of which is as follows: "We, the undersigned, patrons of the Lincoln Traction Com - pany and living on the Holdrege Street car line, petition your Hon - orable Body to prevent the Lincoln Traction Company from removing their tracks from Nineteenth to Twenty-third streets, on Holdrege, as the removal of same would work a hardship on our families In getting to town." I On August 22, 1921, the Lincoln Traction Company filed an applica - tion. Application Xo. 460S, to re-route the cars on the Twenty-third street line and to abandon its service on Holdrege street in carrying out its new plan. The applications were heard on August 30, 1921. While no formal order of consolidation was entered, it was the intention, as the record shows, that the applications should be consolidated and they were so treated by all parties at the hearing; they were also so treated in the findings and orders of the Commission. Mr. Dudek and the other prop - erty owners, desiring that the pavement should be completed in ac - cordance with the original plan and opposing the application of the company for removal of the tracks, appeared by their attorney, Mr. Sterling F. Mutz, who participated in the hearing. Mr. TDudek appeared as a witness and testified that he circulated one of the petitions men - tioned above; he also described the disadvantages that would come from removal of the tracks. There was no suggestion at the time that the parties had not had ample notice of the pendency of the proceedings and of the time of hearing. The evidence shows that they were fully advised concerning them. On September 19, 1921, an order was entered, covering both applica - tions. It authorized the company to abandon the track on Holdrege street as prayed. On the 23rd of September, 1921, Mr. Dudek and his associates filed a petition before the Commission, alleging that inasmuch as the Com - pany had agreed to pay a certain portion of the cost of the pavement and the controversy between the city and the company had been settled the chief ground for the company's application to remove its tracks no longer existed. The petition alleged that the chief reason assigned by the Traction company in asking the privilege of abandoning the service was the cost of the paving that would be required from it. It reiterated the statements of the petitioners concerning the inconvenience and </seg>
            <seg id="p403">476 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL, REPORT damage that they would suffer by a removal of the tracks. As these matters were all fully covered in the original cases, heard together as above stated, the Commission concluded that re-litigation of the issues should not be had and on September 24, 1921, it entered a supplemental finding and order dismissing the petition. On September 27, 1921, Mr. Dudek and his associates filed a 'â¢motion for a new trial," the motion now before us, alleging the following grounds: Irregularity in the proceedings of the Commission by which they were prevented from having a fair trial; misconduct of the Lin - coln Traction Company; accident; surprise; lack of evidence to sustain the decision; illegality of the decision; newly discovered evidence; errors of law oeeuring at the trial and excepted to; the decision was rendered without the submission of any evidence; the case was set without notice to the petitioners," the Commission erred in deciding the case without giving petitioners an opportunity to be heard ; the Commission erred in not entering an order to require the company to continue service until the application could be heard and determined; the Commission arbi - trarily determined the cause without giving petitioners their day in court. There is no showing as to any misconduct of the prevailing party, accident or surprise. There is no showing concerning the newly dis - covered evidence alleged to exist. The action of the Commission in rul - ing on the petition of Mr. Dudek and his associates without a second hearing seems to be the ground of complaint. While the petition oi Mr. Dudek and others was filed subsequently to the hearing before the Commission and was given a different title, it was in substance identical with the contentions urged by them in the original proceeding. Re-litigation of the issues under the circumstances would simply have been a matter of repetition. Mr. Dudek alleged that newly discovered evidence existed. The motion contains no showing as to the nature of such evidence, on what issue it might be material or from what source it would come. This proceeding is of such interest in Lincoln and the issues were so well known and defined that it would seem almost impossible that new evidence could be found that would be more than merely cumulative and that on matters that are already clear. Such evidence, assuming it to exist, is insufficient to justify a re-trial. Kraus vs. Clark, 81 Neb. 575; Hanks vs. State, 88 Neb. 464; McDonald vs. Brown, 90 Neb. 676. The Commission finds from the evidence that Mr. Dudek and his associates had notice of the original proceedings, under both applica - tions of the Lincoln Traction Company; that they appeared by their attorney in resistance to the granting of the prayer of the company; </seg>
            <seg id="p404">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 477 that they were given every opportunity to cross-examine and offer evi - dence; that they participated in the hearing; that their petition, filed September 24, 1921, was for the purpose of re-trying issues already liti - gated; and that all of the issues presented in their petition were fully litigated and determined in the original proceeding.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4605 In the Matter of the Application of the Union Pacific Railroad Company for Authority to Close Birdwood Station. FINDING AND OPINION Cook, Commissioner: On the 13th day of August, 1921, the Union Pacific Railroad com - pany petitioned the Nebraska State Railway Commission for an order permitting it to close its station at Birdwood, Lincoln county, Nebraska, for the reason that the earnings derived from the operation of said station do not warrant the expense of keeping same open. The petitioners allege that the expense of maintaining an agent at said station is approximately $120 a month. That the total revenues derived therefrom during the year 1921, up to and including the month of June, are as follows: The Commission made a study of the conditions as set forth and find that there is no express handled at this point and very little less than carload freight; that there is neither store nor habitation, except the railroad station. Under these conditions it would be out of the rotal freight receipts rotal ticket sales dumber of cars forwarded dumber of cars received O. Sl.Oi 7: </seg>

The Commission will, under the showing made, favor the elimination of the expense Of an agent at this point temporarily, until the receipts more nearly justify the cost of the service. When said station is closed the railroad company shall leave its waiting room unlocked for the use of passengers and also issue an order to trainmen that all freight unloaded at this point in less than carload lots shall be placed in the freight room at the time Baid freight is unloaded. That it shall instruct its agent at North Platte to give the Birdwood business special attention, in order that there may be no delay in forwarding and receiving carload shipments at this point.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NOS. 4608-4603 In the Matter of the Application of The Lincoln Traction Company to Abandon Certain of Its Tracks and to Re-route Its Cars. In the Matter of the Application of The Lincoln Traction Company for Authority to Discontinue Service and Remove Track from Nine - teenth to Twenty-third Streets on Holdrege Street and One Block South of Holdrege on Twenty-third Street. APPEARANCES : For applicant, F. M. Hall and L. A. Ricketts. For city of Lincoln, C. Petrus Peterson. For H. Herpolsheinier, et al., C. L. Ciark. For city of College View, George A. Adams. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman The two applications as noted above, while heard separately, may be considered together for the reason that they involve similar service, Application No. 4603 being in a sense supplemental to Application No. 4608. For convenience we will discuss Application No. 4608 first. </seg>
            <seg id="p406">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 479 This is an application for authority (a) to remove applicant's trackage on 12th street between N street and South street and to dis - continue service thereon; (b) to transfer the College View cars now traversing the 12th street line to the 17th street route and around the Government Square loop; (c) to connect the 23rd street line and the South 14th street line into a continuous cross-town service; ;and (d) to re-route the South 18th and Randolph cars so as to go around the down down loop from right to left instead of in the opposite direction as at present. In behalf of its application to remove the tracks and readjust its service, applicant shows that it now has lines running south from O street on 10th street, 12th street, 14th street and 17th street. All of these lines extend as far south as South street and two go beyond that point. It is contended that there is no necessity for the operation of lour lines into this territory. The elimination of the 12th street line leaves patrons by whom it is served with opportunity to use either the 10th street or 14th street lines by walking in the most extreme cases only two blocks. It is manifest, therefore, that the people be - tween 10th street and 14th street can be well served without the opera - tion of thcÂ» 12th street line. At the present time cars going to College View go out over 12th street. It is proposed to re-route these cars be - tween South street and the down town section over South 17th street. To patrons in College View and the intermediate territory this service will be as complete and satisfactory as that now provided over 12th street. Some objection was offered on behalf of College View in the fact that parties desiring to go to St. Elizabeth's Hospital, or other points in that immediate vicinity, would be compelled to walk the five blocks from 17th and South should the 12th street service be discon - tined. The traffic between these points is so light as to be almost negligible. It is not improbable that fully as many people will be con - venienced under the change by being able to reach directly points on the South 17th street route. The cars now operating on South 17 street will be discontinued and the service on that line will be provided by the College View cars. This will result in a twenty-minute instead of a fifteen-minute service between A street and South street on 17th. It is proposed, however, during the peak hours to operate additional cars so as to make a ten-minute service on that line. At the present time College View cars and the short-run cars on 12th street operate around the so-called Citizens loop instead of the Government Square loop. The plan of the company, as outlined in its application, is to change this termin'is and operate the College View cars around the Govern - ment Square loop. Patrons and property owners in the terri - tory adjacent to the Citizens loop object to this change. There appears to be good grounds for the objection inasmuch as there is now considerable congestion around the Government Square loop. The dis - continuance of the South 17th street cars and the transfer of the College View cars from the Citizens to the Government Square loop would not </seg>
            <seg id="p407">480 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL, REPORT affect this congestion, but there appears to be good reason for relieving it, as would be done were the College View cars to be retained on the Citizens loop. The continuance of the cars around the Citizens loop, moreover, -would result in a better distribution of the traffic in the down town district. Passengers going to the Burlington or North Western stations would still have opportunity of transfer, and points on the Citizens loop are within easy walking distance of the business section Served by the other terminus. The use of the Citizens loop would also relieve congestion on O street, which at times becomes quite ser - ious and interferes with the maintenance of schedules. The company's objection to the use of the Citizens loop is that under the new routing of the cars it would be necessary to install a curve and switches at 13th and N Street at a cost of $7,000 or $8,000, which expenditure would be unnecessary were the cars to be routed via 13th and O and the Gov - ernment Square loop. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that traffic and service conditions warrant the continued use by the College View cars of the Citizens loop, which involves the following route. leave 13th anÂ«l N street and proceed westward on N street to 11th, thence north on 11th to P street, thence east on P street to 12th street, thence south on 12th to N, thence east on Is' to 13th. Because of conditions existing on P street between ]lth and 12th, it is desired to route the cars on the Citizens loop from left to right Etead of in the opposite direction as at present. Originally there s a double track on P street, but subsequently the north track was aoved, leaving the remaining track to the south of the center. Cars operating around the loop from right to left thus run against the ve - hicle traffic which leads to confusion and the danger of accident. There appears to be no reason whatever why the cars should not be Changed so as to traverse the loop in the opposite direction. As a part of the general plan of readjustment the company asks permission to connect its South 14th street line with its North 23rd street line and operate the two as a single cross-town line. At the present time R requires three cars to maintain a twelve minute head - way on North 23rd street and three cars to maintain a ten-minute headway on South 14th street. By the installation of a curve and switches at 13th and 0 streets and the abandonment of the four blocks of track on Holdrege street it is claimed by applicant that a ten-minute service can be operated over the entire route from 23rd and Holdrege to 14th and Stillwater streets with only four cars. This will result in the elimination of two cars. The readjustment may also call for a shifting of the passing tracks now located on the 23rd street line. In Application No. 4603 the company asks permission to abandon the four blocks of track at the end of its 23rd street line which lie on Holdrege street so as to avoid the cost of paving on the latter s'.rest. </seg>
            <seg id="p408">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 481 Separate hearing was had on that application and it was shown that the company would be put to a cost of approximately $8,000 should It be required to pay its assessment on account of the paving on Holdrego street. In view of the fact that the company has paid no dividends on any of its outstanding stock for about four years, and that during the same period it has accumulated short term obligations of approximately $500,000, it is manifest that it should not be required to make any expenditures that are not absolutely required by the demands of the public service, or that do not give strong promise of reducing operating costs or increasing revenues. The territory now served by the line on Holdrege street is rather sparsely settled and is so situated with reference to railroad tracks and the State Fair grounds as to preclude any extended development in that immediate vicinity. The paving in question not only will not benefit the company from an operating standpoint, but it is generally conceded that it will result directly in the loss of revenue through the increased automobile traffic which will be induced by the roadway im - provement. This fact, coupled with the unfavorable prospects of devel - opment in that territory, and considered in connection with the pre - carious financial condition of the company, would be sufficient reasons in and of themselves for approval of this application. When we take into consideration in addition to these, however, that the elimination of the four extra blocks on the North 23rd street line will make it possible to operate a ten-minute service on a cross-town line and at the same time eliminate the cost of two cars, it becomes all the more necessary. The abandonment of the track appears to be quite im - perative. The company has proposed installing a "Y" in the street one block south of Holdrege street with the idea of turning its cars in this street and backing them up to Holdrege. This would appear to be an awkward arrangement and the Commission is of the opinion that the T should be installed in Holdrege street. This should insure some - what better service to the people boarding the cars at that point and will render unnecessary the construction of tracks in the street one block south of that point. Very substantial economies are claimed by the company as a re - sult of the various readjustments above outlined. Three cars will ba removed from the South 17th street line and two cars as a result of the combination of the North 23rd and South 14th street lines. Applicant has calculated the saving in car hours, based on its present operating costs, and finds the saving to amount to $2,591.50 per month, or $31,098 per year. In addition it expects to recover, as a result of the abandonment of the South 12th street tracks, a large amount of material which can be utilized in other portions of the system. All of the rail will be available for this purpose and its re- </seg>
            <seg id="p409">482 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT covery will obviate the necessity of the purchase of new rail for re - placements already anticipated. The same will be true, but to a lesser degree, as to ties, poles and trolley and feeder wire. The use of this material should substantially reduce the company's expenditures for maintenance and replacements during the next two or three years and thus becomes an important factor in its ever present problem of reduc - ing operating costs. The value of the property thus removed, less the E3t of removal, should be deducted from the property accounts of the mpany. Appropriate entries in its books, clearly describing this de - ction, should be made. As previously indicated, the Commission is of the opinion that the changes as prayed for, except as they have been modified in our find - ings, should be approved. They constitute a constructive program, Iook - ing to the elimination of duplicate trackage and the accomplishment of necessary economies without sorious impairment of the service this company is rendering to the public. In fact it appears likely that when the readjustments are completed the service in several respects will be E proved. What is much more important, they promise to rescue this npany from ultimate disaster and preserve to the city of Lincoln and burbs a system of street railway transportation. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that The Lincoln Traction company be, and the same hereby is authorized to abandon and remove its tracks on South 12th street between N street and South street, and to discon - tinue the operation of cars thereon; it is further authorized to transfer its College View cars from the said South 12th street line to the South 17th street line between South street and the business section, said cars to be operated over the so-called Citizens loop as follows: from 13th and N street westward on N street to 11th street, thence north on 11th street to P street, thence east on P street to 12th street, thence south on 12th street to N street, thence east on N street to 13th street. PRO - VIDED, however, that the above authorized removal and abandonment of the South 12th street tracks between N and South streets shall not become operative until all necessary track facilities whereby College View cars may be operated around the so-called Citizens loop, as above set forth, shall have been constructed and completed and cars actually routed and running that way.

Dwlght Ford, attorney for the Brittan Electric Light and Power company of Arnold, Nebraska. Mr. Ford's question is this: Has the State Railway Commission jurisdiction of the security issues of non-incorporated companies; or over so-called "common law" or "declaration of trust " companies. The question should be answered in the negative Under the Stock and Bonds Act, Statutes 1913, Section 758, it its provided that "A common carrier or public service corporation organized and incorporated" may issue certain securities only after securing the permission of the State Railway Commission. No good reason is apparent why such permission is required for corpora - tions and not for other public service concerns but the legislature clearly restriced the power of the Commission to corporations. "Common law" trust or declaration of trust can not be classed as corporations. They are not corporations in any sense; in fact they owe their origin to an attempt to avoid the obligations placed on corporations. No such form of organization is recognized in Nebraska. They are, generally speaking, merely partnerships, over which there is no control as to security issues by the Commission." It thus 'appearing that the Commission has no jurisdiction in the matter at hand it was directed that the application be dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that, because of lack of jurisdiction of the Commission to consider questions involved, the application herein be and the same is hereby dismissed of record.

            <seg id="p412">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 485 Authority to Publish on One Day's Notice Reduced Rates on Grain, Hay and Products of Grain. OPINION OF FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Under date of October 20, 1921, the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion rendered its report on an extensive investigation of rates on grain and hay, undertaken by it during the month of August, and in that re - port found the existing rates on hay and grain and grain products to be unreasonable, recommending to all carriers in western and mountain Pacific groups a reduction of said rates on wheat by an amount equal to one-half of the increase of August 26, 11)20, and further, a reduction on corn and other coarse grains by an additional ten per cent. The finding declared that if the carriers did not do this voluntarily on or before November 20, 1921, an order would be entered. The carriers involved did not follow the recommendation of the Interstate Commerce Commission but proffered instead a reduction or ten per cent on all products of garden, farm, orchard and ranch throughout the United States, except in the New England group. Under date of November 21. 1921, the Interstate Commerce Commission issued its order based on its findings of October 20, requiring the carriers in the territory named tf&gt; reduce, on or before December 27^ interstate rates on wheat and hay by an amount equal to one-half the amount of the increase authorized August 26, 1920. in Ex Parte 74, rates on corn and other coarse grain by an additional ten per cent, and on grain products by such reductions as would continue the relationship now existing between the product and the grain from which they are made. Subsequent thereto, the carriers asked for a rehearing on the matter of hay and grain rates which rehearing was denied.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: The immediate cause of this investigation was government control of telephone companies during the late war. The postmaster general in August, 1918, soon after the president took over control of wire com - panies, inaugurated a series of charges for installation of telephones, disconnects of telephones, change of name, or supersedes, and inside moves. This first order was primarily for the purpose of discouraging telephone development as a war measure. In November, 1918, the post - master general amended the order and put into effect a rate of $3.50 installation charge, the same amount for a move or disconnect, $3.00 for an inside move and $1.50 for supersede or change of name. These rates remained in effect until the end of the period of federal control and were thereafter extended by action of this Commission for a period during which careful consideration of the principles and rate levels might be given. To that end a hearing was called in the early winter of 1919-1920 </seg>
            <seg id="p416">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 489 for the purpose of considering whether to continue some sort of service connection charges, and, if so, at what rates the continuance should be authorized. Elaborate exhibits were presented by the Nebraska Tele - phone Company, predecessor of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Com - pany of Nebraska at the time of this investigation. Less elaborate studies were presented by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and a very considerable number of independents presented their views with more or less fragmentary data. The Nebraska Telephone Company pro - posed a new set of service connection charges, as follows: Business Residence Instru- Instru- Instru- Instru- ment in ment not ment in ment not place in place place in place P. B. X. trunks same as instrument not in place P. B. X. stations $1.00 each; Inside move within one room $1.00; Inside move from room to room $2.00; Changing type of equipment $2.00; Private branch switchboards to be handled under special provl - visions, and supersedes in telephone service where no lapse of service occurs to be on the same basis as when there has been a lapse of service, viz.: the charge for instrument in place. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company mildly opposed the proposition of the Nebraska Telephone Company and asked that existing rates for service connections be continued, this attitude being govern - ed by revenue considerations alone. The independents, for the most part, favored the contention of the Lincoln company, although one or two did not favor the continuation of the service connection charges. For several years before the postmaster general tried out his theories of operating telephone companies the Nebraska Commission had favored some sort of an installation charge which would protect both the company and the long-time subscribers against the heavy er - pense of the shifting telephone population. It had authorized a number of companies in the state to publish and collect an installation charge of $2.00. This figure was arrived at not after particular studies as to costs involved which might not be capitalized, but rather for deterrent effects. These orders provided that the installation payment should finally be absorbed by the telephone company on the theory that the rental rate included the cost of an occasional move. Obviously this theory, on which the earlier orders of the Commis - sion were bottomed, has not been tenable for a number of years.

            <seg id="p417">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 490 of operation mounted so rapidly that net earnings were rather uncer - tain even when aided by the extra collections made for installations and moves, such collections never being refunded. Had the theory applied by the Nebraska Commission in the early days been followed and these refunds been allowed the companies would have been in more serious financial condition. In fact, increases in rates would have been generally necessary beyond the points where they were set. Action by the Commission, following the investigation, was pur - posely delayed. Close check on the telephone companies of the state generally indicated clearly that such revenues as were being received from the service connection charges were essential to the maintenance of proper service, and further essential if additional increases in regular rates were to be avoided. That condition is not entirely past yet. There are, however, hopeful signs on the horizon. The prices of poles have reluctantly been reduced. Such common labor as is needed by telephone companies is now cheaper. Cost of operating automobiles has gone down and jt is not a wild guess that the tenacious manufacturers of batteries, telephone instruments and switchboard equipment will, in the near future, be required by competitive conditions to make some reduc - tions in prices. These signs have led the Commission to take up for "disposition the question of service connection charges, which charges, since the return of wire companies to their owners by the government, have been made under temporary authority. In the telephone business the installation of a new instrument, or the moving by a subscriber from one location to another, is accom - panied by peculiar expenses not realized by any other public utility. When a new customer is acquired by an electric light or gas company a meter is installed and the wiring or piping is furnished by the house - holder. A particular account is opened and the transaction of acquiring the new customer is ended. No one except the company and the cus - tomer is interested. The service is tapped on to a main channel over which the commodity is sent to divers other customers. When a cus - tomer moves from one location to another the process at the central office simply involves the customer and the company. With the tele - phone business it is quite different. Everybody in the community Is potentially interested in what every other subscriber does with his telephone. The new subscriber requires a complete little plant all his own, a miniature switchboard, a distribution system from his property to the oentral office, and an individual instrument. In place of a few large trunks over which electric current is passed at high pressure ,or large gas or water mains through which the service is furnished to a large number, each single line telephone subscriber must be individually taken care of throughout the whole distance from central plant to resi - dence. This requires a greatly complicated record keeping. Then, too, when John Smith installs a telephone not only he and </seg>
            <seg id="p418">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 491 the company are interested, but everybody who may have occasion to talk to John Smith and the telephone company must have such records as will enable it promptly to satisfy the demands of all those who de - sire to talk to John Smith. If John Smith moves from one location to another the whole community is potentially interested in that fact and the telephone company, serving that community in its peculiar and par - ticular field, must stand ready to furnish the necessary information as to what telephone service John Smith now has and to do so in a large exchange requires very complicated cross-indexing, quickly available to each of the departments on which the public may have occasion to call by reason of the action of John Smith. In years gone by the expenses incident to the keeping of thest 1 records have been paid out of the general funds; that is, all subscribers paid a percentage of the total bill for this purpose regardless of the amount of expense incurred by each of them in this keeping and chang - ing of records. There was no particular segregation of expenses. The public was somewhat careless and that carelessness added to the oper - ating costs and made rates higher than would otherwise have been necessary. Temporary disconnects during vacation, or temporary re - moval of telephones in fits of pique, meant but little to the subscriber because they cost that particular subscriber nothing. The whole body of subscribers paid the bill. The necessity for some corrective measures was seen by the Ne - braska Commission when it authorized certain service connection charges. These charges, as has been said, were not for the purpose of paying segregated parts of the record-keeping, but rather to put the brakes on whimsical actions on the part of subscribers which might be avoided without serious inconvenience to the subscribers, and if not avoided might be paid in part by those causing the expense. More careful con - sideration of corrective measures was brought about by the rapidly mounting costs of operation. No student of telephone finances in the last few years is unaware that these costs outstripped the increases in revenues either by advances in rates or by rates and larger volume com - bined. It was necessary to perfect economies. Thus came into existence more complete service connection charges which would, in part, provide revenues to offset specific costs, the revenues to come from those caus - ing the -costs; in part, to produce economies by still further discouraging unnecessary expenses. It has not been easy for the public to accommodate Itself to the experience of paying service connection charges, largely because for almost two decades these services have been without cost. It would be easier to appreciate the value of the service connection charges dur - ing the period of the war if it could be understood that had not these additional sources of revenue been presented the rates for general serv - ice would have been necessarily so much higher than they have been. </seg>
            <seg id="p419">492 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The rather refined rules of service connection charges, as now In effect, include (a) certain costs where service is installed for the brand new subscriber, or for the subscriber who is new in the particular local - ity; (b) temporary disconnects or removes of telephone instrumentali - ties on the premises while occupied by the subscriber continuously; (c) moving of the subscriber's equipment from place to place within the premises or changing the type of the equipment; and (d) the succes - sion of one individual subscriber to the instrumentalities used by a predecessor at any one locality. We will consider these in their order, INSTALLATION CHARGES The justification for these charges, as presented by the companies with large exchanges in the chief cities of the state, may he classed under three heads: 1. To meet the costs of installation which are necessariiy incurred but which cannot be capitalized. 2. Advance payments to cover the labor of removal of the tele - phone at some future date and to cover also the loss of material which will accompany such removal. 3. A deterrent against the ordering of telephone service by persons whose need for such service is of short duration. The uncapitalized costs include the making of records in the various departments handling the work in the larger cities, or making up and Eping of cable records, somewhat complicated in their nature, and working out in extremely usable form of data for directories and for information departments maintained by telephone companies. Most elaborate studies were presented in explanation of the com - plex records, more puzzling no doubt in the telling than complicated in the doing. To the average mind it would appear that unnecessary re - finements had been worked out in the matter of records until now they are ponderous and needlessly costly.. All possible expenses should be eliminated in this period of depression, even though proper expenses in normal times. It is unnecessary to discuss in full detail the elements which make up the uncapitalized cost in the keeping of records, with the exception of two or three elements. Against the new subscriber and the subscriber who moves is set up by these companies the cost of three out of four directories furnished and distributed each year and the cost of prepara - tion of the directories. Were it not for the new subscribers and the subscribers who move one directory per annum would be sufficient. Likewise, there is charged against these new subscribers the expensive </seg>
            <seg id="p420">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 493 and elaborately indexed information cards which are constantly called into use largely by reason of moves, new changes and new subscribers. It does appear that the information contained in directories is just as important to the patron who desires to talk to the new subscriber, or the subscriber who has moved, as it is to that subscriber himself and like - wise the data in the hands of the information clerks. To us the com - pany has hardly justified the segregation of these two items against the floating telephone public as compared with its payment out of the rentals paid by all subscribers. Likewise it would appear that certain other of the smaller charges more properly belong to revenue account - ing and revenue collecting. LOSS BY REASON OF REMOVALS A more important reason presented for service connection charges related to the labor necessary to remove equipment and the material lost to the company by reason of the removals. This is no small cost. Sometimes it involves merely the sending of an employe from the central office to remove a telephone instrument and carry it back to the store room, together with the changes in the records and accounts of the com - pany to show what has taken place. Sometimes it involves not only the removing of the instruments but taking out the wire from inside the house and sometimes it even involves removing the drop wire from the main lead to the house and taking it away. The wire which is removed from inside the house cannot again be used ordinarily as the normal subscriber does not desire patched wire, particularly if it is visible wiring. The extent of these moves is almost startling. In Omaha during the first six months of one year studied, 4,605 telephones were installed. There was either cessation of use altogether or a move from the original location to some other location of these 4,605 new subscribers, as follows: During the first three months 815 quit service or moved to another location; by the end of six months 1,700; in nine months 2,295; during the first year 2,727; and by the end of two and one-half years 3,587 had either ceased being subscribers or had moved to other locations which involved definite and certain ex - pense. The Lincoln company, from a considerable study, found that the loss in outside and inside wiring, where telephones were ultimately removed from the premises, was $3.36 per phone. There was tendency on the part of witnesses to conclude that these figures represented the turn-over in the use of telephone instrumntali - ties. This conclusion hardly seems warranted if it is a study only of the new installations for a particular period and must necessarily involve a large number of people who constantly flit from home to home and must also necessarily exclude the large block of permanent residence and business subscribers who seldom or never change location. </seg>
            <seg id="p421">494 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Tho Bell company presented figures to show the average cost for new installation in Omaha of $7.12 which could not be capitalized, and that the general cost at all exchanges outside of Omaha is $5.57; in addition to the capitalized telephone instruments, drop wire, inside wire and labor of installation. It was exhaustively argued, with exhibits in support thereof, that the cost of a move was equally great and that there was practically no difference in cost where one subscriber suc - ceeded to the instrumentalities of another. Whether these conclusions are well taken depends entirely on whether the items of expense can equitably be allocated, as was done by those who presented the data, or whether some portions of these expense items would not more equit - ably be borne by the general telephone-using public. The added factor to be considered is, of course, the question of policy as to how much the expense of moving subscribers and ol installing new subscribers ought to be paid specifically and how much ought to be borne by the telephone - using community. THE SHORT-TIME USER No small factor in the consideration of this charge lies in the effort to deter short-time users from taking telephone service. This floating element from apartment house to apartment house, from desk space in an office room to desk space in another office room, and from town to town, is more pronounced in the larger cities than in the country towns and in the rural service. From the figures already presented it is evident that in Omaha during the period studied eighty per cent of those subscribing during a definite period moved or quit service within three years. At Grand Island sixty-eight per cent moved or quit service and the composite figure of seven exchanges of the Bell Telephone Com - pany in Nebraska outside of Omaha was sixty-four per cent moving or eliminating service. While the Commission has no figures from inde - pendents serving a majority of rural subscribers no doubt the data would show a still smaller turn-over. If the figures on cost of taking care Of the move of a subscriber from one locatioVi to another are anywhere near correct it must at once be evident that the short-term subscriber remaining in service less than three months is handled at a heavy loss by the company and that, in all events the subscriber who moves occas - sionally costs the company more money than the subscriber who seldom moves. If service is to be furnished on a cost basis these facts must be taken into consideration. In how far service should be furnished on a basis of cost to each individual served is an important question not only as regards service connection charges, but as regards monthly subscribers' rates. There can be no question that the short-time user should either be discouraged from taking telephone service or should pay approxi - mately what he costs the company. Unfortunately it cannot be told in </seg>
            <seg id="p422">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 495 advance whether the subscriber is short-time or not as he himself either does not know or will not tell. The extremely short-time user cannot be charged an extra amount at the close of the period of service because there is no proper economical method of collecting it. Hence, the deter - rent element must be surely one of the factors to consider in fixing charges for installation. At whatever figure these charges are placed it amounts merely to localizing the production of revenue against cer - tain subscribers who cost the company more and relieving to just that extent the more permanent patrons. To be effective this deterrent factor must be more pronounced where the average monthly telephone rate is higher and vice versa. It is our conclusion that service connection charges should be con - tinued permanently in Nebraska but that these charges should be graded. It would appear proper that they be somewhat higher for business phones than for residence phones as the record shows that business service is more unstable than residence service. It would also appear proper that the rates be higher in the cities where the turn-over is greatest and where the plants are most complicated inasmuch as the greater the com - plication the greater the cost of keeping the records and of making the changes. SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGE (Instrument not in place but inside wiring and drop in position.) In dealing with this class of service the assumption must be that at the time of the original installation an installation charge was paid, a portion of which charge is to cover the cost of removal and the loss of drop and inside wiring. Inasmuch as the drop and inside wiring are in place that portion of the original installation charge paid for the pur - pose of offsetting this loss still remains in the possession of the com pany. To pay another installation charge in like amount means that an additional credit is applied to cover the loss of inside wiring and drop wiring and this may be repeated several times. Obviously if the theory of the installation charge is sound the same amount of charge ought not be made where a portion of the facilities are in place. Very prob - ably the answer to this statement is that the total cost of removal and loss and all other expenses incident to the move or change is only partly represented in the installation charge and hence if the charge is repeated it more nearly approaches the actual cost experience. Here it appears a question of policy as to how much of the charge, if not all, 6hall be directly allocated to a particular subscriber. From the sub - scriber's point of view (and all telephone companies should desire that their subscribers see the reasons for charges made) it is difficult to understand why the charge in the instance under consideration should be equally high with an original installation charge. The Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p423">496 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Is of the opinion that some differential should exist as to the service connection charge under the circumstances under discussion as com - pared with an original installation charge. SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGE (Instrument in place but lapse of service having occurred.) No real difference exists in the costs under these circumstances when compared with the costs where the instrument is not in place as the cost of re-establishing the instrument becomes a capital charge. The company loses revenue while the telephone is in place and is idle. In our opinion, under the circumstances here discussed, the subscriber should pay the same service connection charge as he would pay where the house has been wired but where the telephone must be reconnected or re-installed. There should, however, be the option to the subscriber to pay for the lapsed period of service and be then considered in the same category as a supersede or change of name transfer. SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGE (Supersede or change of name.) The circumstances herein described are where one subscriber moves out of a location and another moves in with no lapse in period of service and where the expense consists of changing of office records and an inspection of the instrument and wiring to see that it is in first-class condition. Both the Lincoln and the Bell companies testified in detail that there was no particular difference in the costs under these circum - stances from the costs under circumstances heretofore discussed, in - cluding original installation. They urged that the same kind of a trip must be made from the central office for purposes of inspecting the phone and testing it out and making such repairs as are essential, and that the same directory expenses are incurred and the same work in preparing the data for the information departments. It is to us a mat - ter of more than passing doubt as to whether or not the inspection of the instrument, and the minor repairs which may be made to it, is not a maintenance expense, either deferred maintenance of a predeces - sor's use of the instrumentality or anticipated maintenance of a future date. The doubt in the minds of the Commission is sufficiently strong to warrant the conclusion that the charge for this particular service should be made against the general maintenance funds. There is no question from the evidence before us but what there are costs in connection with the supersede or change of name which can be approximately allocated, varying with the practices of the com - pany under the circumstances, and with the complexity of the plant involved. Very likely the allocation can no more readily be made than can maintenance charges be allocated to particular subscriber's equip- </seg>
            <seg id="p424">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 497 ment, or the collection expense, or even the return on the investment. It has always been considered a question of policy that these latter charges against the operating revenue should be generally spread rather than be allocated. In the case of the supersede or change of name it again becomes a matter of policy largely as to where the charge shall be placed; that is, whether against the general revenues or in allocation against the particular subscriber. A majority of the Commission be - lieves that the record substantially proves the necessity for a change of name charge on the Omaha and Lincoln exchanges because of the very great complexity of the plants and of the traffic and commercial organ - izations essential to proper operation in those exchanges. The majority does not think that this charge should be extended to the smaller ex - changes within the state. This conclusion is a question of policy al - most entirely. A minority of the Commission believes that the evidence warrants some sort of a service connection charge in instances of super - sedes or change of name in various other exchanges in the state where the plants are relatively complex and the organizations, both traffic and commercial, are intricate. INSIDE MOVES These expenses are caused only by the subscriber. No other sub - scriber on an exchange is interested. It is a matter of indifference to a calling subscriber where the instrument of the person called is located or the type of such instrument. Whatever cost is incurred by reason of inside moves is due to the convenience of the particular subscriber Before any charge for this service was made in years gone by a great deal of cost piled up against the operating companies by reason 01 inside moves. It is our opinion that a charge for the entire cost of an inside move, plus a reasonable OTerhead and profit, should be made against the subscriber asking for the inside move. It is recognized thai this means extra bookkeeping, that the amount of the charge cannot be ascertained definitely in advance, and that it may cause many con troversies and for that reason it is opposed by many, if not all, of the companies. The Commission recommends a rule placing against the subscriber causing the inside move the entire cost of that move, plus a reasonable profit. Telephone companies within the state will be per - mitted, however, to file rules for specific charges for classes of inside moves, which will constitute the proper schedule for such services unless specifically rejected by the Commission. In case no such rules are filed, service on a cost plus basis will be the legal schedule. This action of the Commission is not intended to cover the expenses incident to the move of P. B. X. equipment, which shall in all events be on a cost plus basis. We now come to the question of whether charges for service con - nections shall be on a flat basis throughout the state, regardless of the </seg>
            <seg id="p425">498 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT nature of the exchanges, or shall be on a sliding scale. The North - western Bell Telephone Company urges a sliding scale. The Lincoln company, respondent herein, and various independents, urge a flat LAt the time of the hearing testimony was taken from a consid - ble number of representatives of independent companies, both small and large. Almost without exception they failed to have the proper idea of what the service connection charge is for and were almost united in the belief at the beginning of the hearing that they were being paid for the cost of labor and material for installations regardless of the fact that such labor and material appeared in the capital account. Practically without exception they presented no evidence indicating that the general cost for service connection charges even approximated the amounts that had been charged for the services. If the keeping of records and the cost of removes amounted to any considerable money the companies involved had failed to be impressed thereby. The case presented by the Nebraska Telephone Company, predecessor of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, was largely made up from experiences in Omaha, and that of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company from ex - periences in Lincoln. The testimony as to similarity of costs at smaller exchanges was rather general in nature. Some figures were presented as to the uncapitalized cost of service connection charges at smaller exchanges, but these were not explained in detail. From the point of view of the actual uncapitalized costs and of the deterrent factor, which is an important consideration, the Commission is of the opinion that sliding scales are more to be desired than a flat charge such as was made by the director general. Some Nebraska companies ignored the director generals order to make service connection charges and never put such charges into effect. Under order of this Commission, and subsequent to the return of wire companies to their owners, these companies were exempt from making the service connection charges. At this time the order herein will be considered to include all commercial telephone companies within the state, with permission to any and all of such companies to file individual applications for modification, if modification is justified by local and peculiar conditions. Such applications for modification should be filed not later than December 1, 1921.

            <seg id="p427">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 500 RESOLUTION NO. 50 Fthe Matter of Service Connection Charges by Telephone Companies in Nebraska. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner In accordance with the specific provisions of the findings in the or - iginal order herein, the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company have filed respectively ap - plications for modification of the general order for application to their properties. Formal hearings were not had on these supplemental applications but the questions at issue were carefully gone into in informal hear - ings. Both companies felt that the classifications set forth in the general order would cause some irritation on the part of the public which might be eliminated if certain suggestions made by them were followed. I On the part of the Nebraska, company it was proposed to modify follows : l. To consolidate classifications A and B under the general heading "Main Stations- 1 â Instruments not in Place"; 2. To consolidate classifications C and D under the general heading "Instruments in Place' 1 and to apply slightly different rat - ings to this classification No. C by reason of such consolidation ; 3. To make a charge of $2.50 installation fee for each station attached to a private branch exchange in place of the charge of $1.00 provided in the general order; 4. To substitute specific charges for inside moves in place of the cost of the service. Such substitution was specifically allowed in the main finding. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company proposed the same consolidations of classifications A and B and of C and D, the same in - crease in installation charges for stations attached to P. B. X. boards, and a flat charge for inside moves, depending upon the nature of the move. Evidence was presented by both companies that the number of cases of installation arising under the Commission's subdivision B where specific charges for installation were set forth at places where Crop and inside wiring remains in place were relatively few, when it was considered that usually the new subscriber at a location where a phone had previously been in use generally desired changes in the </seg>
            <seg id="p428">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 501 inside wiring and the further reason that it is the common practice of both companies to permit telephones to remain in place a considerable length of time where there is reason to believe that the new tenant of the property will desire telephone service. Insofar as the merging of the two classifications would cause the charges in classification A where Otherwise the charges of classification B would be made, it is an in - crease in the installation charge as compared with the original order. Both companies were unanimous in stating that a different charge for the taking on of a subscriber where the instrument is in place, such ttiffering charge dependent upon whether there was a lapse of service between the two subscribers or not, is a constant source of annoyance to subscribers. The officers of the two companies speak from abundant experience. The proposed consolidation of the Commission's classifica - tions C and D would have the effect of reducing the charges to any subscriber who would otherwise fall under classification C. It is proposed by both companies that the supercede or change-of name charge should be applied more widely than to Lincoln and Omaha and in support of this contention it was pointed out that with each change or supercede there must be left idle on the switchboard the location of the preceding subscriber until such time as a new directory is printed, and it was further pointed out that wherever exchanges are large enough to require multiple switchboards there is a very compli edited task of wiring the new subscriber onto the switchboard, evea though only a supersede, that requires a considerable amount of time which is not required in the more simple switchboards of one and two positions. The Commission considers that there is force in this con - tention, and the order herein will provide for the extension of the ( harge for supersede or change of name to all exchanges where multiple switchboards are necessary and in use. The Northwestern Bell com - pany has asked that the supersede or change-of-name charge at Omaha be left unaffected because of the very great complexity of cable lines and intercommunicating exchanges, all of which are affected by changes of subscribers. The Lincoln company asks a similar conclusion. On full consideration the Commission does not believe the two situations comparable. It will approve a charge of $1.50 for supersede or change of name on the Omaha exchange and a charge of $1.25 for similar services on the Lincoln exchange. It will approve also a charge of $1.00 both on business and residence and rural, where the exchange is sup - plied by and operated in conjunction with multiple switchboards. In the original order herein the Commission cancelled supersede or change of name at all exchanges outside of Omaha and Lincoln. By the concession made above such cancellation will be somewhat more restricted. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company asks for a charge of fifty cents for supersede or change of name, business, residence </seg>
            <seg id="p429">502 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT and rural, at all of its smaller exchanges. For the reasons assigned in the original opinion this portion of the application will be denied. Provision E of the original opinion will not be modified. Regarding the Commission's subdivision F, both applicants ask to have the charge increased to $2.50 for the installation of all stations attached to the switchboard. The original application herein and the testimony relating thereto was not on the basis of this charge and there is no evidence now before the Commission to warrant the full concession. On further consideration, however, of the fact that the Stations attached to a private branch exchange are frequently spread over a very large business building or plant, with a correspondingly large amount of inside wiring, most of which is lost whenever the private branch exchange is removed, we will modify the order, as re - gards these two applicants, to $1.50. Both applicants have filed schedule of charges for inside moves, dependent upon whether the move is within the same room or in differ - ent rooms, and while the two applicants are not in agreement as to the amounts of such charges neither will be rejected. It is understood of course that both an inside move and an install do not take place at the same time. No change is asked regarding the Commission's subdivisiou H, except that in the Northwestern Bell application the words "at re - quest of subscriber" are omitted. This is probably an oversight, as changes in type made voluntarily by the company ought not to be the reason for an extra charge to subscribers ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that, effective on one day's notice, an emergency existing. the following charges for service connections shall be made, respect - ively, by the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Nebraska and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, to-wit: NORTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY A Main Stations â Instruments not in place: Exchange Classes â¢ Business Omaha _ $5.00 1,000 subscribers or more 3.00 600 to 1,000 subscribers 2.50 Less than 600 subscribers 2.00 Residence and Rural $3.50 2.00 1.75 1.50 Main Stations â Instruments in place: Exchange Classes Business Omaha $1.50 Residence and Rural $1.50 </seg>

(SEAL) RESOLUTION NO 54 and APPLICATION NO. 4337 In the Matter of the Investigation by the Commission of the Finances Of the Stanton Independent Telephone Company. In the Matter of the Application of the Stanton Independent Telephone Company for Authority to Issue Securities. APPEARANCES: For defendant and applicant, Powell &amp; Wilson, attorneys. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Under date of December 23, 1919, the Commission issued an Order to show cause directed to the Stanton Independent Telephone com - pany, calling attention to the apparent high rate of dividends paid by that company on its outstanding stock and to the probable lack of sufficient expenditures for maintenance, and directing said company to appear before the Commission on January 16, 1920, to show cause why </seg>
            <seg id="p432">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 505 the Commission should not fix the value of the property for dividend purposes and the maximum percentage to be paid as dividends, and to make such further order as would properly protect the service against insufficient maintenance. For various reasons the hearing was postponed until May 29, 1920. at which time hearing was held at the offices of the Commission at Lincoln. On June 15, 1920, the Stanton Independent Telephone company filed an application, setting forth in brief a history of the development cf the company, a claim as to existing property, a statement as to neces - sity for restoring depreciation reserve funds, borrowed theretofore for extensions, in order to make necessary repairs and replacements of the existing property, and asking the authority of the Commission to issue a stock dividend of $20,000 so that the total outstanding capital stock, prior to the sales of additional stock, might properly represent the interest of the original stockholders in the properties. The company asked that the testimony taken at the hearing in May on the ex parte investigation be considered the testimony in support of the application and this motion on the part of the company was sustained. At the close of the hearing on the investigation by the Commission, it was determined that an inventory of the property by the Commission was essential. The company had filed an inventory, but the Commission considered it proper that this inventory be checked independently. Such inventory was made by the Commission's engineers in July, 1920, and on February 15 and 16, 1921, the case was reopened for the introduction of evidence on values built up by the Commission's experts and to give the defendant company an opportunity to cross-examine on such evidence. We Will deal with the investigation by the Commission and with the application of the company in one order, as all essential facts relative to both matters are contained in the same report. The predecessor of the Stanton Independent Telephone company was the Nebraska Telephone company, which installed an exchange at Stanton about the year 1900. The exchange was built according to the standard plans of the Nebraska Telephone company and was fullT metallic. That company had a policy in those days of refusing to ex - tend service into rural districts, which policy caused very much dls satisfaction on the part of the farmers who desired telephone service. Arrangements were, therefore, partly made for the development of a competing evchange at Stanton. Largely because of this the Nebraska Telephone company sold its properties in Stanton to a partnership com - posed of H. B. Miller and A. W. Forbes. At the time of the transfer the exchange consisted of sixty-six stations but did not include real estate. The testimony indicates that the property purchased had cost </seg>
            <seg id="p433">506 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL, REPORT the Nebraska Telephone company $3,600. The testimony is inconclusive as to the amount paid for the properties, but it was between $1,500 and $3,000. It alleges that a conservative value of the purchase was $3,000 and that any amount less than that paid by the partnership was merely the advantage of a good bargain. Later the partnership bought some toll line properties of the Nebraska Telephone company, which, due to rearrangement, the latter company was finding it necessary to abandon or "scrap." The evidence indicates that these properties, part of which still exist, were purchased at very good advantage by defendant company. A careful record of receipts and expenditures was kept !iy the company from the beginning, but no effort was made to allocate the ex - penditures in accordance with approved methods for this kind of utility. All cancelled checks and vouchers were available for a study and such a study was made by a witness employed by the company and the Tesults of that study were embodied as an exhibit in the hearing, with the expenditures separated as between (1) maintenance, additions and betterments; (2) operating expenses; (3) general expenses; (4) de - ductions; (5) dividends. It was impossible to separate purely main - tenance expenses from additions and betterments in attempting to tra^e the growth of the property and applicant, therefore, performed this separation in more or less arbitrary manner to reflect the best judg - ment of the company as to the amount of money spent for current main - tenance which would not reflect in any growth to the property. This study of the finances of the company indicates some very important facts, pointing in part to reasons for the very prospero-js condition of the company. No livery expense was incurred during tne first two years and a very light expense for this purpose throughout the history of the company. No rent was charged for the first two years of the present company and no charge for heat and light between the years 1905 and 1911 inclusive. For the years 1905, 1906 and 1907 the two owners were paid no salaries and during the same years there was no legal expense, no charge for stationery, printing or traveling, these items having been met from the private assets of the owners. During the years 1905 to 1909 inclusive no dividends were paid. One of the owners devoted all his time to engineering, superintending and actual construction work. The other partner did the buying of supplies, kept the records and did the collecting and all other indoor duties, but worked only part time. These facts are mentioned because of their bearing on the growth of the company in considering the historical cost of the properties. No cash from outside sources was invested in the company other than that amount not exceeding $3,000 which was paid for the property in the latter part of the year 1904. All of the money now represented in the investment in the Stanton Independent Telephone company came from </seg>
            <seg id="p434">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 507 the revenues of the company, except such items as already have been denoted that must have been paid from the private exchequers of the partners. These would include the rent for the period named, which rent, as we understand it, . was donated by one of the. partners. The heat and the light was presumably likewise donated by the partner who owned the building in which the exchange was located and in which that partner conducted a private business. Livery was donated by one of the partners for a stated period. Traveling expenses, when necessary, for the first six years of the existence of the company were paid from private income. It must be understood that both part - ners had independent sources of income. In 1909 a corporation was formed with two stockholders. Fifteen thousand dollars in common stock was issued to represent what the owners considered was a fair value of the property at that time. This outstanding stock has not been changed. At the time of the incorpora - tion the company comprised about 350 subscribers, all, or nearly all of whom were receiving metallic service. It is quite possible at this time the outstanding stock exceeded somewhat the actual value of the properties and slightly more than the assumed sacrifice of the owners. From the time of the incorporation to date the company has paid from ten to twenty per cent on the outstanding stock, annually, as dividends and has in the meantime grown to an exchange comprising 681 sub - scribers. In thus growing the company used all proper reserves for depreciation in financing the extensions and the record appeared quite clear that it actually sacrificed more or less in current upkeep. The amounts shown by reports to the Commission to have been spent for maintenance were less than proper maintenance, although it must be said that the company"s allocations for maintenance were more or less arbitrary thr.&gt;. ghout this period. In attempting to show the sources of the property, the company presented an exhibit made up from a study of its records. This exhibit shows that there was actually spent for materials and labor in 1905 to 1919 inclusive $46,644, excluding all donated services and materials as have already been discussed. To this the company added $7,650 for services of the one partner who actively took part in the construction program, and subtracted from the total $22,999, representing a more oÂ» less arbitrary allocation for maintenance, which allocation was on the "i&gt;asis of five per cent of the cost of the property for the first eight years and eight per cent thereafter. By such a computation the exhibit ar - rives at the conclusion that the historical cost of the properties was $30,295. This figure does not include any other donations heretofore discussed except for the services of one of the partners and makes no allowance whatever for donations by subscribers in the matter of haul - ing and pole setting, which, the testimony indicated occurred in this company as in all other similar companies in the state where </seg>
            <seg id="p435">FOURTEENTH ANNUAL. REPORT 508 the demand for service, particularly in. the country, exceeded the capacity of the company to supply promptly. We are thus con - fronted by the conclusion that the historical cost of these properties, at the end of 1919 was not less than $30,295 and exceeded that amount by whatever results in the way of physical property were secured from donations of services and materials. This figure does not take into account the depreciation, which the company's own exhibit, its own testimony, and the testimony of the Commission's expert indicate was quite heavy. The company presented another exhibit attempting to give a theo - retical study to represent the sacrifice of the partners within the rule of reason as to rate of return. This exhibit pictures a proper rate of return at ten per cent, concludes that there was no accrued depreci - ation after 1912 that was not currently restored, omits consideration of the stock dividend of $12,000 in 1909 to represent accumulations in the property, and otherwise is not an exhibit which can be used at all satisfactorily- A computation as to the sacrifice of the partners in the develop - ment of this business, allowing them annually a conservative figure for services, a dividend at seven per cent annually on the accumulations of sacrifice, and the quite arbitrary estimate of other donations of services and materials, would indicate that the entire sacrifice of the stockholders during the seventeen years of ownership, giving proper credit for the bargains in purchases of standing property, did not exceed $18,000. The Commission's engineers submitted an inventory of the proper - ties and a reproduction study, based on pre-war prices. The company presented also a similar study without agreeing that such units were the proper units to apply. The company criticized previous prices used by the Commission's engineers and in some items, we think, sustained its position. On the other hand, the company's inventory was less com - plete than the Commission's inventory and to that extent to its own disadvantage. All wire of the rural lines was omitted from the com - pany's inventory, although the Commission found this wire could have been reproduced at pre-war prices and put in place at an expense of not less than $6,000. The company made no contention whatever relative to reproduction value at the present time. Some indication of such a desire was shown in the pleadings in the application, considered in this case, but no testi - mony was presented in support of it and apparently it was abandoned. We have, therefore, the following summary of factors presented in testimony which may justly be considered in arriving at a fair value of this company's properties: </seg>
            <seg id="p436">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 509 Full Present value value 1. Historical cost (company's exhibit) $30,295 $21,206 (7tt%) To this the Commission has added a study of values, based on its engineers' inventory, and using as a price level figures which would have existed in July, 1920, had the abnormal situation brought about by the world war, not have occurred. To reach such a conclusion, the Com - mission took the average commodity price line from 1900 to 1914 and projected it on the same approximate plane, thereby cutting oft the high peak of the war-time prices. Such a method would increase the figures used by the Commision's engineers from an index figure of approximately one hundred to an index figure of approximately one hundred ten. Such a study would result in the following addition: Full Present value value Trend prices (reproduction as of July, 1920). ...$48,400 $29,040 (60%) Now as to the weight which may be given to the various factors. It seems quite clear that the sacrifice of the investor must play only a minor part, if any,, in reaching conclusions as to fair value. The courts, so far as we know, are unanimous in saying that all the physical property used and useful in the business of a utility must be considered as the company's property in arriving at a fair value and the only question is as to the factors to be used in finding the fair value. There can be- no question from these studies that a considerable amount of the property was built out of surpluses over and above a moderate rate of return, even when allowances are made for donations. In other words, the rates were higher than were necessary when measured by the ordinary con - ception of a fair return. These rates were in existence as far back as 1900. Between 1900 and July ,1907, the state did not regulate the rates of telephone common carriers and a considerable amount of this property was built in that interim. But the Railway Commission Act required that carriers file with the Commission the rates in effect on January l, 1907 and provided in section 15-C that these rates might not thereafter be changed without approval of the Commission. The rates were filed in accordance with that mandate of the legislature and have stood almost without change from that day to this, the Railway Commission not having exercised its power in ex parte investigation to amend the rates and no complaints as to the level of these rates having been made by the public affected. These rates thus recognized are prime facie reasonable. If adjudged unreasonable now, in testing against past experience this Com- Reproduction on pre-war cost basis, (Com- mission's exhibit) 44,002 Reproduction on pre-war cost basis, (company's exhibit) 43,526 Estimated sacrifice of stockholders in cash or its equivalent 25,492 (58%) 30,469 (70;%) 18,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p437">510 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT mission has no power of reparation. Testing the effect of rates in the past is a judicial process ; making rates for the future is legislative. The two processes ordinarily merge in a rate case. In a valuation case, how - ever, the Commission has no power to take part of the property of a utility and restore it to the public or deny its ownership to the utility. In a rate case the Commission can take cognizance of the effect of past rates and whether they have been unusually renumerative. (Lincoln Traction Co. v. City of Lincoln, et al.). The studies by the company, and by the Commission, on the value for reproduction, less depreciation, based on average pre-war cost, are not fully fair to the company. The history of the first twenty years of the century indicates quite clearly that there has been a steady but slow upward trend in price levels. The investments of this company were made with probable full knowledge that if that trend turned downward "without the interposition of unusual factors the loss would fall upon the investors. Likewise, we think consideration should be given to the normal advance in values even though in presenting its case the company prepared no concrete testimony on the subject. As to the objections of the company to the inventories by the Com - mission, we think they may safely be dismissed for the reason that the company's own inventories, based on the same cost method, reaches a slightly less total for original cost than does the Commission's compu - tation. In those places where the Commission has been too low in its figures, the adjustment must have been offset by other places where its estimates were higher than the company's. The company does allege that the condition per cent is considerably better than the judgment of the Commission's engineers. We are inclined to take the judgment of the Commission's engineers as it is based on expert experience, covering a very wide field, and it is supported by the company's own report to the Commission of monies spent in the last decade for current mainten - ance, an abnormally low figure when measured by the experience of like companies. From consideration of all these elements, which may properly be considered factors in arriving at a fair value, due allowance being also made for working capital and for the fact that this is an economically managed going concern in a prosperous country, long since past the un - certain stage of development, we find the fair value to be 330,000. CONSIDERATION OF PRESENT RATE SCHEDULE. In its order to show cause the Commission required the company to defend against a possible readjustment of its rates and a fixing of the rate of return at a lower figure than heretofore paid. The present rates are: </seg>
            <seg id="p438">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 511 93.00 net for individual business service; 2.00 net for party-line business service: 1 50 net for party-line residence and farm service. It is all metallic service. The rates have been, as we have said. In effect constantly since the origin of the company with the exception of the farm line rate which was put into effect when farm line extensions were begun by the present owners in 1905. As we have before stated, there is no question whatever but that these rates were unusually re - munerative. Part of the results accomplished undoubtedly arose from the level of rates at a time when operating expenses were low and another part from the unusual good business management and high economies of the owners, both of whom were proven successful business - men in other lines. In so far as the results were due to unusually good management, no complaint could be made as to results and in accordance with our line of reasoning heretofore the past results are at this time no fair measure of immediate necessities. The property is there. It belongs to the company. It is devoted to public service and cannot be withdrawn so long as a fair return is allowed on a fair value, in 1919 the company paid ten per cent dividends on the outstanding stock and had a surplus remaining of $732.79. This dividend was probably less than proper on a fair value of the property at that time. A scrutiny of the operating expenses indicates that part of what is shown as sur - plus earned should have been credited to accrued depreciation of the plant. Part of the salary of the manager should have been paid from the maintenance account as part of his time was so devoted. In 1920 the company earned $15,232.65, which included an unusual toll earning com - pared with previous years. The operating expenses were $11,603.03; taxes amounted to S549.00; leaving the company with net income avail - able for dividends of $3,080.62. Approximately a proper amount was set aside for maintenance and depreciation. If dividends, not to exceed eight per cent, are allowed on a fair value of the property herein found there would be a surplus margin of $700 earned in 1920. We do not believe the rate readjustment of this company, even under the circumstances, is advisable at this time. We are still in an uncertain stage. The experience of 1921 is problematical. There may be considerable reduction of operating expenses and maybe not. If this investigation had been made when operating costs were normal the reduction in rates would have been warranted. The rate history of the company is so favorable to it that were this an application for an in - crease in rates we do not think the company could have been heard to complain that it was not earning a full measure of a fair return for a temporary future period. We do not, however, consider the spread of rates exactly equitable. Party-line business rate is |2.00. Individual residence rate is $2.00. The company will be required, effective June 1, 1921 ,10 publiÂ«f. a net individual residence rate of $1.75 and to increase </seg>
            <seg id="p439">512 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT the party-line buslnes rate to $2.25 net. This will result in a loss of revenue to the company of about $160. The Commission will also at this time limit the dividends to not more than eight per cent on the fair value found, plus the same rate of dividend on the additional capital added to the property from time to time hereafter. STOCK ADJUSTMENT. In its Application No. 4337, considered jointly in this opinion, the company asks authority to issue $20,000 as a stock dividend and for authority to issue and sell for cash $5,000 additional, to be employed in betterments and replacements of existing properties. No additional issue of stock is essential unless, because of a financing plan, such action is needed to properly protect the property rights of the existing owners in comparison with the stockholder who is about to buy the stock of the company at par. If future stock could be sold at a price above par, fairly reflecting the interest of each present share of stock, and 8UCh price were invested in additions or in improvements, the present stock - holders would be amply protected. It is difficult, however, to sell stock in utilities at a price above par. The application of the company cannot be allowed in its entirety as the Commission's finding of the value of the property is considerably under the sum of the present outstanding stock and the desired stock issue. It is good financing on the part of a utility and conservative safe - guarding Of the interests of the public in the service that some portion of the fair value be represented as surplus in the liabilities statement, and, while it should be allowed to earn a fair return, It should stand as a surplus, uncapitalized, as a stabilizer of credit and as a safeguard against unforeseen disasters or losses to property resulting from extensive re - construction and replacement programs. No particular showing has been made by the company as to what it proposes to do with the stock which it would sell. The record is positive that a rebuilding program is at hand, and necessarily so. This rebuilding program will call for additional capital. A vaguely outlined plan for such additional investment ought not to be made the reason for a stock adjustment, but such stock adjustment in a situation Of this kind is essential if additional stock is to be sold. The company has set up in its petition, considered in this case with the Commission's own in - quiry, that it intends to capitalize $5,000 of additions heretofore made, and release depreciation reserve to that extent for reconstruction pur - poses. We find that this much new capital, at least, is needed now if the company is to continue to give the class of service it has offered in the past.

OPINION AND FINDING 3ROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing on February 22, 1921, at 2 o'clock p. m., on an order to show cause issued by the Commission on February 11, 1921, in the matter of the absorption of loading and unloading charges at the Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha (Ltd.). The Commission had previously authorized the Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha (Ltd.) to amend its tariff to provide for loading and unloading charge of $1.00 in place of fifty cents, provided the carriers for whom said Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha (Ltd.) acted as agent should absorb the charge. Inasmuch as the carriers carry in their tariffs a provision relative to the absorption of the existing charge, it was found necessary to hold a hearing with reference to amendment to their tariffs. Only two of the carriers appeared. It is our understanding that there is no objection on the part of Nebraska carriers to absorb the increased loading and unloading charge. the only point in dispute being the date when such tariff change should take place. The Nebraska carriers have filed tariffs with the Interstate </seg>

The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company and Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company have filed applications for amendment to the tariff, one without designating an effective date and the other for the effective date to be March 16. It seems desirable to handle these under the above docket number on the order to show cause nther than as applications. At the time of the hearing the only objection urged against the ef - fective date being March 1 was the monetary consideration. The question of uniformity was not especially urged, inasmuch as there is no uni - formity among the carriers as to the effective date interstate. The amount involved for a ten-day period on intrastate traffic alone would be but a few hundred dollars. The Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha Â£.td.) filed a showing that the cost to them of doing this work is ninety - ven cents per car. This showing was not challenged by the carriers of record, nor did the carriers urge any reason why they should not absorb the full amount of whatever charge was legally arrived at. It appears proper to the Commission that this change should be made at an early date, in order that the charge for loading and unloading should at least equal the expense involved. The fact that it does not do so in the opinion of the Commission constitutes an emergency.

Appearances: For Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraskaâ W. F. Kirk, superintendent; Yale Holland, attorney; For Village of Manley â W. J. Rau, W. H. Frost, D. E. Brann For Village of Panama â E. Field ; For Village of Wabash â J. C. Brown, Geo. A. Towle ; For The Western Union Telegraph Co. â W. T. Davis, Supt. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: In February and March various informal complaints were filed with the Commission alleging that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska had removed telegraph instruments from certain stations, thereby seriously interfering with the service to the public. Because of these informal complaints the Commission issued a resolution in the form Of an order to show cause, directed at The Western Union Telegraph Company and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, re - turnable March 15, 1921. Defendant companies were required to show cause why they should not be ordered to restore telegraph service. Stated briefly the contention advanced by the Missopri Pacific was as follows: LThat for the operation of railroad trains it was not necessary to eive or send messages from any of the three complaining towns; that as far as the railroad relation with the public was concerned it re - lated almost exclusively to the supply of cars for shippers, which service to the public the railroad company alleged it was able to take care of by letters carried to Weeping Water, Elmwood or Douglas, as the case might be, for transmittal by wire to Falls City; that the removal of tele - graph instruments in these various stations was solely for purposes of economy in that wages paid to a station agent who used the telegraph instruments was $145.55 and the same man by not using the telegraph instruments was paid $112.60 under the schedule; that the railroad com - pany was powerless to revise the wages as fixed by the war labor board; and that only by such means as this, not seriously affecting the public, could the defendant railroad company hope to earn its operating expenses and fixed charges. On behalf of The Western Union Telegraph Company it was urged: That it operates in a very large portion of the towns of Nebreska in conjunction with the various railroad companies, without which rela - tionship it would be unable to serve most of the towns which are now </seg>
            <seg id="p446">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 519 served commercially by telegraph; that it has a contract with the Mis - souri Pacific Railroad company under which the railroad company for certain compensatory factors agrees to handle commercial messages wherever it maintains a telegraph agent; that this contract does not permit the Western Union to require the railroad company to maintain commercial telegraph service for it; that the commercial business at both Manley and Wabash is very light, the total gross receipts at Manley for 1920 being $26.52 and at Wabash $26.57; and that it is perfectly willing to continue to serve the people of these various towns with commercial telegraph service under the arrangements previ - ously existing but that it cannot as an alternative to using the railroad agent maintain an agency of its own with an independent operator, the cost being prohibitive. On behalf of respondents it was urged That a potential hardship exists in the lack of telegraph service; that Manley and Wabash are served by party line telephones from Weeping Water and Elmwood, respectively, and that telegraph messages must under this arrangement be telephoned to these two towns for transmittal, thereby making them more or less public by reason of listening in on party lines; that quite probably messages relating to the sale of grain would be seriously delayed by reason of lack of telegraph service; that they were very much afraid that car orders would also be delayed: and that anyway it was a service they had enjoyed for a quarter of u century and regardless of cost it should be continued either under the arrangement previously existing or by the Western Union putting in special operators to handle the service. From Panama it was contended chiefly that lack of telegraph service interfered with receiving bids on grain and accepting such bids within reasonable time limits. At the conclusion of the hearing the Commission held the case open in order that the complaining towns might file specific instances of dis - advantages resulting from lack of telegraph service under the experience These specific instances have not been filed. It is realized by the Com mission that occasion will arise when lack of telegraph commercia service will be a very serious disadvantage to the citizens of that town but this potential situation can hardly be a sufficient reason for asking the public utility to continue to give such service at a cost of not les than S4HO a year at each of the towns when the gross receipts from th service of those towns are less than one-tenth of that. Such a position could hardly be sustained even though the two utilities involved wer financially prosperous as a whole, but under the circumstances now existing, when both utilities have a considerable financial burden, the contention is not tenable at all. The Commission has arranged for better telephone toll service at </seg>

There appears to be no reason why telegraph service should be restored under all these cir - cumstances until such time as the extra cost to the railroad company will be not more than nominal. Whether such a condition will arise will depend upon the development of the national wages conferences between railroad brotherhoods and railroad executives with the govern- tThe objections of the village of Panama were not rascataed on cros^ mination as it was quite evident that the grain dealers at that point r on telephone service almost exclusively.

(SEAL I RESOLUTION NO. 62 In re Investigation of Alleged Violations of the Nebraska Statutes by the Glenwood Telephone Company. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: Effective January 1, 1918, the Glenwood Telephone Company was authorized to publish and collect a certain schedule of rates for each of its twelve exchanges. Among these was Guide Rock, for which ex - change a rate of $1.50 per month for individual business and $1.00 per month for residence and farm lines was approved. Subsequently the Commission was advised that the Guide Rock exchange had not com - plied with the order and it was ordered to show cause why it should not be prosecuted under section 232, chapter 67, of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913. Later the Commission learned that this exchange had commenced to comply with the order and the citation to appear and show cause was indefinitely postponed. It was found upon investiga - tion, however, that reasons existed for making further inquiry into the practices of that exchange and the company was required to appear on December 6, 1921, which it did. The Glenwood Telephone Company is a loosely organized and more loosely conducted corporation, consisting of twelve distinct districts. Each district constitutes an individual unit in the system and is sepa - rately managed as to revenues and expenses. The central officers main - tain only a supervisory control over the districts. It was disclosed at the hearing that the Guide Rock exchange, which consists of only about sixty subscribers, became heavily involved in debt and at a stockholders </seg>
            <seg id="p451">524 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT meeting, held in October, 1920, it was decided to increase the rate or "assessment"' from $10.00 per year to $18.00 per year. The rate of $18.00 per year was charged until the next stockholders meeting in October, 1921, at which time it was reduced to $15.00. It is stated very frankly by the secretary of the Guide Rock district that the action of the stock - holders in changing the rates was taken without any knowledge of the statute requiring approval by this Commission before such changes could be effected. It was also stated that these readjustments were made without informing the central officers of the company. It developed at the hearing likewise that. so far as the secretary at Guide Rock knew no notice had been given them by the officers of the company of the approval of rates by the Commission in 191S. It is manifest, therefore, that the relationship between the central headquarters and the various districts is more or less casual and without particular authority. It is admitted that this is particularly true with reference to the Gaide Rock district because of its location at a considerable distance from head - quarters at Blue Hill. The president and treasurer of the central corporation gave their pledge that hereafter more care will be given to the filing of raiCH of the various districts and assurance was also given by the secretary of the Guide Rock district that no rates would be changed in the future without the necessary authority. It was suggested that the central offi - cers immediately notify all of the district officers that hereafter any changes in rates, rules or regulations desired by any district must first be reported to and have the approval of the central organization, the central officers in turn to make the application to the Commission lor the necessary authority. The officers of the company promise to see that this policy is immediately carried into effect and hereafter main tained. While there appears to be no good reason why the officers of the district at Guide Rock should not have had information concerning the order of the Commission in 191S, it was doubtless due to the loose meth - ods attending the operation of the exchange at that point. There is no evidence of intent to violate the law. It would appear, therefore, that prosecution at this time would serve no good purpose. We are of the opinion, however, that the company should be required by order to issue a notice to all districts as above described. We are also of the opinion that the present rate of S15.00 per year for all classes of service is reasonable under the circumstances and should be validated. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Glenwood Telephone Com - pany be and the same hereby is directed and instructed to notify the proper officers of each of the districts within its system that hereafter any changes in rates, rules or regulations made by any district must </seg>

OPINION AND FINDIXC COOK, Commissioner The petitioner, the Chicago. Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Com - pany, by order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission a number of years ago, was required to install depot facilities on its right-of-way at University Place. After constructing a depot and sidetrack and installing an agent the records show that the business which developed was not sufficient to jusitify maintaining the depot at this point on carrier's right-of-way. Later an order was issued by the Nebraska State Railway Commission closing the depot. The order was conditioned in that the depot and sidetrack should remain in the same condition as at the time of closing same. Some time during the year 1921 the superintendent of said company removed the said sidetrack without the consent of the Railway Commission, at which time the Commission ordered the railway company to show cause why the removal was made. At a hearing before the Commission on the 16th of December. 1921. the company was represented by its officers and attorney; the city of University Place was represented by its mayor and a number of its leading citizens. The company stated that it was willing to reinstate the sidetrack and place it in the same condition it was prior to the </seg>

BROWNE, Commissioner: Orders in this matter establishing rates for common carriers by trucks on the highways in eastern Nebraska were entered May 21, 1919, </seg>
            <seg id="p456">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 529 July 5. 1919, and November 22, 1919. Briefly, this action by the Com - mision came about under these conditions: At the close of the world war the steam transportation companies of the nation were unable to handle the vast flood of traffic being offered by the country. The need for supplemental service was acute. The Council of National Defense was instrumental in the establishment in Omaha of the Douglas County Highways Transport Commission, with the Omaha Chamber of Commerce taking an active part in its work. These bodies petitioned the State Railway Commission to exercise the power undoubtedly conferred upon it by law to establish scientific rates for trucking service, chiefly for the purpose of developing that immediate branch of the transportation business which petitioners felt was not being adequately encouraged. The Commission set the matter down for hearing and gave very careful attention, in the light of the information available, to the question of costs of transporting freight by highways vehicles and on May 21, 1919, entered its first order which set forth the results of its investigations, prescribing a classification of freight, which to that time was wholly lacking, and set out a scale of rates which was to lie charged, effective July 1, 1919, in the eastern half of the .state. Xo effort to go into the remainder of the state with this regulation was made because the business in the western part of the ute Intel not developed. Soon after rates became effective an additional hearing was held to develop some difficulties that had already arisen and certain small changes were made in the original order, particularly with reference to transportation from one consignor to one consignee with an empty one - way trii&gt;. In September additional hearings were held and the order was again amended, effective December 8, 1919, to take in Buffalo county because of the business originating in Kearney, to simplify the classifica - tion in order to make it available for the rank and file of one vehicle truckers and to make additional changes not here necessary to set forth. In issuing these orders the Commission well knew the handicaps under which it was working. Experience tables in the operation of such enterprises were largely lacking and the costs of trucking were in nowise as well known as the costs of hauling by steam transport on artificial roadway. The order was mandatory and applied to all who held themselves out to carry business intertown for any who might come and ask. It was, however, not policed by the Commission with any vigor for two reasons: (1) It was known that these emergency orders must be more or less educational in their nature unless the state were to penalize mere ignorance of the law. (2) The Commission had no ade - quate revenues with which to enforce its orders with proper field mach - inery- It was known, too, that additional studies on costs would have to be made and the effort to secure this experience was made a consid - erable portion of the original order. Companies were required to keep </seg>
            <seg id="p457">530 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL. REPORT careful books in an approved manner and to make regular reports to the Commission, which, in return, would undertake to compile these reports and to have available records of costs which would be highly essential in the future regulation of the industry, both in the interests of those who engaged in the work and those who hired such transport. After observing the working of the order for a year, the Commission was not at all certain that it had been an advisable effort. Under date of March 22, 1920, a resolution was adopted, calling on those engaged in the trucking business and those who did business with such transport companies as so desired, to appear at the offices of the Commission and show cause, if there were any cause, why the existing orders should not be repealed and the business be restored to the wholly competitive basis of private enterprise. Hearing was held on April 7, 1920, and was attended by representa - tives of numerous trucking concerns and by certain representatives of tire and truck manufacturers. The public itself was not represented save by the Commission. On the whole the testimony was strongly in favor of continuation of regulation. It was argued that men would not risk their capital on a purely competitive basis in the face of well-known facts and that a large number of those who did enter the business failed because of inadequate protection against accruing depreciation. It was admitted that only a small percentage of those engaged in the business in the state were observing the order of the Commission regarding the classification and rates and that practically none of them, including those strongly favorable to regulation, were carrying out the Commission's instructions regarding cost accounting. At the close of the hearing the Commission was still in doubt as to the wisdom of continuing the rates, but it took no action on its proposal to repeal its orders and decided rather to continue observation of the effect of the orders. The Commission is at this time convinced that trucking for hire in more than local service will succeed only when proper attention is paid to the costs of operating trucks and to the promotion of short haul, quick traffic, with return loads properly developed. It is true that rea - sonable success may be attained by those who offer service to any and all comers, with the option to receive or reject the business and the further option of taking into account the full measure of road conditions. The business must also take into proper account the number of days in the year when it is impossible to operate trucks intertown on dirt roads, and that the earning power of the trucking company is thereby cor - respondingly reduced. Even under the rates proposed by the Commission, based as they were on the best information attainable, only a few concerns in this </seg>
            <seg id="p458">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSIOX 531 state have found it profitable to attempt to operate intertown on regular schedules. There has been no proper appreciation on the part of those engaged in the business of the need for regulation and we think, in the light of the observations made, that most small concerns in this busi - ness prefer to take their chances in purely competitive field than to ac - cept scientifically prepared cost studies. It is not a case of compelling adherence to the fixed schedules in the interest of the public, but of doing that which is of most benefit to all concerned in the development of an important industry, but neither public nor those in the business appear to be as interested as the state itself in the successful develop - ment of the business. It does not appear advisable without proof of extortion for the state to pioneer further. When hard surfaced roads have been constructed and trucking transportation can be had a definite number of days in a year, costs of the business may be ascertained ac - curately enough upon which to project a rate basis. It is difficult to comprehend how the public at this time will be Uisadvantaged by the elimination of the existing trucking orders. Com - petition has free play, quite distinctively different than is true of most common carrier service. The time might soon arrive when the business intertown will be concentrated into the hands of a few concerns and it is possible under these circumstances for combinations and agreements to be made which would be seriously disadvantageous to the public, but that time is not here now. The lack of regulation has its chief menace for those who are putting their money into the business. But in the length of time the Commission has attempted to stabilize the business, not only in the interests of those who risk their capital but in the devel - opment of ah important arm of transportation service, there has been such a lack of co-operation on the part of these concerns as to warrant giving no further consideration to that phase of the matter. We will, therefore, cancel and annul all existing orders containing rules, regulations, classifications and rates for the transport of freight and express by highway truck in Nebraska. This will be without pre - judice to again opening the matter when need shall arise. The Com - mission still has a considerable number of copies of the classification and rate basis which will be available gratis to any who desire the benefit of the studies made to the end that financially ruinous practices may be avoided. , ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that its orders entered in General Order No. 46, regarding the transportation of freight by vehicles, using public highways in eastern Nebraska, and dated May 21, 1919, July 5, 1919, and November 22, 1919. be and they hereby are rescinded and annulled, effective at once. </seg>

Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) GENERAL ORDER NO. 48 In the Matter of Stopping in Transit to Load Horses and Mules. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: The session of the Nebraska legislature of 1919 passed Senate File No. 177, which required carriers operating railroads in the state of N'e - jraska to publish in their tariffs provision for stopping in transit once to complete loading of horses and mules and provided a charge of $5.00 or such privilege over and above the regular rates for the particular ransportation involved. It also provided a penalty for failuiv to so pub - is h the provision in the tariffs and required the State Railway Com - mission to enforce the provisions of the act. Commission and the attorney general of tin state are without power compel obedience. The latter part of the year 1920. and subsequent to the retn carriers' property to their owners, the Commission notified the v; railroads operating in Nebraska to comply with the provisions o statute. The carriers called attention, in reply, to the provision I transportation act of 1920, section 20Sa. which reads: van "All rates, fares, and charges, and all classifications, regula - tions and practices, in any wise changing, affecting, or determining, any part of the aggregate of rates, fares, or charges, or the value of the service rendered, which on February 29. 1920, are in effect on the lines of carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, shall continue in force and effect until thereafter changed by state or federal authority, respectively, or pursuant to authority of law." Their interpretation of this provision of the law was that the Ne - braska law referred to was never operative and could not become opera - tive until action within the state by the legislature or by the Railway Commission subsequent to February 29, 1920. They agreed, however, This act went into effect in July. 1919. This was (luring the penoi )f government control and on instructions from the division of law to! he United States administration at Washington, D. C\. carriers refuset ;o obey the order. Because of such condition of government control th&lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p460">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 533 that if the Commission would issue an order embodying the terms of the law so as to protect their interpretation of the federal statute they would at once obey the order and publish the transit provision in the tariffs. The Commission was unable to agree with this suggestion because in other litigation involving the interpretation of the federal transporta - tion act of 1920 it had taken a very different view of the meaning of sniion ii.iSa, above quoted. To obviate the difficulty and to preserve any rights which might exist both of carriers and of the Commission, a stipulation was agreed to among the carriers affected and filed with the Commission under date of February 3, 1921, to the effect that the car - riers "will not consider such act either a confession or admission, nor &gt;lding in their favor, nor on their part will it be either referred to r offered in evidence in any hearing or litigation involving either intra r interstate rates." This quotation referred to the suggestion that the Commission issue an order embodying the terms of Senate File No. 177. It appears to the Commission that this stipulation solves the diffi - Â«ulty in which the carriers and the Commission found themselves placed ii consideration of this matter and enables the Commission to issue an rder without hearing, directing the publication of the stopping in tran- sit privilege on movement of horses and mules within the state of Nebraska.

            <seg id="p461">534 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT i GENERAL ORDER NO. 48 In the Matter of Proposed Amendments to Nebraska Classification No. I. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The above matter came on for consideration upon complaint filed with the Commission petitioning for an amendment to Nebraska Classi- The complainant requests that the following paragraphs of Nebraska Classification No. I be cancelled. Paragraph (B), Section 8, Rule 14-B, page S, reading as follows "Boxes must also bear name- and address of the shipper and description of contents." and Paragraph (B), Section 4. Rule 14-C. page 12, reading as follows: "Drums and pails must also bear name and address of the shipper and description of contents." Complainant states that a corresponding clause in the Western Classification was eliminated a few years ago and that the present clause in the Nebraska Classification has caused a great deal of confusion when making intrastate and interstate shipments. Complainant further states that, in the event of failure to mark intrastate shipment as required by the above rules, the charges assessed are on a much higher basis. After an investigation the Commission finds that the request is rea - sonable and warranted by existing conditions, and in view of the fact that both the shippers and carriers are agreed, same will be authorized without the necessity of a formal hearing. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that Paragraph (B) of Section S, Rule 14-B, page 8 and para - graph (B) of Section 4, Rule 14-C, page 12, Nebraska Classification No. I be and the same are hereby cancelled.

            <seg id="p468">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 541 RATE DEPARTMENT ACTIVITIES To the Commission: The rate department has two major functions â to keep a file of tariffs showing the freight and passenger rates and charges lawfully in effect in Nebraska, and to assist Nebraska shippers and the Commission in their efforts to see that rates are both reasonable and non-discrimina - tory. Although the carriers, under the direction of the Interstate Com - merce Commission and state commissions, have been making an effort to simplify tariffs and rate schedules, the fact Is that, because of ex - traordinary conditions existing during and following the war period, the tariffs now in effect are in many cases more complicated than ever be - fore. This tariff condition causes many controversies between shippers and carriers as to whether the charges paid were, in fact, excessive or In accordance with the tariff. Letters complaining as to rates and tariff rules in effect are recorded as informal complaints and referred to this department, which makes an effort to secure an adjustment of the matter which will be satisfactory to the shipper and permit him to do business and at the same time do the carrier involved no injustice. A large number of such cases are being handled, and the writer feels that the results are in most cases satisfactory to our shippers. We also prepare a considerable volume of exhibits and furnish testi - mony to be presented in cases before the Interstate Commerce Com - mission, which have, in many instances, involved rates between Ne - braska points and destinations either within or outside the state. Among important cases of this character, we call attention to the livestock caso involving rates from Nebraska to all Missouri river livestock markets, for which considerable preparatory work was done during the year past. The hearing in that case, which will determine whether Nebraska ship - pers shall receive reductions amounting to several hundred thousand dollars a year, or pay increases amounting to a still larger sum, will be held by the Interstate Commerce Commission early in 1922. Another case of a similar nature, involving all rates on cement from other states to Nebraska and between Nebraska points, was the subject matter of an Interstate Commerce Commission hearing, in the course of which we presented considerable testimony indicating that existing Nebraska rates on cement are too high and should be substantially reduced, to place our state upon the same level as adjacent states which now have lower rates. Generally, wherever Nebraska state and interstate rates have been involved in cases before the Interstate Commerce Commission, we have tried to secure a favorable adjustment for Nebraska, which will give us </seg>
            <seg id="p469">542 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT fair treatment as compared with adjoining states served largely by the same lines of railroad. L Jointly with other western state railroad commissions, we intro - &gt;d exhibits and generally participated in an Interstate Commerce Commission investigation, as a result of which rates on grain were re - duced, and coarse grains were given a differential under wheat, on about the same basis as that existing before the war. It seems unnecessary to say that this department hopes to give an increasing number of Nebraska shippers practical demonstrations of what it can do to solve their transportation problems, under the direction of the Commission.

            <seg id="p536">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 609 PART VII. COURT DECISIONS IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA, Lewis H. Biackiedge, et ai., Plaintiffs, v. Farmers Independent Telephone Company, et al., Defendants. No. 21176. Opinion entered February 23, 1921. 1. The statute, requiring physical connections to be made between telephone companies (Rev. St. 1913, sees. 7414, 7417), applies to companies operating "trunk and toll" lines, and contemplates only the forwarding of messages when such lines are used. 2. The Railway Commission is, by the constitution, given plenary power to regulate and control telephone companies which are operated as public utilities, but such powers are subject to the general constitutional limitations and subject to whatever specific legislation is enacted pro - viding the manner and limit and extent that the power shall be exer - cised. 3. Though at common law such public utilities could not be required to make physical connections of their telephone systems, the legislature or the Railway Commission may order such connections When public convenience and necessity require, provided tha't the company required to render the service will receive proper compensation for the additional service which it renders, and that such conditions are imposed as will protect such company in its individual management and control of its own property, and that the order does not so operate as to create or allow of such discriminatory conditions as will cause injury to the com - pany concerned. 4. Where the Railway Commission, as a condition of an order re - quiring the physical connection of two companies, directs that the two companies shall divide all new business, in such proportions that the relation in size of the one company to the other shall not change but shall be continuously maintained so long as the order of exchange of service shall operate, the right of either company to accept as sub - scribers all who shall apply in the territory covered by their system is denied, and the effect of such order is to take the company's property without due process of law. 5. A regulation requiring the exchange of service between telephone companies is legislative in character and cannot be modified, but must be either approved or set aside by the courts, except, however, such por- </seg>
            <seg id="p537">610 tions as are distinctly separable may be sustained or annulled as separate and independent regulations. FLANSBURG, J. Appeal from an order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, re - quiring physical connection between telephone companies for the ex - change of local service, as well as for the transmission of long-distance messages. The Farmers Independent Telephone Company and the Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph Company, both Nebraska corporations, are engaged in the telephone business at Red Cloud, Nebraska. Bach operates a local exchange, and in that business they are direct competitors. The farmers company has, also, farm lines extending into the country, and has switch - ing exchanges with certain other independent companies which operate small telephone exchanges in neighboring towns. The Lincoln company has an extended business over the entire state and operates long-distance lines in connection with and as a part of the Bell system throughout the United States and Canada. For some years prior to October 1, 1917, a physical connection had been maintained between the exchanges of the two companies at Red Cloud, and the subscribers of the Farmers company had been given the privilege of directly transmitting telephone messages over the Lincoln company's long-distance lines. By reason of the duplication of tele - phones, found necessary by many subscribers, and the other incon - venience incident to the division of the local business at Red Cloud be - tween the two companies, a movement began among certain telephone users for the elimination of one or the other of these companies from the field. Meetings were held and an agreement reached by a number of citizens, to the effect that they would patronize the Farmers company exclusively. As a result 84 of the Lincoln subscribers immediately trans - ferred to the Farmers company. The Lincoln company, in the protec - tion of its own interests, promptly discontinued the long-distance service formerly rendered the subscribers of the Farmers company. The Farmers company then made application to the Railway Commission for an order requiring the re-establishment of the long-distance service. In that pro - ceeding the two complainants, who are citizens of Red Cloud, and tele - phone users, intervened; the one praying for an order to require the two companies to mutually exchange all telephone service, local as well as long-distance, and the other that the two companies be required to consolidate their telephone systems in Red Cloud. The Railway Com - mission, after a hearing, entered an order requiring the Lincoln com - pany to furnish long-distance service to subscribers of the Farmers com - pany and to re-establish physical connection between the two plants for that purpose. It also ordered that the two companies make necessary physical connection, and that each be required to receive and transmit </seg>
            <seg id="p538">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 611 ail local calls, originating on the lines of the other, where destined to a subscriber on its own local lines. As compensation (or the exchange of local service, the rates to all local subscribers of each of the companies were increased. All business subscribers were increased 75 cents a month, residence subscribers 20 cents a month, and farm and switching subscribers 10 cents a month. The Railway Commission then made a specific finding, to the effect that the above orders, if granted without other conditions, would work injuriously to the Lincoln company and would result in a practical confiscation of its properties at Red Cloud, since all of its subscribers would eventually, under the circumstances created, transfer to the Farmers' lines. It was therefore further ordered, avowedly as a protection to the interests of the Lincoln company, that the future local telephone business should be divided, and that neither company should accept new or additional local subscribers in numbers sufficient to change the proportion in size that one company bore to the other on October 1, 1917. The Farmers company appeals, complaining of all those provisions, except the order covering the long-distance service. It is insisted that the statute, Laws 1913, ch. 79 (Rev. St. 1913, sees. 7414, 7417), requires only connections with trunk and toll lines, and not a general exchange of local business. The title and body of the act, we think, confirm this contention. The title of the act refers only to "trunk and toll" lines, and the body of the act also refers specifically to such lines and provides for the division of tolls for long-distance service only. It is also provided that the tolls for the transmission of each particular message shall be divided, in part, upon the basis of the number of miles of line furnished by the respective companies. We find nothing in the act, however, which attempts to limit the general power of the Railway Commission over telephone companies insofar us its action may go beyond and not be in conflict with the mandatory provisions of this act. By the Constitution (Article V, Sec. 19a) the Railway Commission is given general power to regulate and control such companies according to its own judgment and discretion, subject to the general constitutional limitations, and except insofar as the legislature shall, by specific legis - lation, provide how, and limit to what extent, that power shall be exer - cised. The Railway Commission has, then, full and plenary power, legisla - tive in character, to control those companies, and to pass reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct of their business. It is authorized, in that regard, to exercise the police power of the state and that power of regulation and control which is impliedly reserved by the state in the grant of charters to such public utilities. It is the contention of the Farmers company that a physical connec - tion can be required between telephone companies only through a legis- </seg>
            <seg id="p539">612 lative enactment or by virtue of contract, and that the order of the Rail - way Commission goes beyond the provisions of the statute, above men - tioned. It is true that, by the common law, public utilities owed no duty beyond their existing lines, and, therefore, no obligation to make physical connections or exchange service with each other. Each had the right to operate independently. Where the common law is not changed by legislation, a court would, therefore, find no authority upon which to base an order for such physical connections or exchange of serv - ice.

The Railway Commission is, by the constitution, delegated authority which is, in its nature, legislative, and the common law is not a limita - tion upon that power. Its orders, as well as the statutory enactments of the legislature, must meet constitutional requirements, and must not be oppressive nor arbitrary, nor disregard substantial property rights. The question arises whether or not the order of the Railway Com - mission in this case, based in part upon the statute mentioned, and in part a direct exercise of its own power, can be justified as a reasonable regulation of the business and service of these companies, or does it offend against those constitutional inhibitions, prohibiting the taking of property without due process of law, or without just compensation. Although it has been held (Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Eshleman, supra) that, to require physical connection between different telephone systems and to compel one company to furnish the service of its lines to the patrons of the other company, cannot, under any condi - tions, be justified as a regulation, but must be considered a taking of property, and that it can only be accomplished through the exercise of the power of eminent domain, it is now quite universally recognized that the state, or its delegated authorities, may, in the exercise of its police power or its power to regulate public service corporations, compel such physical connections and compel the one company to furnish its wires for the transmission of messages originating on the other company's lines, provided that an arrangement is made so that the company required to render the service will receive proper compensation for the additional service which it renders, and that such conditions are imposed as will protect such company in its individual management and control of its own property, and that the order does not so operate as to create or allow of such discriminatory conditions as will cause injury to the com - pany concerned.

App.) 308; City of Milbank v. Dakota Central Telephone Co., 37 S. Dak. 504. Whether the regulation is made by the order of the Railway Commis - sion, or by legislative enactment, it can, in either event, be upheld only after providing an equitable adjustment of the rights involved. The principle of requiring such physical connection of lines in fur - therance of public service and for the public convenience was first recognized as applied to railroads. Michigan Central R. Co. v. Michigan Kailroad Commission, 236 U. S. 615; Wisconsin, N. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Jacob - son, 179 U. S. 287; State of Washington v. Falrchild, 224 U. S. 510. When a telephone company procures a connection, so as to be al - lowed the use of long-distance wires of another, or where two companies are required to connect their long-distance toll lines, the toll charges, being based on distance of transmission of messages, may be so appor - tioned that each company will get compensation for just such part of the services that it renders in the transmission of each individual message. To that extent there is a clear analogy in principle to the rule as applied to railroad companies, where the transportation charges are automatically apportioned between the two companies, one company receiving compen - sation for that part of the service rendered up to, and the other beyond, the connecting point. Where two telephone companies are competing for local business and one of them has long-distance lines which it has been compelled, by a regulatory order, to furnish to the patrons of the other company, it has, in some instances, been found necessary, in order to maintain an equality between the companies and to insure a proper compensation to the company furnishing additional service, to provide a switching charge against patrons of the other company, to be collected in addition to the regular toll rates charged to the subscribers of the company having the long-distance lines. Wisconsin Telephone Co. v. Railroad Commission, supra; Southwestern Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co. v. State, supra; Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Wright-Dickinson Hotel Co., supra. The order of the Railway Commission, in the case here before us, re - quires an exchange of all local service, and provides a flat rate, instead of an individual switching charge, as compensation for the additional service to be rendered by the respective companies. The local service of these companies as to their own subscribers is also not based upon toll rates, but on a flat rate per month, so that there is not the same </seg>
            <seg id="p541">614 opportunity (or apportioning the compensation between the companies for the transmission of a message from the lines of one over the lines of the other as there is where the two companies are operating their lines on toll charges. No complaint is made that a flat rate cannot be justi - lied in place of a toll rate, and we do not now see any reason why a flat rate would prevent a possibility of proper apportionment of compensa - tion between the companies, where the service, upon which the flat rate is to be based, is of such a uniform character that such a rate would work reasonably and equitably as to all concerned, and would result in I discrimination. The order under consideration gives to each of the npanies, alike, an increase of 75 cents for business phones, 20 cents for idence phones, and 10 cents for farm phones, but the telephone rates of these two companies, to which these increases are to be added, are not the same. The Lincoln company's rates are from $2.00 to $2.50 a month for business service, and from $1 to $1.50 for residence service, while the Farmers company's rates are $1.50 for business service and $1 for resi - dence service. By the order entered, there is an effectual consolidation of the service of these two companies by which a subscriber of the one company appears to receive practically the same service as a subscriber of the other company. The rates to the subscribers of the Farmers com - pany are, however, under this arrangement, considerably lower. Fur - thermore, it would appear that the use of the Lincoln company's higher rate lines would be more valuable than the use of the Farmers' lines. tis the service of these lines that the two companies are required to :hange, and yet the one company receives no more for the service in the other. The matter of the fixation and adjustment of the conditions and of rates, where an exchange of service is ordered, is one exclusively for the Railway Commission, and not for the courts. The one function of the court is to determine whether such an order as has been made can be legally justified. The Commission has apparently not attempted to work out a system of rates and charges which would work as an equitable foundation for an exchange of service, and this may have been for the reason that it considered such could not be done. However, that may be, the findings of the Commission show that the Lincoln company has sus - tained a considerable loss of patronage by reason of the Farmers com - pany's competition, which has the advantage of local ownership; and the Commission further finds that the requirement for an exchange of local and long-distance service, as covered by those portions of the order that we have just discussed, will in practical effect work a confiscation of the Lincoln company's property through the process of a complete loss of its local subscribers to the other company, unless some provision is made in the order which will afford protection. Such an order, to be sus - tained, must be one that will operate reasonably, and not be arbitrary, nor violate constitutional inhibitions. Unless a reasonable adjustment can be made where the Lincoln company can be protected against such </seg>
            <seg id="p542">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 615 a detriment and substantial loss as the Railway Commission's findings shows that it will otherwise suffer, it seems clear to us that this com - pany cannot legally be forced to furnish either long-distance or local service to the patrons of its competitor. Pioneer Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. State, 177 Pac. (Okla.) 580, supra. For, as said in the case just cited: "A connection, under rules and regulations that amount to the destruction of property, or that works a discrimination against the sub - scribers of either exchange, would amount to the taking of property with - out due process of law. The state, of course, has the power to take private property for public use under its rights of eminent domain; but this can only be done for a fair consideration. The section of the constitution contemplates the physical connection and the regulation of such union under the police powers of the state." The order of the Railway Commission contains a provision calculated to protect the Lincoln company; it is that all new business shall be divided in such proportions between the companies that the relation in size of the one company to the other shall not change but shall be con - tinuously maintained throughout all future growth, or so long as the order for exchange of service shall operate. Serious inconvenience is a necessary result of having two local tele - phone companies in operation side by side, and, though such duplication cannot be justified from an economic standpoint, it must be remembered that these companies each received a franchise to operate in the same locality and that they have built plants and extended their lines through - out the territory granted. Their expenditures and investments have been based upon the public grant and their rights have become vested. It must be remembered also that these companies owe a duty to the public. They not only have the right to seek subscribers in the territory where they are operating, but all persons wishing to become subscribers have the reciprocal right to demand that they shall become such subscribers and that the service of that public utility which they choose shall be rendered to them. To grant to such a company the right to construct a telephone line, and then later to deny it the right to have all persons along that line connect with it as subscribers. Is to take away the very grant that has been given. It is to deny the company the very use of the property for which the property was especially constructed. Statutes have been passed in some states providing that a public utility shall not extend its lines into new territory unless it shall have procured a cer - tificate from a regulatory commission, showing that the territory is not already adequately served and that public necessity and convenience re - quire additional service. The order here cannot be justified on the prin - ciples underlying those regulations. Those regulations, when within rea - sonable limits, do not affect vested rights, but deal only with an exten - sion of grants to such companies into territory not theretofore served by them. We do not hesitate to say that the order of the Railway Commis- </seg>
            <seg id="p543">616 aion, requiring the division of new business, cannot be legally justified, and is the taking of property rights without due process of law. The provision as to the division of such new business is so correlated and interdependent with the other provisions of the order that it cannot le separated from them. The order of the Railway Commission in this ase is an entirety. It cannot be divided into separate and independent rders. It is, furthermore, a regulation, legislative in character, and annot be modified or changed by this court. The order, as found, must, o far as the power of this court goes, be either approved or set aside. maha &amp; C. B. Street R. Co. v.

Reversed. (See Part III., Page 111.) IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA rs of Nebraska, Appellant, v. Southern Elkhorn Telephone Company, Appellee. No. 21387. Opinion entered June 23, 1921. 1. Where several farmers in co-operation constructed a rural tele - tone line, so as to connect their farms with a public service telephone ompany in town, from whom they purchased telephone boxes and rented ransmitters, and were afforded switching service to local and long-dis - tance subscribers over the lines of such telephone company, and paid to ie telephone company the same rates as regular subscribers, but did ot exact nor receive compensation for messages transmitted over their ural line, and raised no revenue except such sums by mutual assess - ment as were needed to maintain and keep in repair their properties, eld, that they were not operating as a common carrier, denned by our tatute (Rev. St. 1913, sec. 6124) as "telephone companies * â¢ Â« engaged n the transmission of messages * * * for hire," and were not under the upervision of the Nebraska State Railway Commission. 2. Though section 7418, Rev. St. 1913, grants a right of way over the public roads of the state to "any telegraph or telephone company incorporated or doing business in this state," it does not follow that </seg>
            <seg id="p544">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 617 anyone who erects poles and strings telephone wires upon a public road is a telephone company or a common carrier. 3. Though such a rural telephone line may render impracticable the extension of further telephone service in that particular locality, and hence be a matter of public concern, the fact that the situation is of public interest does not alone characterize the rural line as a public service company, nor identify it as a common carrier. Its character is to be determined rather by the purpose for which the property is in - tended to be used and the actual use to which it ia devoted. Heard before Morrissey, C. Rose, JJ. j. Aldrich, Flansburg, Letton and FLANSBURG, J. This was an action by the state of Nebraska, brought against a num - ber of farmers, who had constructed a rural telephone line and who called themselves the Southern Elkhorn Telephone company, and was to compel them to obey an order of the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission, commanding them to furnish to one Doxstader, a farmer living in the vicinity, a connection with their telephone line. The trial court found in favor of the defendant and entered a dismissal, from which order the state appeals. The sole question for determination is whether or not the so-called Southern Elkhorn Telephone company is a common carrier and there - fore under the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission. If found to be such a common carrier, then the order of the Railway Commission, requiring it to extend its service to the farmer Doxstader, must be enforced; otherwise, the order of the Commission is without legal authority. In 1917 the farmers mentioned, living in the vicinity of Norfolk, bad requested telephone service from the Nebraska Telephone company, which company was a public service corporation doing a telephone busi - ness at Norfolk and throughout the state. This the telephone company, in the first instance, refused to give, but the negotiations resulted in an agreement, in pursuance of which the farmers constructed at their own expense a telephone line from Norfolk to their farms, and purchased telephone boxes and rented transmitters from the telephone company, and were thereupon received by the telephone company as subscribers upon the same terms as the subscribers in Norfolk. Each one of the farmers contributed toward the expenses of constructing this party line. The telephone poles were placed, some in the highway, some along the property lines and used as fence posts, and some across private property. The farmers never incorporated or associated themselves as a company. They, however, adopted the name of Southern Elkhorn Tele - phone company for the purpose of convenience in their dealings as a collective body with the Nebraska Telephone company. They kept their </seg>
            <seg id="p545">618 lines in repair and the expenses for such repairs were borne by mutual assessments made from time to time as needed. The repairs amounted to from $2 to $2.50 yearly for each farmer. The Nebraska Telephone Enpany at Norfolk furnished switching service for them and arranged connect them with the Norfolk subscribers or with long-distance lines, 1 for this service the farmers paid the same rates as the Norfolk sub - ibers. One of their number each month collected from the others the regular rates and whatever long-distance tolls had been incurred by any of them, and remitted the entire amount in one sum to the Nebraska Eephone company at Norfolk. The subscribers at Norfolk, or anyone distant points, who wished to talk with these several farmers, could 1 through the exchange at Norfolk and be connected with the farmers' line. There are only 10 farmers connected with the rural line in question, but it is their contention that their line is already burdened and is insuf - ficient to afford service for additional telephone users. The agreement, under which the farmers are acting, does not provide for taking in new members, nor for extending service beyond the lines already constructed. tit is the contention of the attorneys for the state that the rural tele - one line in question, having become connected with the Norfolk tele - phone system, has necessarily become an integral part thereof and, therefore, has become a common carrier. It is argued that the farmers on the rural line send messages to whomsoever they please, and hold themselves out as ready to accept and deliver all messages that may come to the rural line from subscribers at Norfolk and, in fact, from any part of the country over long-distance. tThe legislature denned common carriers, so far as that term is jiicable here, to be "telegraph and telephone companies â¢ â¢ â¢ engaged the transmission of messages * * * for hire." Rev. St. 1913, sec. 6124. In order that a company be a common carrier, it is essential, in view of this statutory definition, as well as by the generally recognized meaning of the term "common carrier," that the service rendered by it must be a service that is rendered for hire. It was said by Justice Story in Citizens Bank v. Nantucket Steamboat Co., 5 Fed. Cas. No. 2730, p. 719, 725: "I take it to be exceedingly clear that no person is a common carrier in the sense of the law who is not a carrier for hire; that i8, who does not receive or is not entitled to receive any recom - pense for his services. The known definition of a common carrier, in all our books, fully establishes this result." If no compensation is re - ceived, "he is not in the sense of the law a common carrier; but he is a mere mandatory, or gratuitous bailee; and of course his rights, duties and liabilities are of a very different nature and character from those of a common carrier." As pointed out in 10 C. J. 41, sec. 10: "The law applicable to common carriers is peculiarly rigorous, and it ought not to be extended to persons </seg>
            <seg id="p546">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 619 who have neither expressly assumed that character nor by their conduct and from the nature of their business justified the belief on the part of the public that they intended to assume it." It is quite apparent that the fanners, when they constructed the rural line in question, had no idea of rendering service to the public. Their sole purpose was to procure telephone service for themselves. It was to that purpose, and that purpose only, that they dedicated their property. To now subject that property to another purpose than that for which it was given, or intended to be used, would be to take from them the right and the use of the property which has not been volun - tarily yielded up. Where a person enters into the business of public service and operates as a common carrier, he voluntarily dedicates his property to the public use and acquiesces in a necessary public control of the business conducted ; but where there is no such dedication to the I.ublic use, the state has no arbitrary right to take from an individual the control of property devoted to private interests. The farmers who con - structed the line in Question did not provide that they would extend service to whomsoever might apply, nor that they would engage in the business of transmitting telephone messages. They have not become bound to each other, nor to the public in general, to see that their rural line is always in first-class order and that messages received will be promptly and efficiently transmitted. To hold them as a common carrier would fix a liability upon them for negligence in failing to keep their lines in efficient order. The lines that they have constructed are for their own private use, and certainly are subject to such control and provision for repair and maintenance as they themselves shall elect to adopt. It is argued that the rural line is similar to branch lines of a railroad which are constructed to meet the demands of some private industry and become part of the railroad system and subject to control as a lart of a common carrier. The case of Union Lime Co. v. Chicago &amp;. N. W. R. Co., 233 U. S. 211, is one of the cases cited as bearing out that contention. In that case it is to be noted that railway companies which were common carriers were given a statutory right to acquire necessary right of way and to extend spur tracks in order to meet the needs of manufacturing establishments, and that such a spur track, operated by a railroad company, was held to be a part of the railway system, and not a private side track belonging to the private establishment. In that case the court said (p. 222) : "There is a clear distinction between spurs which are owned and operated by a common carrier as a part of its system and under its public obligation and merely private sidings." The case of State v. Union Stock Yards Co., 81 Neb. 67, is relied upon as furnishing an analogy to the present case. There the court hold that the stock yards company, which operated tracks for the pur - pose of distributing cars of live stock, shipped in over various railroads. </seg>
            <seg id="p547">620 was a common carrier, though it distributed such shipments only to me several packing houses and industrial establishments directly con - nected with its lines. But in that case the Union Stock Yards company was engaged in the business of carrying freight, and held itself out to the public generally to receive all live stock shipped over the railroads and to carry it from the railroad terminus to its destination, and this service was rendered for hire. In that case it is said (-p. 82) : "If a person or a corporation holds itself out to the public as offering its serv - ices to all persons similarly situated, and performs a service in the trans - portation of persons, freight or intelligence, it is a common carrier in the particular spheres of such employment." Obviously;, the rule stated there has no application to the case under consideration. It is argued, since the rural line is partially constructed upon public highways and since our statute (Rev. St. 1913, sec. 7418) grants a right of way upon the public roads of the state to "any telegraph or telephone company incorporated or doing business in this state," that the de - fendant cannot deny that it is a common carrier, nor that it is subject to public control as such. That contention, however, is to mistake the tli'ect for the cause. Though the statute gives to all telephone compa - nies engaged in public service a right of way over the public roads, it does not follow that anyone who erects poles and strings telephone w:rts upon a public road is a telephone company or a common carrier. If the farmers' rural line is not the line of a "telephone company, " it may be that it has no right upon the highway and is there only by public suf - ferance, but the fact that it is on the highway certainly does not charac - terize the nature of the service which it renders. Again, it is contended that the property of the defendant is im - pressed with a public interest, for the reason that it monopolizes tele - phone territory. It is argued that the line extending through this ter - ritory and rendering the service that it does creates a situation which would render it unprofitable and impracticable for any other telephone company to extend a line into the same territory, by reason of the fact that so few are left to become subscribers. The situation may be a matter of public interest and may render impracticable the extension of telephone service in that territory, but, unless the rural line constructed by the defendant is a common carrier, it does not come within the juris - diction of the Railway Commission, no matter how great the public interest in the matter may be. The state, through its legislative author - ity, even though the enterprise is not a common carrier, may, when, it pleases, deem it wise to prevent such organizations from constructing tUcir lines upon or across the public highways, and thus save that ter - ritory to public service companies which will serve the entire community, but that is not a matter for the Railway Commission, nor, at this time, for the court to pass upon. In Illinois, where the law places public utilities and the property </seg>
            <seg id="p548">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 621 thereof, "devoted to public use," under the supervision of the Public Utilities Commission, it is held that a mutual telephone association, which has no charter authority to engage in public telephone service, to take on new members, or to devote its property to a public use, and is organized for the private use of its members only, and not for profit, is not within the jurisdiction of the commission as a common carrier. State Public Utilities Commission v. Bethany Mutual Telephone Ass'n., 270 111. 183, and State Public Utilities Commission v. Okaw Valley Mutual Telephone Ass'n., 282 111. 336. The court in the case first above cited said (p. 185): "To constitute a public use all persons must have an equal right to the use, and it must be in common, upon the same terms, however few the number who avail themselves of it. It is not essential to a public use that its benefits should be received by the whole public or even a large part of it, but they must not be confined to specified, privileged persons." In Missouri, where a statute, somewhat similar to our own, places under the Public Service Commission utilities engaged "in the conduct of the business of affording telephonic communications for hire," it was held, in State v. Public Service Commission, 272 Mo. 627, L. R. A. 1918 C, 820, that a mutual telephone company, the members of which own their own instruments and maintain their lines to a central station and contribute a quarterly amount to maintain such station, does not furnish telephonic communication for hire, although a fee is exacted in case a non-subscriber talks on a telephone on the company's switchboard to one on a connecting line. The court in that case said (p. B40) : "The con - stitution and by-laws and the oral testimony all point to the conclusion that the Auxvasse company is primarily a private organization not operated for hire. Operation for hire is a prerequisite to supervision by the Commission. The reason is plain. The Commission was created, as is evident from the entire statute defining its powers, not to interfere with individual action except where same assumes a public nature, but to provide regulations and give plenary power as defined by the statute to the Commission to control such utilities as from their nature and operations may affect the interest of the general public. All such organ - izations are commercial in their nature in that they are not conducted for favors, but for fees. Recognizing this fact, the framers of the public service act made this a condition precedent to commission control. That a fee may be exacted from non-subscribers for talking from a telephone on the company's switchboard to one on a connecting line does not militate against the correctness of the conclusion that this company does not afford telephonic communications for hire. â¢ â¢ â¢ The fee thus authorized to be charged is but an incident in the general conduct of the business of the company, and is not indicative of its character, which is to serve those who sustain it and not the general public." In the case under consideration, the association of these 10 fanners </seg>
            <seg id="p549">622 and their joint ownership in a rural telephone line, extending from Nor - olk to their properties, cannot be dignified by the appellation Of &amp; public irvice company. Their property has never been dedicated nor devoted o a public use. It was provided merely as a private convenience. These farmers do not pretend to, nor do they render a service to the public. 'hough outsiders may call them over their lines, they do not guarantee faithful and careful transmission of the message, nor are they Obligated 0 the public to any degree of care in keeping their lines in efficient readiness for use. They permit and invite such messages to come to them for their own convenience. They render no service, they make no irofit, they exact no compensation, and cannot be held to be "a telephone ompany engaged in the transmission of messages for hire," within the eaning of our statute. k Since they were not operating as a common carrier, the Railway mission has no jurisdiction, and the order made was without ority of law. The judgment of the trial court is therefore affirmed. IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF PLATTE COUNTY, NEBRASKA re State of Nebraska, Plaintiff, v.
