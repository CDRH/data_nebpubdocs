NEEDED LEGISLATION. 

Your attention is called to the tables in this report, she 
educational lands under sale and lease upon which interest and 
rental are delinquent and unpaid for more than one year, 
amounting, in the aggregate, to ninety-two thousand nine hundred 
and eighty-four dollars, being an increase of delinquency 
over the amount reported November 30th, 1880, of thirteen thou- 

sand nine hundred fifty dollars and forty-four cents. This, in 
view of the prosperous seasons of 1881 and 1882, can, in ray 
opinion be accounted for only in this way: 

Every act, amendatory and supplemental to the school land 
laws, passed since the organization of this Department has been 
so framed that purchasers and lessees have acquired all the privileges 
desired by them, and the interests of . the State have been 
ignored. The State has been legislated into court to contend 
for the title to its own lands against many irresponsible purchasers 
and lessees who have acquired an interest in school lands 
largely for the purpose of speculation, tailing in which, payments 
due the state are refused. 

In my opinion, the present law on the forfeiture of contracts 

should be so amended that after 
in default of payments for a reas 
linquency may be served on thei 
ter reasonable notice), to make 
Board of Educational Lands and 
tracts and again put the lands 

contractors shall have continued 
triable time, notice of their den, 
and upon their failure, 

payments due the State, the 
Funds should cancel such coninto 
the market, the same as 

though such contracts had never been made, and thereby save 
the trouble and expense of a delayed suit at law. 

OTOE AND PAWN'KE RESERVATIONS. 

Pursuant to the letter of the Honorable Commissioner of the 
General Land Office directed to v &gt;u, and under date of Deeem-</seg> 

            <seg id="p026">
ber 9th, 1880, wherein the State's claim for indemnity school 
hinds in lieu of sections sixteen and thirty-six, within the Otoe 
and Pawnee Reservations which had been disposed of by the 
• '(.n.ral Government, wm conceded and allowed, the Attorney 
t ii'iic-ral and myself, acting under orders of the Board of Educational 
Lands and Funds, did, on the 14th day of October, 1881, 
¦Meet, in lieu of a portion of the double minimum lands within 
said reservations, lands aggregating 11,944.6 acres, a list of 
which was tiled in the local Land Office at North Platte, Nebraska; 
but at this date, no report has been received of action, 
by the Honorable Commissioner of the General Land Office, 
thereon. The present dilatory manner of the General Government 
in tli. settlement of claims of this character convinces me 
that claims of thifl nature should have a personal representative 
at the Department in Washington for the reason that the official 
life ot any one Executive of the State Land Department is not 
long enough to procure the settlement of these questions by correspondence. 


LANDS DEEDED TO THE STATE UNDER ACT &lt; &gt;F 

FEBRUARY 

15th, 1877 

Under the act entitled, "An act to provide for the foreclosure* 
and collection of the Securities held by the Permanent School 
Fund of Nebraska," approved February loth, 1877, (section 9, 
page 487 of the Revised Statutes of 1881), there have been transferred 
to this office, abstracts of title and deeds of conveyance 
for the following described lands, to-wit : 

East half of section 6, township 9, range 5 east 

Northeast quarter of the northwest quarter of section 4, 
township 9, range 6 east. 

Korth half of the northeast quarter of section 12, township 9, 
¦«¦ 4 east. 

South half of section 12, township 4, range 5 west 

Southeast quarter of section 26, township 7, rang* i &gt; a-- 

26</seg> 

            <seg id="p027">

LANDS AND PIBLIC BUILDINOe. 

Containing in the aggregate nine hundred and twenty acres. 
Said deeds have been duly recorded in the several counties 
wherein the lauds lie, and the lands credited to the common 
school land account. 

During the period covered by this report there has been confirmed 
to the state the selection of the south half of section 19, 
township 7, range 12 east, and the south half of section 21, township 
7, rauge 12 east, in Otoe county, Nebraska, containing 
in the aggregate six hundred and seven and sixty-four-one-hundredths 
acres, selected by state authority, June 21st. l*tj-&lt;. and 
confirmed to the state under date of August 17th, 1882. 

With the view of arriving at some definite conclusion whereby 
the indemnity school lands due the state may be selected and 
confirmation to the state be secured I would respectfully call 
your attention to an extract from a letter from the Honorable 
Commissioner of the General Land Office to my predecessor, 
under date of July 8th, 1880, which is as follows: 

"With the view of satisfying the state for the indemnity still 
due it for deficiencies in sections 16 and 36 outside of Indian 
Reservations, I would suggest that you carefully examine and 
make up a list of the deficiences occurring in each of said 
tions, as shown by your records, giving credit against each section 
for the indemnity which may have been selected and approved, 
and transmit the same to this office for comparison with 
its record*. When this shall have been done and the two records 
made to agree as to the basis of further selection, it will expedite, 
and save from further complication, the adjustment of said 
grant. Unless such a course is taken a satisfactory settlement 
of said grant cannot be arrived at. " 

By referring to the printed report of my predecessor, page 30, 
it will be found that there is still due the state, of the class ¦&gt;! 
lands referred to by the Honorable Commissioner, over eight </seg>

            <seg id="p028">

thousand acres. From the very imperfect data in this office it is 
impossible to arrange the lists required by the Honorable 
Commissioner, but a visit to all the land offices in the state, 
where access can be had to the plats and records affecting sections 
sixteen and thirty-six in each township, is absolutely necessary, 
and the force of this Department will not admit of a 
detail sufficient to do the work required. 

In view of the facts that the state is fast being settled, and 
t the government lands are fast being peopled in the frontier 
nties, and the further fact that the state has a valuable interin 
its yet unconfirmed school land grant, I respectfully reimend 
that the Legislature make the necessary appropriation, 
that the Board of Educational Lands and Funds may be 
bled to secure the data and lists required by the Honorable 
nmissioner of the General Land Office, to the end that the 
m6 of the state in this behalf may be finally adjusted by the 
leral Government. 

PERMANENT SCHOOL FUND LOANS 

I am directed by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, 
report the following proposition and resolution in my bien-1 
report : 

PROPOSITION. 

To the Honorable Board of Educational Lands and Fm 

Gents : I propose to pay, on or before November 30th, 1882, 
or at such time as the Board of Educational Lands and Funds

tive hundred dollars, taking as security therefor, for the b&lt; 

of said fund, a mortgage upon 23 acres of land adjoining th 

corporate limits of Nebraska City. Nebraska, and 

Whereas, Default was made in the payment of said principal 

amount so loaned, and the interest thereon due said fund, and 

ifterwards, to-wit : at the April, 1879, term of district court ot 

Otoe county, a judgment was taken in favor of the state and 

igainst said Fulton for the sum of four thousand one hundred 

forty-threo and eighty-eight hundredths dollars, and the mortgaged 
premises ordered sold for the benefit of said Permanent 

School Fund. The said premises being, on the 25th day of Fel 

ruarv, 1880, bought in by the state, for the benefit of said schoo 

fund, for tte sum of sixteen hundred dollars, which said sum 

was so applied as a credit upon the judgment so a3 aforesaid ob- 

tained, and personal judgment taken against said Fulton for tin 

remainder, to-wit: two thousand, tive hundred forty-three and 

eighty-eight hundredths dollars, and 

Whereas, It is proposed by said Win. Fulton that if the' state 
of Nebraska will cancel and set aside the personal judgment so 
as above mentioned and will give him or his assigns a deed t" 
said 23 acres of land, he will, on or before the 30th day of N 
vember, 1882, or at such other time as the Board of Educational 
Lands and Funds may direct, pay, for the benefit of said fund, 
the sum of two thousand three hundred dollars, and, 

Whereas, The Board of Educational Lands and Funds, after 
due consideration do believe the offer of said Fulton is for the 
best interests of the state and the fund aforesaid, hut tind themselves 
unable to act in the premises, therefore, 

It is ordered, That the proposition of said Fulton be spread 
upon the records, and it and this resolution be submitted by the

Immissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, to the next Legisire 
with a recommendation that they take such action as may 
necessary to carry the proposition of said Fulton into effect. 

In pursuance of the foregoing resolution, I respectfully recommend 
that such action be taken by the Legislature as will authorize 
the Board of Educational Lands and Funds to accept the 
proposition of Wm. Fulton, M appears above. 

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT LANDS. 

ff this grant there was on hand November 30th, 1880, the 
h half of section 21, township 4, range 1 west, ami the northquarter 
of section 21, township 3, range 6 west, containing 
acres. 

On January 3d. 1882, the Board of Public Lands and Buildings 
ordered the north half of section 21, township 4, range 1 
. deeded to the Midland Pacific Railroad Company to correct 
an error in the deed made by said compan}-, July 19th, 1871. 
This leaves on hand the northeast quarter of section 21, township 
3, range 6 west, one hundred sixty acres, which, (renewing 
the recommendation of my predecessor) I would respectfully recommend 
be transferred to the school lands of the state. 

QAfl FIXTURES. 

I am directed by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings to 
call your attention to the appropriation made at the last regular 
session of the Legislature for carpeting the west wing of the new 
Capitol building. The amount appropriated was two thousand 
four hundred dollars, the amount actually used was one thousand 
seven hundred forty-five dollars and five cents, leaving a balance 
of six hundred fifty-four dollars and ninety-five cents, which, by

SEWERAGE 

I desire to call your attention to the present unfavorable con- 

dition of the Capitol building regarding mm 

Upon the completion of the west wing of the Capitol baild- 

1 nancy, it became evident that some tem- 

mg, an 

porary system of sewerage must be adopted in order thai 

boiler used for heating the building might be occasionally blown 

out and cleaned, and water closets kept in order for use. The 

architect of the building, Mr. Wileox, was consulted and hi* 

views adopted. The'otfesult was, si temporary sewer was laid 

through the corridor in the basement of the west wing and un- 

der' the walls of the building to a cesspool within the grounds. 

A well was sunk in the engine room where an abundant supply 

of water was found, which is elevated by a steam pump to an 

iron tank in the attic, from which a connection was made with 

the system of water pipes in the building, the several waste pipes 

being connected with the temporary sewer running to the i 

pool. This arrangement has been niiafactory to the present 
time: but an examination shows the cesspool to be rapidly tili- 

ng up, and the consequent necessity for a better system of sew 
rage before an irreparable injury ia done the Capitol building. 

I am unofficially informed that the citv of Lincoln is contem- 

plating the construction of a system of sewerage, under plans to 

be prepared by the City Council and Engineer. And M an inde- 

pendent system for the Capitol building alone, in view of this 

contemplated action of the city authorities, might result in much 

injury to the service and might be enjoined altogether, I think it 

best that the state should co-operate with the city in this behalf 

and respectfully recommend an appropriation bj the Legislature 

had tailed to make pr </seg>

            <seg id="p032">
for this purpose. The amount to be determined when plans for 
such work can be submitted to the proper Committee for their 

.iispectiou. 

IIuMK FOR THE FRIENDLESS. 

Kt.i Legislature of 1881, provided for the location of a Homt 
the Friendless at such town or city in Nebraska as should, 
r notice by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, "doi 
the largest amount to said Home." 

I ncler notice duly published, the city of Lincoln was the onlv 
bidder, and its proposition to donate two thousand and fifty dolto 
said home WtM accepted by said board, and by an order 
be Board of Public Lands and Buildings the said home for 
the friendless was located at Lincoln, Nebraska. 

I. tract of improved land, with buildings thereon, comprising 
and eighty-three-one-hundredths acres, at the south end ot 
?enth street, adjoining the city of Lincoln, was purchased for 
sum of two thousand one hundred dollars, and on the 24th 
of August, 1882, the contract for the erection of said home 
let, for the sum of three thousand five hundred ninety-nine 
in and seventy-seven cents, the Society of the Home for 
Friendless agreeing to pay such cost over the amount approted. 


I The building, although not entirely completed at present, 
i soon be turned over to said society, as contemplated by the 
providing for its location. 

CAPITOL BUILDING. 

I Since the last report from this Department, the west wing of 
Capitol building has been completed and has been occupied 
some of the Executive Departments since November, 1881. 

Pursuant to the act of March 1st, 1881, making appropriation 
for the east wing of the Capitol building, the Board of Public

            <seg id="p033">

PUBLIC LANDS AND BDILDINKB. 

Lands and Buildings proceeded to act. Mr. William H. Wilcox, 
architect of plans for the west wing, accepted the proviso contained 
in section one of mid act, and furnished plans with all 
details, specifications aud working detailed drawings, MOMHfj 
for the construction of said east wing. 

After due advertisement, as provided in section four of said 
act, the Board did, on the 13th day of July, 1881, award contract 
to W. H. B. Stout, tor the sum of ninety-six thousand eight 
hundred dollars. The construction of the building has progressed 
rapidly and it is almost completed, and will be prepared 
for occupancy at once, after tinal settlement with the contractor. 

The occupancy of the west whig and old Capitol building 
during the last winter ha.- HMMmI a deficiency in the appropriation 
" for fuel and lights," dso for " care of Capitol building and 
grounds," the exact amount of which cannot be determined, for 
it includes cost of " fuel and lights," from November 1st, 1882 
to March 31st, 1883, and is estimated at *2150. The deficiency 
on account of " care of Capitol building and grounds," is about 
$150.00. 

STATE PENITENTIARY. 

Your attention is respectfully called to the report ot the Warden 
of the State Penitentiary herewith submitted, and especially 
to the recommendations therein contained. It is noticeable to 
the casual observer, and more particularly brought to the notice 
of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, that the contract system 
now in force, whereby the lessee of the Penitentiary is 

compelled to pay all running expenses, has led. on the part of 
the State, to the very bad precedent of abandoning or refusinc 
to make many necessary permanent repair* and improvements. 
Especially is this the case regarding the water supply of said 
prison. That the water supply is not sufficient, and not in condition 
for immediate use in case of fire, cannot be chargeable to 
the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, but to the Legislature.

from whom the remedy and the money necessary to institute it, 
must come. Surely the officers of the Institution have done 
their whole duty in the premises, when they have repeatedly 
called attention to existing facts, and made, what to them, seemed 
proper recommendations. 

K'he location of the Penitentiary alone, (on low ground) is, of 
If, a demand that there should be a bountiful supply of water 
a perfect system of sewerage in connection with it. 

HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE 

Your attention in respectfully called to the report of the Superintendent 
of the Nebraska Hospital for the [mm and the recommendation; 
therein made. I especially desire to bring to 
your notice the fan* relating to the keeping of insane persons, and 
tin- BMUUMff in whicli it provides for the payment of the same by 
the several counties, with the view of having legislative attention 
called to the subject. There is now due this fund from the several 
counties $110,844.08. An examination of the list of delinquent 
counties compared with those that have paid promptly, under the 
law, will develop the tart that a few of the smaller counties in 
-tate have built the additions that have been made to the 
hospital building for several years, while the older and larger 
counties have furnished the most of the inmates, but have ignored 
the law altogether and contributed little or nothing toward the 
numerous additions made to the building for the accommodation 
of patients. A Bpirit of justice demands that all appropriations 
for the benefit of the hospital should either be made from the 
general fund, or that the counties largely delinquent should be 
made to pay their share of expense according to the number of 
inmates committed bv them. 

DEAF AND DUMB INSTITUTE

for other specific purposes, the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, 
after procuring plans and specifications as provided by law, 
and after due advertisement, awarded contract for the construction 
of said building on the 11th day of Julv. 1881, for the sum 
of fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty dollars. The building 
has been completed and is now used for dining room, chapel, 
school rooms, etc., and furnishes all the room nect-asary tor the 
coming two years. The institution has U.'.-n supplied with 
heating apparatus, telephone, engine and machinery for the workshop, 
but is sadly in need of more furniture, a barn, engine how 
and other improvements, necessary for tbc safe keeping and pro- 

n of state property. 

Your attention it respectfully called to the recommendations 
contained in the Superintendent's report. 

rXSTITCTE FOR THE BLIND 

During the past two years there have been but few repairs and 
improvements made to this Institute. Arrangements have been 
made for a better water supply in case of fire, by placing a large 
iron tank in the attic with down pipes and hose attachments on 
each floor with sufficient capacity to flood the building in a few 
moments. The Institute Building and work shop were badly 
damaged by a wind storm on the afternoon of September 29th, 
1881, when the work shop was unroofed ;uid a portion of the 
gable end of the main building blown in. Fortunately, no personal 
injury was received by the inmates, and the damage was 
soon repaired under supervision of the superintendent. This 
Institute should be supplied with gas and steam heating facilities, 
estimates for which, with other repairs desired, have been made 
and appear in the Auditor's report. 

REFORM SCHOOL. 

The Legislature of 1881 having provided by general law for 
the care and custody of juvenile offenders at the Reform School 
located near Kearney, Nebraska, and having granted to the </seg>

            <seg id="p036">
Board of Public Lands and Buildings the power to provide for 
their instruction and appoint a superintendent, steward, teachers 
and other officers, the board did, on the 29th day of April, 1881, 
appoint Honorable George H. Collins superintendent of said 
school at a salary of fifteen hundred dollars per year. The institution 
was formally opened in July, 1881 and at the present 
time is full to its utmost capacity. Had the law making appropriations 
for the transportation of persons convicted to serve 
sentences in the state penitentiary been construed by the courts 
to have covered the nfatter of expense in transporting juvenile 
offenders to the reform school, there iB no question but what the 
institution would have been full within ninety days from its 
opening. As the matter now stands the expense of such transportation 
has been borne by counties, cities and villages making 
the commitments, without any authority of general law, as I 
understand the case. 

In my opinion, the successful operation of the State Reform 
&gt;ol is one of the important considerations that demand 
legislative attention. The fact that it is possible to take juvenile 
offenders from their haunts of vice and crime, commit them to 
a reformatory school, give them a good common school education 
and return them at maturity to good uses in society, is a 
matter that should receive the earnest attention of every legislator 
to whom these waifs must look for a useful life. I am instructed 
bj the Board of Public Lands and Buildings to recommend the 
construction of another building or buildings sufficient to enlarge 
the ciipiicitv of the institution to at least one hundred and fifty 
inmates, and the appropriation of money sufficient to furnish and 
run the same when built. 

&lt;i KXERAL REMARKS. 

Eiference was made under the head of "Needed Legislation, '" 
desired change in the school land law regarding the forfeitof 
contracts of long delinquent lessees and purchasers of 
)1 lands. Further, in this connection I desire to say, this

feature of the present law is not more objectionable than severa 
others which I did not particularly mention. Considering tha 
the law in question was framed and passed in 1877 before th 
organization of this department and before it was known jm 
what was needed in the then emergency; that the businethi~ 
department has grown to almost wonderful proportions 
that many complications arise and advantage! arc taken in th 
pnrchasing and leasing of school land prejudicial to the interest 
of the school land fund, it cannot be doubted that the preset 
law is inadequate. Presuming that the more effectual way t 
Becure the changes desired would be to present the matter to th 
coming Legislature in a manner for their intelligent action. 
have concluded to arrange in proper form, a bill to be approvec 
by the Board of Educational Lands ;md Funds, covering th 
whole matter, and submit it to the proper committee for the 
recommendation. 

A.n examination of the tables in this report will show 274 

699.70 acres of educational lands leased during the past two 

vears, with an estimated valuation of $824,099.10. The number 

of acres sold, 88,627, for the sum of S657.971.42, or an average 

of $7.42 per acre. Number of acres owned by the state Novem- 

ber 30th, 18S2, 2,582,366.65. The amount of interest bear- 

ing Educational Permanent Funds on hand November 30th, 

1882, $2,329,059.07, of which amount $1,529,316.21 is represent- 

ed by notes given for unpaid purchase price of lands sold. Of 

the 2,582,366.65 acres on hand November 30th, an examination 

of the records since the tables in this report were compiled shows 

217,080 acres to be under contract of sale, 489,440 acres under 

contract of lease, leaving )1,872,846.65 acres vacant and subject 

to sale or lease after appraisement. 

Before concluding this report I desire to call your attention to 

the successful operation of the several state institutions of which 

the Board of Public Lands and Buildings are the directing power. 

This success is largely due to those in immediate control. Ap- 

pointed to their several positions by yourself, it is a matter for </seg>

REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC LANDS AND BUILDINGS. 

Ijratulation by the people of the state, aud especially of the 
rd of Public Lands and Buildings, that the mantle has fallen 
n those so eminently qualified to discharge the duties devolvupon 
them. During the past two years not a single comnt 
has been filed against the superintendents of the several 
itutions, and therefore, no investigations have been made by 
Board of Public Lands and Buildings. This is exceedingly 
ifying, considering it includes the charitable, reformatory and 
al institutions. 

E behalf of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, I deto 
tender each and all of them the thanks that are due for 
courtesy, efficiency and reliability in the several positions 
so successfully fill. 

It is a pleasant duty to make honorable mention of my corps 
assistants who have industriously applied themselves in the 
vice of the State. The fact that I am able to place this report 
two years' business in your hands within three days from its 
se, is sufficient evidence of their efficiency and skill. 

E conclusion, allow me to thank you for the uniform courtesy 
many acts of kindness shown me during the past two years 
e in the discharge of my official duty. 

Respectfully submitted, A. G. KENDALL, </seg>
