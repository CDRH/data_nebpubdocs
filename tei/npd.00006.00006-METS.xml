Poynter, Qovernor of Nebraska: Deab Sis — In compliance with the law in this case made and provided, I herewith transmit the Annual Report of the Nebraska State Poultry Association for the year 1900.

Members of the Nebraska State Poultry Association, Ladies, and Gentlemen: According to custom it becomes my duty, as executive, to review the work intrusted to us the past year and recom - mend a course to those who succeed us. The last annual show, which was held at Lincoln, started in handicapped by the smallest amount of money in the treasurer's hands, to pay premiums, that we ever have had. Less than $700 of the State appropriation was left. The balance of the f 1,000 had been drawn to pay premiums of the previous show held at Fremont. However, by strict economy and a large reduction of operating expenses, we found, upon paying all claims against the Association, that the show was a financial success, leaving a small balance in the treas - ury. Much of the credit of the economical management ef the last show should be given our present efficient Secre - tary. Phikxd, Nkb., January IB, 16, 17, 18, 1900. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">6 PROCEEDINGS OP THE A few weeks after the close of the show I was notified by several members of the Association that the Finance, Ways, and Means Committee of the House had cut our appropria - tion down to $1,500. As soon as I could I went to Lincoln and, in company with the Secretary, sought an interview with the committee, to whom I pointed out, in my humbl way, the necessity of giving us the original appropriation but it was of no avail. It passed the House that way. I late made another trip to Lincoln, and after considerable lobby ing, we succeeded in getting the Senate to add the $500, to which the House concurred later. I am glad to-night to say that the entire appropriation was allowed. During the year many suggestions have come to my mind which I have arranged as logically as possible, and I present them to you for your consideration. It seems to me that our premium list needs a complete revision as well as the rules and regulations. This should be done by a competent committee. I would recommend to this committee to make a number of additions, includ - ing premiums on eggs, dressed poultry, and a cash gold special sweepstake premium offered by the Association. I would also recommend the organization of state specialty flubs of all the popular varieties, and get each club to put up a silver cup or cash special to be competed for by mem - bers of the club only. Wherever the show is held the coming year, I would say to every member of the Society that if we all make a united effort we can make it the greatest show in the history of the Association. Let us start in the new century with renewed energy and determination to push ahead. I would further recommend the appointment of a com- </seg>

This committee should confer with the Board and recommend the erection of a large, roomy, well lighted build - ing. Many of you are probably aware that our annual report has not been issued on account of the printers having the contract burning out. How soon it will be issued I am at present unable to say. And now, gentlemen, at the close of this year's labor, as I surrender this chair to my successor, allow me to thank your Board of Managers and Secretary especially for the hearty support and kind assistance extended to me during the year. Whatever good I have done for the Society, you are all heartily welcome. All is peace and harmony, and I return to you the office with the same warm feeling I had when I accepted it a year ago.
