            <seg id="p003">WOODWORKING EXERCISES FOR HOME AND SCHOOL. A. A. BAER. ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING. This bulletin is published to meet the demand for something definite in Manual Training where materials, tools, and equip - ment are limited. It is intended to give information and direc - tions for those who have had a limited amount of instructional work, and for any who desire to do beginning work along these lines. The knowledge of the use and care of tools, as well as a train - ing of the mind to direct, and the hand to execute, gained in working out these exercises, may be applied in construction and repair work about the home or on the farm. The interest created frequently arouses interest in other branches of school work, for the active hand is often the means of making a more active mind. Exercises have been selected which do not require expensive materials or special machinery, but rather such as are within the reach of all. EQUIPMENT. Drawings are shown and dimensions given for a work bench, a sawhorse, and a miter box, — three things which are necessary and should be provided for the wood shop. BENCH. The size given for the bench makes it convenient where space is limited. This type can be made in any length where a bench for the farm or general repair shop is desired. The drawer in the center is large enough to contain the tools generally used. The space inclosed at each end is intended for nails, screws, sandpaper, or any kind of finishing materials. Material used in construction can be obtained at any lumber yard, and need not be expensive. A good grade of lumber, however, will be more satisfactory. SELECTION AND CARE OF TOOLS. Tools as well as implements or machinery should be selected with care. It is not economy to buy cheap tools, because they are usually inferior either in workmanship or quality, and good </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Extension Bulletin 35, College of Agriculture. tools are essential to good work. Buy tools manufactured by an establishment of good reputation. It is usually a guaranty of quality. It is also important to have a good dry place for tools, and to return them after using, each to its proper place. Oil can be used sparingly on bright tools to prevent rusting. Rust can be removed by using pulverized pumice stone, which can be pur - chased at any hardware or drug store for about 10 cents a pound. All edge tools should be kept well sharpened, as good work cannot be done with dull tools. Plane bits, chisels, etc., are ground at an angle of about 25 degrees and then sharpened on an oilstone at an angle of about 30 degrees, as shown in Figure 1. Fig. 1. -Proper manner of sharpening tools A 10-point (10 teeth to the inch) crosscut saw will provt satisfactory for general use in the school shop when only one saw is used. If only a few tools can be purchased, the following will answer very nicely: 1 crosscut saw &lt; 10 pt. 24 in. ) $1.65 1 rule 40 1 try-square 40 1 jack plane 2.00 1 chisel (§ in.) 50 1 hammer .75 1 oilstone 1.00 6.70 A work bench of pine, like the one shown in the cut, made by students in the Agricultural Engineering Shops, University Farm, will be furnished schools taking up this work, for the cost of material and crating, which is $8. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">Woodworking Exercises for Home and School. 7 MATERIALS. Pine, poplar, or any of the soft woods can be used for these exercises, except the hammer handle, which should be a piece of straight-grained second growth hickory. Some of the other exercises can be made from goods boxes, or such other inexpensive material as the student may be able to obtain. Hard woods are difficult to work, and their use should not be attempted until the student has had some practice with the soft woods and some experience in keeping tools sharp and m good order. FINISHING. Paints, stains, and varnishes are used to preserve and beautify the woods they cover. Paint is applied to outside work or cheaper woods. Interior woodwork, furniture, etc., are finished in the natural wood, or stained and then waxed or varnished. With soft or close-grained woods, such as pine and poplar, the use of a filler is not so essential as in the use of coarse-grained woods such as oak and ash. However, a better body is secured and a nicer finish is obtained if a coat of shellac or some kind of clear filler is used after the stain and before either the wax or the varnish is applied. Prepared stains in any color can be obtained from paint dealers in half pint cans at 20 cents each. Filler or shellac can be purchased in small quantities at a cost of about 25 cents a pint. Prepared wax can also be obtained in small cans as low as 10 cents each. The wax is applied with a cloth and after 15 minutes is rubbed to a finish with a clean cloth or with waste. Varnish should be applied with a brush and allowed to stand at least 48 hours, or until perfectly dry and hard. It can then be rubbed down to a polish with pulverized pumice stone and oil. Use a good grade of paints, stains, varnish, etc. EXERCISES. EXERCISE NO. 1. Material.— 1 piece pine J"x7J"xl5 To be used first as a planing, squaring, and marking exercise.) Select the best side of the piece as a working face; plane this side lightly and mark it A. Next select the best edge as a work - ing edge. Plane straight and square it from face A, and mark this edge B. From the edge B, the side C can be squared; and from the side A, the edge D can be squared and gauged to the proper size. 'Dimensions are usually expressed in feet and inches thus, (') denote* feet and (") inches, x denotes by or times. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Extension Bulletin 35, College of Agriculture. 8 On the face A from edge B, lay off points a with pencil and rule 1" apart; then thru these points, with pencil and try - square, draw lines ab, etc. Lay off the points cd, etc., \" apart; then with pencil and rule, draw parallel lines cd thru these points. On face C lay off the points ef 1\" apart and draw lines ef, etc., thru these points with pencil and try-square. Lay off the points ij, etc., f" apart, and with pencil and rule, draw lines thru these points parallel to edge B. The lines fg, fh, etc., are drawn with the bevel set at an angle of 45 degrees. Fig. 4. Bread board. To set the bevel, place its handle on the inside of the blade or tongue of the framing square; then adjust the bevel blade until one side of it is exactly over the line at figures S and 3 or 2 and 2 on the two legs of the square. After the marking is com - plete and the teacher has seen it, plane off all marks and cut the board to 7"xl4". Then mark out the corners and cut them off as shown. Bore the hole with a \" bit. To prevent splitting when boring the hole, bore from one side until the point of the bit comes thru; then remove the bit, insert it from the other side, and carefully finish the hole. Sandpaper carefully length - wise with the grain of the wood. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Woodworking Exercises for Home and School 9 EXERCISE NO. 2. JOINTS. Fig. 5. — Joints Material. Two pieces \"\\\"x&lt;o" for each joint A and C are butt joints. In A, both pieces are sawed off square and nailed together. C is a modified butt joint, giving additional strength. Mark off a line c on one piece as shown in Figure 5, B on edge 6 at a distance from the end equal to the thickness of the other piece and equal in length to two-thirds the thickness of the first piece. From the end of line c on edge 6, and a similar line on opposite edge d, draw lines to end of piece and parallel to face o; draw line / on end of piece, connecting these two lines and parallel to face a. Square a line across face e, connecting c with line on opposite edge. Place the piece on the bench with face a down, and saw along this, connecting line to the depth of c. Place the piece in the vise and saw along the line / or remove with a chisel the piece cut out. The pieces are then ready for nailing. D is a halved joint formed by removing one-half the thickness from one piece and one-half from the other and then fastening together with nails or screws. Each piece is laid out similarly to the first piece in joint c. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Extension Bulletin 35, College of Agriculture. *- E shows the edge of both pieces in joint D. F is a miter joint, where the two pieces are cut at an angle of 45 degrees, and then fastened together. Directions for obtaining this cut are given in Exercise No. 1, also in 10 and 11. EXERCISE NO. 3. BIRD HOUSE. Fig. 6.— Bird house Material.— Pine, soft wood. Can be made from goods boxes or any Bottom.— 1 piec xlO' Sides. — 2 pieces bj x7". Ends.— 2 pieces 6"x5".

The roof is one-half pitch, found by taking 2\" on the blade of the framing square (the run) and 2\" on the tongue of the framing square (the rise) and cutting along the diagonal or connecting line, leaving the side of the house 3^" high. Bore holes in the front end, using right sized bits. The hole for wrens should be 1" or the size of a quarter; otherwise sparrows or larger birds will enter. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Woodworking Exercises for Home and School. 11 Nail the ends on the sides, using 1" brads or small nails. Next nail on the bottom and then the roof. The house may be sandpapered and painted if desired. EXERCISE NO. 4. BOOKRACK Fig. 7. -Bookrack. Material.— Pine or some of the harder woods. Made from one piece of wood, except two pieces |"xl"x6" for cleats. Cut a board 6"xl5" and surface it on all sides. Then mark it as shown at Figure 7, A. Bore the holes b and c and saw on the lines d and e and with a compass saw cut the line /. The other end is laid out and cut in the same way. A compass or keyhole saw is best for sawing out the ends. Smooth the pieces carefully and mark design on the ends with dividers or compass; then cut carefully with the point of a jackknife. Nail cleats on the under side as supports for the ends, being careful to have them \" plus the thickness of the Jle ce from the ends. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Extension Bulletin 35, College of Agriculture. Start a \\" nail, \" plus half the thickness of the end pieces, from the ends of the bottom; then insert the end pieces and drive in the nails. The nails make a hinge for the ends so they can be folded in, but the ends can be fixed stationary by screwing them to the crosspieces. EXERCISE NO. 5. TIE RACK Material. — May be soft or hard wood. Back.— 1 piece J"x3"xl6". Crossbar.— 1 piece i"x*"xl3f ". Ends.— 2 pieces f "x2"x2*". Plane and cut back and end pieces to sizes given. Mortise or cut ends into back }" deep as shown by dotted lines. (Fig.8.) Draw a line f" from each end. Inside these lines after the end pieces have been brought to proper size, place each end piece and mark carefully along the remaining side and both edges with sharp pencil, cut along inside the lines with chisel and mallet, holding the straight edge of the chisel next to the lines. Into the mortise thus made, place the end, which becomes the tenon, J" deep. Now plane rod or crossbar either octagonal or round, and cut just long enough to fit in the holes in the ends, with rods in place on the back. Insert the rod, put the ends in place, and fasten with a screw into each end, as shown in Figure 8. Clamp the ends in the vise to prevent splitting while boring the hole for the rod. Be careful that the point of the bit does not go thru. Chamfer or bevel the front edge of back about \", as shown in Figure 8. i "- ry'-tzzatiT it,- &gt;\* \+3"M Fig. 8. -Tie rack. </seg>

Mark ends and work them out, which can be done with compass saw and draw - ing knife or wood file and sandpaper. Bore holes in ends as indicated in drawing, clamping pieces in vise to prevent split - ting. Cut a groove on the inside of one end, as indicated by dotted lines, a a, the same depth as the hole so that the roller can be removed. Gain and fasten the ends into the back, as shown in Figure 8. Plane the roller to 1^" square; then with the plane take off each corner until it becomes an octagon. Plane off the remaining corners until all sides are equal; then finish rounding with a wood file and sandpaper. Mark off a line \" from each end of roller; saw around this line by holding in miter box or vise, and remove with knife or chisel, leaving bear - ing in center of each end \" in diameter. </seg>

Chamfer top edge of bottom i" to remove sharp corner. Fasten ends on to bottom with four \%" No. 8 flathead screws. Place side pieces as shown by drawing and fasten them on with §" roundhead brass screws as indicated. Bore small holes for screws to prevent splitting. EXERCISE NO. 8. KNIFE AND FORK BOX Material. — Pine or soft wood. Bottom. — 1 piece Plane sides and ends and bring them to 2\" in width. Square ends and cut them 1\" long. Square sides and cut 12" long. Be sure both sides are same length and both ends the same length; otherwise the box will not be square. Nail the sides on the ends with three \\" brads or small nails. Next plane one edge of the bottom and square both ends to this edge. Mark the bottom the same length as the sides. When nailing the bottom on, nail the smooth edge on to the side first, allowing the other edge to project over the side; then plane this edge off after it is nailed on. Bring the end piece even with the squared end of the bottom, Center. — 1 piece J"x4"xll' Sides.— 2 pieces J"x2i"xl2' Ends.— 2 pieces \"x2\"xl\' </seg>

Measure down 2|" from the top of each leg for the rail and taper from this point the two inside edges, removing J" from the lower end of each, leaving the leg 1" square at the bottom and straight on the out - side. After being shaped, the pieces may be brought to the same size by placing one straight side of two of the legs together and the other straight side down on the bench and planing lightly. Next plane the rail f"x2j" and cut in the miter box. Make the marks on the rail a d cut from the finished side to insure a smooth joint. Cut two ends 10J" long, and two sides 12|" long. Be sure both ends are the same length and both sides the same length. Nail the end pieces on legs first, using try-square as indicated. Next nail side rail on mitered end of end rail, nailing the mitered corners or rails together first and nailing into the legs afterwards. Set the nail by driving the nail heads into the wood with a nail set or small punch and smooth the rails with plane and sand - paper. Plane the top all over and turn the entire stand upside down on the bench. Place the rail on the top so as to show the same margin all around. Hold top and rail together and carefully turn over. Place the edge of rail on the top of the bench and nail thru from the top of the stand. Place three nails on each side and two on each end; set the nails and smooth the top with plane and sandpaper. (To be finished with one coat of golden oak stain, one coat of shellac, and two coats of varnish. It should be polished with pumice stone after each coat of varnish.) </seg>
