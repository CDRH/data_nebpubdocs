Where once the red man found winter shelter among forests and the clay hills of eastern Nebraska, we find today, mag - em orchards producing hundreds of car-loads of fruit that can not 'xcellad by any country in the universe. Throughout the remaining portion of the state, which at one time was used as a hunting ground by numerous tribes of Indians, we find beautiful farms, some exceptionally well improved, and some not 30 well improved. In our mind's eye, we look back to the pioneer days and we see the sod houses and dug-outs giving way to frame shacks, and these in turn to more permanent dwellings, which for several years were used as a back-ground for a setting of weather beaten machinery und sick pigs. What a contrast we see today. All the best improved farms are equipped with well kept orchards and gardens, sheltered by wind-breaks, plenty of shade trees, and beautiful lawns dotted with shrubs and flowers, whose beckoning eyes and out-stretched arms seem to bid us behold the stately mansions which are beautifully adorned with robes of nature's beauty.

Yes, folks, we need a larger membership. Can any one give a good reason why we should not measure up to standard? Look at Minnesota, for instance: she has a membership of 3,300. Nebraska produces better soil for fruit growing and being located farther south, in a warmer climate, we can grow more ornamentals than she can. Our citizens are just as progressive, but we have never gone out with a determination to stand by the guns until our membership has equaled that Of other states.

Howard, University of Nebraska, at the annual meeting at Lincoln, Tuesday, January 4th. Prof. Howard called attention to the opportunities for the develop - of the grape industry, referring to vineyards in Douglas and Netnaha counties, referred to profits the growers were receiving from their vineyards and called special attention to the adaptability of the iuid the climatic conditions along the Missouri river which should ncourage a wider planting and development of this industry. He poke of strawberry growing, also cane fruits and currants, and inted out the commercial opportunities offered in this line of fruit &gt;wing. He also called attention to the need of commercial plant- cherries and plums. One of the most interesting points in the 'ssor's lecture was the opportunity referred to for the development arming industries in the western and northwestern part of the slut.- where lands are cheaper and crops suitable for canning factories, which can be grown with much less difficulty than in the eastern part tate. Sweet corn and all sorts of vine crops are not subject to the 3 and insect enemies which become troublesome in other par's it ||M state. Prof. Howard suggested that the Horticultural Sociery would investigate the present supply and opportunities for growing IfeOT crops along the Platte river and throughout the northern anil w.surn part of the state and that the Society should interest canning factories and call their attention to the opportunities offered for suc- ul vegetable growing in the territory referred to. Industries of this kind would tend to advance and promote vege - table growing as market crops and would no doubt be a source of profit to producers and manufacturers. In conjunction with the can - ning factory and as separate industries. Prof. Howard referred to the opportunities for vegetable production. Most of the vegetable seeds tor garden planting and field use are at the present time shipped into the state from outside concerns. The remainder of the discussion of the subject assigned Prof. Howard is given in his paper which follows: The subject which has been assigned to me is so general and in - cludes so many crops, I have deemed it inadvisable to enter into a detailed discussion of each of these crops. I have therefore, selected the apple as the chief topic of my paper. I !&gt; Prof. It. F. HoManl </seg>

Our central location with regard to the markets. L3rd. Our exceptionally favorable soil conditions in certain parts the state. 4th. Our relatively low cost of production 5th. Probable future prices. Government statistics show that there has been a steady increase in orchard planting throughout the country since 1890, except for th - past five or six years. It is interesting to note that the production has not kept pace with the increased planting. The total yield of apples in five-year periods is as follows: These estimates are based upon the total production which in - ludes the apples from home orchards. A very small per cent of the pples from home orchards ever appears on the market. The com - mercial crop of apples would represent roughly, about sixty-five per ent of the total yield. The price of apples depends largely upon the iie of the commercial crop that reaches trade channels and not upon He yield from farm orchards. During the twenty-year period between 890 and 1910 there was a great increase in commercial orchard plant - ing — particularly in the western states. On the other hand the home or farm orchard has each year been playing a smaller part in affecting the price of the commercial crop. As a result, our total production since 1890 has remained about the same, which our commercial pro - duction has increased materially. In considering the future of apple growing it is probably correct to assume that the price of apples will be even more largely determined by the fruit that is grown in com - mercial orchards which receive scientific care.

['he rive states mentioned have for the past five years produced approxi- m -third of the total crop of the country. i required several years for heavy plantings to be reflected gh prices. A larger part of the increased production of the west past few years is due to the planting that was made from 1900 to 10. There has been very little commercial planting in the United States since 11110, as compared with the ten-year period preceding that itat •■. With the execption of the Shenandoah-Cumberland district, we may expect to see all of the production centers east of the Rocky Mountains either actually decrease in production or remain at a stand si ill tor the next few years. The Pacific Northwest has probably ap - proached its maximum production unless planting is renewed. These general statements regarding the present status of production and production centers are made with a view of showing that there is no immediate danger of an over-production in so far as the Central West is concerned. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT There are other reasons why we may not expect to see good apples grown in well cared for orchards, selling for less than a dollar a bushel for several years. The market for apples is broadening each year. Our population has increased about 30,000,000 in the last twen - ty-five years. The census reports show that the proportion of our population living in cities and towns has been increasing until now over 50 per cent of our total population may be classed as consumers These two things alone would normally take care of an enormous increase in production, provided the apple crop could be properly dis - tributed. The war has no doubt retarded the development of our foreign market for apples. European markets as well as the Orient and South America furnish tremendous possibilities as consumers of the American apple. Our export trade before the war was over 2,000,000 barrels. Direct trade with South America did not begin until 1910. The shipments direct to South America increased approxi - mately 400 per cent in the first four years after direct trade began. These factors for increasing the demand for apples are likely to pre - vent any serious over production. The lack ol planting since 1910 is apt to have, a pronounced effect within the next few years in causing an actual shortage of apples. The soil and climate of eastern Nebraska are exceptional! able for growing apples of high quality. The loess soil torn tributary to the Missouri River is an ideal orchard soil. It r. the elements of fertility for several feet below the surface. Us in ical structure is such as to permit the tree roots to penetra great depth.

I have not attempted to arrive at a figure representing the cost of producing a bushel of apples in eastern Nebraska. It is evident, how- the western growers' largest cost items would be among our smaller ones. For instance, 20 cents per bushel is charged as interest ( $1,038 per acre valuation) and 75 cents as freight. Let us ■HUM that all items of cost for growing apples in eastern Nebraska are as high as the figures quoted for Yakima, except these two. Ten cents per bushel would cover interest on an investment of $300 valua - tion, assuming a 250 bushel yield. Thirty-five cents per bushel will pay freight on our apples to points 600 miles away. It would appear then, that the apple grower in Nebraska would have an advantage of at least 50c per bushel in growing and marketing his crop. If the "balance of trade" in apple production for the next gener - ation is going to be in the states west of the Rocky Mountains, may we not expect to see apples selling at a figure that will cover the cost </seg>

Where g» ad winces in the selling price of commodities, which enter the life of the average American citizen, are still higher than the age advances in freight revenues, it must either mean that the road companies are not yet getting all that they are entitled to, in that there has been profiteering in private business. It may mean a little of both. As a matter of fact, railroad finances have been in the doldrums for three years, due to the fact that they were in a competitive field in cost of operation and were not free as was private business to change freely the selling price of what they had to offer. The net result was that while private business flourished, this semi-public business of the public utilities languished, and while private business was more prosperous than at any time in your and my knowledge, the semi-public business was facing harder problems than ever be - fore.

But at the same time this coal is laid down at such a price that the wood cutter in the neighboring timber country finds himself, under present labor costs, unable to compete satisfactorily.

A very considerable business has developed in truck freight hauling of grain, for which the stand - ard charge is one cent per bushel per mile. This is hardly a fair comparison because truck hauling is short distance hauling and in - volves the expense of loading and unloading, which also makes up a considerable part of the expense of railroad freight hauling. I spoke a few moments ago of the financial distress that over - took the railroad carriers of the country during the abnormal period of the war. Permit me to analyze this situation briefly. In the w. si the average rate level increase up until August 25, 1 1*20, was Slightly over twenty-five per cent. On some commodities it was very distinctly ever this amount. On others, such as lumber and coal, it was lower. The average, however, was slightly over twenty-five per cent.

Business points like Minneapolis and St. Paul, served by rail - oads that have not been getting along well financially, which mil oads needed all the increases granted; would be unable to compete ith business points like Omaha, which is largely served by prosperous railroads. This situation could be multiplied indefinitely, showing very disastrous effects on business, very probably, if freight rates were not fairly uniform as between carriers in competing territory. Con - gress wrestled with this problem extensively a year ago and the best they could make out of il was that they would provide for earnings which would give a fair return on all railroads as an average and then the federal government would take the exress from the w roads. Whether this can legally be doiw will be a question f courts to determine. This leads me to the last point 1 wish to touch upon, which I \ ture to do even to the extent of stretching your patience. The m ing of freight rates by the federal government tinder an act of c gress, covering all railroads in a general way, and Um knocking ii by the federal commission of the powers of the states themselves policing rate levels within their borders, raise a question that is very considerable moment to you who are shippers. If the p ciple is established by the courts, as laid down by congress and as ing administered by the Interstate Commerce Commie right of the federal government to impose its will whet- in the matter of railroad transportation, it is just a que a tew years, if congress so wills, when all matters relating to railroads will be handled by the federal government. This might not be a serious thing to look at if the organization of supervision did not become so gigantic as to be well nigh inoperative. Bureaucratic government is Cdom satisfactory. It is obvious that as the time comes when all .tters of station facilities, conditions of stockyards, locations of in - dustry track sites on right-of-way for industries, schedules of trains, and what not, will be handled directly from Washington by a ma - chinery bo complex, it is worthy of your careful attention as to whether complaints of individuals and ordinary organizations will ever receive the attention they deserve. We do not yet know whether the courts will sustain the attitude of the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion, that congress has taken from the states all power over general </seg>

But if it i, then the question becomes one of policy at once as to whether people of the nation desire congress to continue its general plan ready enunciated and to that extent it becomes a legislative ques - oii. Amendments to the transportation act are to be proposed to the exi congress for the purpose of heading off any intention on the part f the railroad companies to establish more deeply the purpose of the ongress to take over all regulations of railroads. Your attention is nvited to that legislation. It is a matter entirely of policy as to what people of Nebraska want their representatives in congress to do in matter. I am presenting it to you in this brief way for what It worth I'UOKITS IX Al'PLK (iltOWINU. By J. K. Shubert, Shubert, Nebraska Mr. President, Members of the State Horticultural Society, Ladies Gentlemen : When your secretary invited me to talk to you on the subject of •rolits in Apple Growing in Nebraska," I told him that if I should permitted to relate some of my own personal experiences and ideas, d to give some facts and figures that have actually come under my wii observation, I would be pleased to accept. It has been my idea that in addition to the able and valuable papers and discussions by our college professors and others along scientific lines, we should hear more of the practical and actual experi - ences of the men who have spent many years in the apple growing business. I do not mean to speak disparagingly of such men as Prof. Hop - pert, Prof. Howard and Dr. Condra, and many others who are devoting their lives to scientific research; far from it, because I recognize the valuable work they have done and the inestimable importance of the information that they have worked out for us and given to us per - sonally and by the bulletins sent out from the State Experiment Sta - tion. They cover a field of usefulness that we growers can not enter, because we are not trained along those lines; so they teach us how to plant and prune and cultivate and spray, how to control disease; in fact, they have discovered so many things that they have passed along </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL RKPORT tus that we growers would be in a sorry plight indeed if it wen* n them. The subject of apple growing is so broad and there are so many things that enter into the question, as to whether thei«' will ultimately be a profit or a loss, it seems to me that it will be necessary to start .11 the very beginning and consider briefly some 01 the things that are essential in growing an orchard that will be likely to show a balance on the credit side of the ledger. tAs my experience in apple growing for the last twenty-five veins s been confined to the eastern side of the state, I will have in mini a greater degree the conditions as they exist there. However, I am ite sure that the same general program should be carried out wher- ever apples can be successfully grown tin starting this orchard I would select a tract of land of fair 1 quality, with elevation enough to insure good water drainag rolling enough to provide for sufficient air circulation to minimi, the danger from frost kGood black soil, with porous clay sub-soil is ideal Rfer land that had been in cultivated crops tor MN ly corn land. The most important item in starting to grow a commercial orchar s good trees. I would go to a reliable nursery firm, such as we ha\ wo or three in this state, and place my order for the required nun er of well selected trees. I would prefer two-y car-old trees, althoug ood results may be obtained from one-year-old treeii, and if th" twc ear-old trees are not in stock I would not hesitate to use them, i fact, I have done so with equally good results It is important that these trees be good, clean stock, fre E&gt;ase, with a good root system and sound bark, of standard and tried ieties, such as Winesap, Jonathan, Crimes Golden, Virginia Beauly Black Twig. We have had such good results with Ben Davis and Gano ihat if were planting a new commercial orchard I doubt if I could resist planting a block of each; they are hardy and heavy bearers, long keep - rs, and the best bulk shippers we know of, and in spite 01 the many harsh words said and the unkind jokes that have been poked at Ben Javis, the fact remains that it is one of I he best money makers we have, and when some of our scientific brethren find a way to control he canker to which these last varieties are subject and I feel sure hey will — then these two varieties will take their place among the highly profitable sorts in the commercial orchards of Nebraska. Now comes another very important item in the growing of a profitable orchard; the setting of the trees. Line the rows up so that </seg>

There are several ways of doing this which I will be xplain to any one wishing the information. Holes must be enough in diameter to admit all the roots being straightened and deep enough so that the tree can be set two or three inches per than if stood in the nursery row. The soil in the bottom must loosened up so that the tree will stand in soft ground. Fill in i round the roots with top soil, tramping it down as the hole is be - nn filled, making sure that the soil is firmly packed and brought up (o the proper level. As soon as the trees are set, the same day if possible, the branches should be cut back and all broken and bruised bs removed. From this time on whether you are to have a profit - e orchard or not depends entirely upon the care you give it. The better the care the more profit you may reasonably expect. Wrappers or protectors should be placed upon the trees soon after ng set in protect them from rabbits and field mice. This item i.s v important and should not be neglected, or many of the trees will pped of their bark and destroyed. Cultivation should be commenced as soon as the weeds start and d be often enough to keep the tree rows free from weeds until indillf to (he last of July. This cultivation should be kept up year until the trees begin to show fruit, when the middles should wn to red clover, which may be cut from time to time and left ground as a mulch l'runing should be done each spring, taking care to thin out the and shape the trees so that heavy cutting may be avoided grows older and conies into bearing. During the time of cultivation and pruning and before the tree s into bearing, we recommend the planting of corn between the rows, which seems to do the trees no harm and brings some returns from the land that otherwise would be wasted. We have found from actual experience that orchards grown and handled in this way are profitable ones, providing of course that such an orchard after it begins to show fruit is handled with the same timely care and intelligence that has been used up to this time. The process of pruning, spraying, cultivation, picking and pack - ing and the manner of distribution and marketing is so important that they all have a bearing on the final outcome and must be taken into consideration. However, time will not permit me to take them up. although they are matters of vital importance and I trust that they will be discussed by others in these meetings. Now as to the profits in apple growing. Your secretary told me that he wanted me to give you something inspirational, something </seg>

In 1895 I set a commercial orchard of twenty acres, about half 'inesaps and half Ben Davis and Gano, with a few Jonathans. These ees were mostly one year old and were handled as indicated in the rst part of this paper. I do not remember just what year I got my rst paying crop, as I kept no accurate record, but I do remember hat the only year that we failed to get a fair crop of apples after ley came into bearing was in 1908. Many of you will remember that e had a heavy frost that spring which killed the buds and there was o fruit at all. But with the exception of this year I do not think here was a single year that the orchard of twenty acres did not eturn more net profit than all the rest of the farm of one hundred and orty acres of good land. In fact, this orchard paid so well that I most lost interest in the balance of the farm and considered it a de issue. It is no uncommon thing to net $100.00 per acre in ordi - ary years, and when the good crops come along, every other year &gt;r so, $200.00 or better. The same year, 1895, A. M. Shubert set a I wen acre orchard of practically the same varieties on a lfiO-acre farm oi mile from mine, and during most of this time these lands haw »&gt;••. rented with the exception of the orchard, which we reserve and hand ourselves. His experience has been very much the same as mine. have heard him say many times that the profits from that twen acres of orchard was greater than all the grain land on the place. In 1908 Mr. A. M. Shubert and myself bought an eighty Mm f land near Shubert, upon which was forty acres of hearing orchard hat had been badly handled, and the owner had new-r FMttvai much ncome from it. He naturally became disgusted with it and we were ortunate enough to buy it for $13,000.00. Many of the wise outs miled and said that we paid too much, but we went to work cleaning up, pruning and spraying, and the very first year it loaded up. and n four years we received enough net profit to pay for the land and nough more to pay operating expenses. Since then we have taken nough profit out of that orchard to pay for anothr eighty acres of and near it, and to pay for setting the other forty to young trees nd taking care of them. In the summer of 1916 I bought another orchard of forty acres of bearing trees, the crop going in on the deal. The crop being very - light that year I netted only about $2,000.00, but in 1917 it loaded up and that fall it was a sight to see. Several of you men here saw that crop of apples and know that my profits that year were moi - than enough to pay for the entire cost of the land, and since that </seg>

J. Weaver of Falls City, and many others if profits in apple growing that we should not forget is ilue of lands planted to orchards. Let me give you xanif Mr. Allen Franklin, one of our large orchard owners near Shu - has a farm of one hundred and twenty acres. Seventy acres of land is in bearing trees, all good varieties, set in 1900 and 1901. tart of December Mr. Franklin came into our bank and wanted to price his farm in this manner: he asked the land, amounting to $30,000.00 for the 120 then he wanted the buyer to pay him for twenty-four hundred t the rate of $12.50 per tree, making another $30,000.00, or pi-ie.. lor the farm of $80,ihhi.imi. which would make an aver- p'T acre of $500.00 by this that Mr. Franklin valued the trees at more w an he did the land. Considering that Mr. Franklin re- &gt;ss about $24,000.00 for his 1919 apple crop, it would seem perhaps was a very reasonable price. Many orchards in the western country are being valued at $1,000 I.'iimi per acre and even more. Which would seem high to us. (insider that well cared for orchards in the Missouri tuning an income of $150 to $200 per acre, it lat even this high price is not unreasonable. )own in Kichard.son county I know a man that received a gross $20,000 from a 40-acre orchard in 1917. Another man in county packed 5,000 barrels from a 40-acre orchard. I know another man that only a few years ago was broke. Today he is out of debt and living on easy street from his profits in apple grow ing. In all my wide acquaintance among apple men, that have en - gaged in commercial apple growing, I do not know of a single failure, while I know of many who have grown fat and wealthy and are able to ride in big automobiles and spend their leisure time in Florida or California or in politics. The future in apple growing looks bright to me as the past has been. I see no reason why we cannot continue to take satisfactory profits from well kept orchards in Nebraska. The final question re - garding profitable commercial fruit growing is quantity and quality od enough to attract attention </seg>

A urea! majority of these trees have been planted more None of the orchards show a perfect stand of trees ■nd in many cases there are less than a dozen thrifty trees per acre. While quite a number of the orchards contain thrifty trees, which bear of good size and quality, other orchards are weakened by dis - and produce fruit of inferior size and quality. There has been try little planting since 1900 and most of the orchards that have » en put out were planted since 1915. We have records of over 800 orchard recently planted but yet too young to come into There has been an exceptionally strong demand, at good prices, Nebraska apples during the last five years. Most of the fruit has fen sold to Nebraska buyers. No doubt the older orchards will con - imie io bear up to the time and perhaps a few years following the when the young orchards come into bearing. The acreage of : orchards is however inadequate to supply Nebraska's demand Nebraska apples The extraordinary raise in land values should not discourage ting. The present deflated market for grain should not neces- y discourage planting of orchards. It will be interesting to note apple prices have remained fairly constant. Apples of good are commanding as good or better prices today as we were of ast fall at harvest time. li is customary in eastern Nebraska to grow corn on the land in ewly planted orchards. Where these orchards have been planted on iricultural land, the corn crop for the past season is yielding about fifty bushels to the acre. The price offered for new corn has been about fifty cents a bushel. Most corn land in eastern Nebraska ren»s for half delivered. The twenty-five bushels per acre would give the owner, at fifty cents per bushel, twelve dollars and fifty cents per acre gross. Deducting three dollars per acre for interest and upkeep we would still gel nine dollars per acre or three per cent on a valua - tion of three hundred dollar land. It has been proven by years of experience that the orchards begin to bear paying crops at ten years of age, that are capable of producing an average of twenty-five to fifty per cent on the investment in its period of 10 to 15 years. Often orchards will average 100 per cent on the investment during the period of 15 to 20 years. </seg>

After the trees are heeled iii and varieties properly labeled, the soil should be thoroughly satu - rated with water. It is advisable to leave the trees stand heeled in but kept soaked with water for at least a week before planting. Preparation of the Moil and I'laminu. The general preparation of the soil for planting an orchard should &gt;egin in many cases a few years before the orchard is planted. The and should be free from weeds and the soil in a high state of tilth. The ground should be thoroughly disked early in the spring and kept isked or harrowed to retain plenty of moisture before the young rees are planted out. The rows can be marked off by the use of a earn and lister running a shallow furrow. The first two rows planted hould be measured carefully and the trees set at exactly right angles o one another. The writer is of the opinion, though, that it is best to lake the proposed ground and then use a planting board in setting ut the trees. There is a great satisfaction in getting the Irae rows bsolutely straight and I believe it worth while. When planting the trees the long sprangly roots should be sh ened back, the broken roots should be cut out and it is a good pra( o trim the ends of roots with a sharp knife so that they will cal and start rootlets as soon as possible alter planting. Do as little pruning as possible to enable a good job of planting in a hole nches in diameter.

Baked apples are good for little children v hose stomachs are not yet accustomed to solid food. They are equally as good for the dyspeptic, the invalid or the sluggard. While apples do not contain as much food value as many of the vegetables, the acid of the apple apparently has a regulating effect on the human svstein.

Plant cherry and plum fillers in the rows running north and south. The Windbreak. The windbreak should be planted when the orchard is started and it would be an advantage if the windbreak were planted three to five years before the orchard is set out. Arrange the rows of pine trees so that they can be cultivated. Yearly applications of barnyard manure will make a wonderful growth on pine trees in almost any section of Nebraska. The grower should plan to cultivate the orchard and grow garden crops or small fruit in the same. Barnyard manure is also good for the apple trees and especially valuable for cherries and plums. It can be applied in the spring or fall when the farmer usually cleans out the barnyard and lots. </seg>

If the proper care and pains are taken in planting the home orchard, surrounding it with a pine tree windbreak, adding barnyard manure, giving it the necessary cultivation, properly pruning and spraying, you cannot keep the orchard from bearing at least three very five years after it is ten years of age. Kruit Trop Report Reports on the condition of fruit have been received from most f the river counties, where the largest per cent of the commercial rchards and fruit plantations are located in Nebraska. Reports in- dicate that strawberries and cane fruits were not seriously injured by April freezes, so that the home grown berry crops will probably give a normal yield. Early cherries are practically all killed in the South Platte country, late cherries will have a light crop. While many varieties of grapes have been injured, growers and experiment station experts seem to agree that the Concord and other hardy varieties will produce a good crop. Plums, peaches, pears and apricots will be almost a total failure in most parts of Nebraska. The apple crop, which has been the main feature for the fruit crop in Nebraska, can be summed up about as follows: Richardson, Pawnee, Johnson and Nemaha counties, very light, almost a failure. The orchards of Otoe and Cass counties will have 30 to 40 per cent of a normal crop.

In all cases where dusting has been tried, it has given good control of codling moth and other insects, fully as good as spraying. However, results in the control of fungus pests have not been so consistent. In the Michigan experiments, scab was con - trolled fully as well by dusting as by spraying. In this case sulphur dust was the fungicide. The Virginia experiments showed that Bor - deaux dust controlled both scab and blotch, but was absolutely no good in controlling bitter rot.

It is hoped that dusting will b perfected by that time to control scab and blotch as well as do present method. I'ntil that is the case, however, it is well for th growers to stay with the system which has giY«a them good result and let the experiment stations continue trying the dust. In the of the satisfactory results everywhere in the control of insect dusting with lead arsenate, it would be safe to supplement the liquid sprays with the dust for the control of codling moth, but that wou their effectiveness in the past that they are reliable materials in th control of scab, phylostica blotch and sooty blotch when used at th right time and in the right manner.

The conclusions based on ih results secured, are that lead arsenate is at present UM best an safest poison to use. It makes no difference whether th&gt;- pasi' or the powdered form is used. Calcium arsenate and zinc arsenal have given good control but they have injured the Foliage and fru in most cases. Magnesium arsenate in most cases caused injury an likewise failed to measure up to had arsenatf in tin control of it sects.

(From the Fifty-first Annual Report of the Nebraska State Hort cultural Society p , 1921.) No doubt, you are all familiar with the outstanding results ob - tained by the medical men within recent years in the prevention of some of the ills which have cursed mankind for ages, in fact, some of the most dreaded scourges of the past have almost disappeared anil are little heard of today. Unfortunately we still have other diseases which can still develop into epidemics or even pandemics and will continue to do so until medical science devises ways and means oi conquering them. Many of these plagues of the past have been mas - tered by following the fundamental laws of sanitation, the most im - portant of which is the elimination of the source of disease, in other words, prevention. Of course, the man interested in diseases ai plants knows full well that he cannot use vaccines, serums, etc., which «! have been used so successfully in human and animal pa controlling diseases of plants, but he can attempt tin- elii the source of plant diseases, through efficient sanitation. The reason why you have diseases in your orchards from year to year is solely due to the fact that you have not eliminated the source. Through spraying you can control diseases like scab and blotch during the growing season and prevent them from developing into epidemics, but you must combat these pests year in and year out. Why not take the most difficult course, but the easiest in the long run and eliminate all serious diseases from your orchards which can - not be controlled by spraying such as blister canker, cedar rust, and fire blight. In practice, this is a most difficult procedure, in that we must have the concerted action on the part of many individuals to carry out such an ambitious program. One individual may elimi - nate a disease from his orchard, but if his neighbor does not do like - wiBe, it will be of little value, as the winds, insects, etc., will carry the germs of disease back into his orchard as in the case of fire blight. Again, if a number of growers clean up their orchards and fail to take notice of the diseased trees growing in the vicinity, they will nave still a source of disease, which will menace their orchards. Orchard diseases are propagated by spores or germs which either passed the winter in the trees themselves or in the neighborhood. Every grower should take it upon himself to cull out his diseased </seg>
            <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 109 ■ r I rees, prune out diseased twigs and eliminate all refuse which might tarbor the disease spores. Of course, this is a rather tedious job in- that will pay in the long run. By all means, the abandoned id neglected orchards should be destroyed as each orchard of this pe serves as a breeding ground and center for the spread of insect .1 mid fungus pest commonly occurring in orchards. The grower has two thoughts in mind in managing an orchard; ly, high yields and quality, as a combination of the two brings iim the best returns from the market. Then why not take as great jrecautionary measures as the man who, let us say, raises fancy ani- li a stock man has an attack of contagious or infectious dis - &lt;&gt;im his cattle, he is sure to isolate or kill the diseased ani- mals as soon as the disease is noticed. How much more quickly Iocs he act than the orchardist, who will neglect to cut out diseased n his grov I do not think that the grower has ever appreciated the value and ength of life of his trees as compared, say with a good produc - ■ow. Alter the difference in labor cost is subtracted, I think he nill find that when the length of life of his trees is considered, that a ii i tli producing tree will yield as good a return as a good producing » Thus, I would urge the growers here present to keep their ifils as free from diseases as is humanely possible, through the nation and prevention of the source and centers of disease which nenace to successful orchard production. It is not sufficient that you maintain efficient sanitation in your hards, but you must also look to the general health and thriftiness trees themselves. In fact, you must go still further and not row healthy trees but trees that produce and yield returns. You must also bear in mind that the native fruit trees growing where competition is keen can maintain themselves in health to a much better advantage than the highly specialized, grafted or burred vari- eties which you raise in your orchards. Through breeding, selecting, and culling, new varieties embodying more desirable features of high yields and quality are being originated, until perhaps we may reach a point where we will destroy the internal equilibrium of the trees ;,nd make them more susceptible to disease. Plants are much more susceptible to disease thai animals. This should be expected owing to their decidedly difference in make up. The chief differences of course, occur in the absence of blood circula - tion and its efficient properties in combatting diseases, once infection takes place in animals. Thus, plants are not only more susceptible to disease than animals, but their recovery is less certain if the disease is allowed to go unchecked. A good example is blister canker of </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT apples. Once a tree becomes diseased and is allowed to go un - checked, the tree finally succumbs. Growth of fruit trees like other plants may be considered as the function of two variables. The first of these is the genetic constitu- En of the individual. The second is the resultant of those factors t make up what is commonly called environment. The first vari - e namely, the genetic constitution of the individual can be con - trolled more or less by the plant breeder through the selection, breed - ing and culling out of undesirable varieties and the j roduction of new varieties embodying all the desirable features that go to make up a good individual. On the other hand, the growers can do little to control the ex - ternal factors, commonly called environment. Environment includes factors, such as temperature, moisture, light, nutrition, etc. I think that you will all admit that the biggest gamble in orchard growing is the uncertainty of the weather in season and out of season. Favor - able weather during rather short intervals during the year determine to a large extent whether you will have a good crop. Again, other weather conditions determine wti your orchards. ther diseases will be p t these &lt;-iind How is the grower Ratag to n has no control?

Third, varieties nui: which will maintain themselves in health and vigor urder tions. After these conditions have been fulfilled, thro sense orchard management, the trees must be kept it iiltli and vigor so that they will produce bountiful crops. Thus, while the grower has no control over external factors, he can by the choice of location study of local weather conditions, selection of desirable varieties and common sense management, so adjust his trees to these uncontrollable factors that he can maintain them in health and vigor and so obtain maximum production under these conditions. It is not in my providt nee to tell you how to locate an orchard site nor what constitutes proper orchard management. However, with my four years experience in Alabama still fresh in my mind. I know that too much care cannot be given to the proper location of an orchard site. I have also observed that good orchard management brought many of the Satsuma orange trees thru the severe winters of 1916-17, and 1917-18, while total losses were sustained by growers in the same vicinity, who failed to look after their trees intelligently. </seg>

I know you would be inclined to use 3ome pretty strong adjectives in telling what you thought of him. And si ill isn't this what a lot of growers do? Perhaps they don't go i to take the lowest offer, but what do they know about the y are getting? When a dairyman buys a cow, he wants to now all about her father and mother, yes, ever her grandfather and randmother, and then some. In fact, he is not satisfied as to her tors, but the cow must be sound herself and be tested for tuber - is, etc.. before she is accepted. Why shouldn't an orchard grower ake the same demands on the nurserymen, both for pedigree and sease free stock? He can, but not until he is willing a pay a iuni for such stock, the same as the dairyman does. I really believe that the relative low cost of nursery stock has ded fruit industry in this country more than it has been stimu- ted. Quantity production in nurseries, such as is going on today, )t only means less dependable trees of questionable origin, but trees rown under conditions which invite diseases. You are all familiar ith the old saying "It isn't the original cost but the upkeep." Low A ced trees means a larger acreage at the beginning, which is usually lowed in a few years by a high percentage of neglected orchards, 1 eventually a small acreage of bearing trees. I have seen acres peach orchards rooted out at 3 and 5 years old, just when they d be producing at their maximum, because the stock was origin- nfected with crown gall and nematodes when :t came from the ry. In other words, it costs just as much to bring a poor tree aring as a high grade one. Then why not add to the original t good high producing varieties free from disease to sta A Why not do as the dairyman does, by going to the nursery your- and selecting strong, vigorous stock of varieties well adapted to our local conditions and resistant to the more prevalent diseases in our locality, budded or grafted with buds or scions taken from high producing trees? At the same time, you can demand a guarantee that the stock you select is free from diseases such as crown gall. As is the case of the dairyman, you should be willing to pay a premium for such stock. So long as the growers demand cheap trees, the nursery - men will furnish these to him, but once the nurseryman is convinced that the growers demand high quality trees, then he will change his methods. Once a beginning is made through the use of good high grade trees, these trees must be kept in good health, for a healthy vigorous tree is more resistant to disease. For example, the fungus causing blister canker cannot attack a perfectly healthy tree, but enters only </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT through wounds. However, once an entrance is made, it is almost 1 possible to control. I have gone on at more length than I should, but I do want ti instill into your minds that spraying alone will not prevent all th diseases in your orchards. As the medical men are (jelling away fro'i the idea of giving ill-smelling medicines for every ache and pain, O the growers must realize that spraying is not a cure-all. Many grow ers have a mistaken notion thai If they can produce clean, market able fruit through spraying, that their trees necessarily nuisi k healthy and live and bear fruit indefinitely. Please do not misunderstand me. Spraying is absolutely tial to successful orchard management under present conditions, and should be included in the sanitation and hygiene program. I should like to have you take home the doctrine of sanitation and hygiene and in combination with an efficient spraying schedule put it into practice in your orchards. Be ever on the watch for the sources and center of diseases and eliminate them immediately. The elimination and pre - vention of disease cannot be accomplished over night, but will take years. Thus, it is important that you choose those varieties best adapted to your locality, and keep these trees in health and rigor, tot a vigorous tree is much MM resistant to plant diseases in mind that your trees are just as valuable as good ai they are vital, living things, and should In taken can I should like to devote the rest of m&gt; paper r portant diseases of apples in Nebraska, and try t where a combination program of spraying, sanii will in time reduce lo a minimum theoe &lt;lise;i- Of the five diseases which are mloil in Nebraska. scab and blotch, can be readily controlled by spraying ■ three; namely, blister canker, cedar rust, and fire blip efficiently controlled and must be attacked from the stan vention.

Usually the injury to the fruits is considered the most serious aspect of the disease, although the ef - ficiency of the foliage is markedly reduced, so a less efficient and vig - orous tree is the indirect result, which in the long run is an important phase of the disease. Usually the fungus winters over in the old infected leaves on the ground. During periods of rainy weather in the spring, the spores of the perfect stage mature, are forcibly discharged, and carried to the leaves on the lower branches of the trees. Primary infection of the young leaves usually occurs during the month of May, depending on </seg>

At any rate, a beginning can be made through destruction of the neglected and abandoned trees in your vicinity. The efforts of the grower should be concentrated to prevent as M possible, primary infection. This can be done to some extent spraying just before a rainy period sets in at about the time of the st. -i -cup stage. If this spray can be applied just at the right time h year, you will prevent to some extent, primary infection from tak- place and consequently reduce secondary infection to a minimum, pontinuing the procedure, each year you will gradually eliminate Every disease has a weak link in its life cycle and it is at this hat you must continually attack if you are going to eliminate HMt, Please bear in mind, then, that the spores of 'he fungus re discharged only during rainy periods in the spring and the first pray must anticipate this period to prevent as far as possible, primary on.

Therefore, concentrate most of your efforts at this lotch: Scab is a disease primarily destructive in the north, blotch is especially severe in the south; in fact, it is the most hit disease of apples to control under southern conditions. With - nt years blotch has gradually advanced northward, until it is &gt;w quite prevalent in Nebraska. Blotch occurs on the fruit, twig, leaves and at times on the older - in the form of scaly bands on the bark. As in the case of scab, the most serious damage is on the fruit, but unlike scab, the spots tormed on the leaves do not materially reduce the efficiency of the folia The fungus winters over in the cankers on the twigs. Unlike scab, the spores do not mature and infect until two to six weeks after the petals fall, so that primary infection in this case occurs much later than with scab. As the fungus of this disease is carried through the winter year after year in the old cankers on the twigs, the prevention and elimina- </seg>
            <seg id="p114">FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT 114 lion of twig cankers is imperative if you are going to control this dii ease. Here again, sanitation and general health of the trees must t considered. To prevent blotch in the first place, it is necessary to spray the trees from the time they are set in the orchard. Where blotch is present in the orchard a spray (usually about 3 weeks aft the petals drop) will anticipate primary infection, as is the case scab. Sprays applied at the right times will have accumulative effect Each grower should make it a point to study the weather and its effect not only on his trees but on the appearance and subsequent de- velopment of the disease he must contend with. Thus, he should note each season the first appearance of the diseases in question, the gen eral condition of his trees, and the weather conditions prevailing bt fere primary infection appears. Alter several years of observations he can then apply his sprays at times when they will have the grea efficiency in controlling these disease Blister Canker: -Blister canker is the most serious, meanest, insidious disease which the apple growers in Nebraska must cot with, especially to those who have old orchards of Ben Davis, or C The symptoms of this disease varies with varieties, ape of the t available water and soil nutrients, and weather conditions.

Thus, under Nebraska conditions, where blister canker is so serious, he must plant strong vigorous trees of varieties which are resistant to this disease. Th second step is to prune and train his trees while young, so that h will avoid making large wounds when the trees become older, at which time they are more susceptible. Proper pruning is one of thf first fundamentals of orchard management and under no circumstances should it be done by inexperienced hands. Not only must pruning in can tak&gt;' pla&lt; jns are favorablt-. which niaki' uj disease. Thus </seg>

Thus, under no circumstances should pruning be lone during the summer when the disease is very active and infection lakes place easily. All pruning wounds made on wood more than a icar old should be disinfected and covered by some good dressing. It is well known that susceptibility of apple trees to blister canker is greatly influenced by the general health and vigor of the trees, water supply and soil nutrients available, and by the season of the year in which infection takes place. All trees which make less than a normal growth are susceptible, be it due to lack of water, undernourish - ment or what not. On the other hand, trees making a strong, vigorous growth throughout the year but especially during early spring and sum - mer are much more resistant. Thus, look well to the sanitation and lygiene of your orchards if you wish to keep blister canker out, as ince blister canker makes its appearance, it is practically impossible iminate For those who have this serious disease in their orchards the pre - ention ol the dissemination of the spores to healthy trees is the first siep. Thus, all trees badly diseased should be cut out and burned. The same thing should be done with diseased limbs and branches. Whenever the cankers appear in the nail head stage or even before ey should be scraped and burned and the wound painted with a good sinlectant and dressing. Finally, keep your trees in an infected chard in as vigorous a growing condition as possible. Apple rust: — In apple, or cedar rust we have a disease whicn ■ie.-ds two hosts for the development of its lite cycle. In the absence of one host the disease must necessarily die out. Thus, both the cedar md apple are necessary hosts for the development of thia peculiar fungus. )n the apple, leaves, fruit and occasionally twigs are attacked by rust. However, before the disease can develop on the apple in the spring, the spore balls on the cedar must swell up during periods of rainy weather and discharge the spores. These develop secondary spores which in turn are carried by the wind to the apple trees. Only primary infection on the apple is possible as the spores formed on the leaves and fruit cannot reinfect the apple but must go to the cedar to complete its life cycle. The seriousness of cedar rust on apples in the spring depends primarily on weather conditions. Thus a wet spring usually means more apple rust. The logical way to combat this trouble in your orchards is again through the elimination of the source of the disease which in this casn means the destruction of all cedars within from one-half to one mile of your orchards. This should not be a difficult task in Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Fire blight: — I hesitate to discuss this trouble with you, for no doubt, you have heard the same story many times before. Inmr, let us take it up from a sanitation and hygiene standpoint and see it we cannot throw some new light on the subject. You are all familiar with the various types of fire blight, commonly known as "blossom blight," "twig blight," and "canker blight," depending on the part of the tree attacked. The bacteria causing this disease overwinters in a few live cank - ers on the branches and trunk of the trees. With the first sign oi activity on the part of the trees in the spring, the bacteria become* active also and soon exude in large numbers in the form of sticky drops from the cankers at or just prior to blossoming nun-. Tins - sticky drops are visited by bees and other insectB, which in turn K" to the apple blossoms and so the vicious circle of blight is started tor another season as blossom blight is followed by spur blight, etc. Note that bad blight years depend on an entirely different m weather conditions than scab or rust. Weather conditions w cause the most rapid and active growth of the trees in early sprint: conducive to blight, while extremely unfavorable to the developi of scab and rust. Thus, in seasons when blight is bud yon will 1 less scab and rust and vice versa The first step in the prevention of fire blight the case of blister canker, the planting of varieti. -s i ease. The next step is to grow your trees in su avoid, as far as possible, the production of suckers w or any rapidly growing shoots. Where th pruned out. Cankers are generally started li&gt; infected iwi. nature when the disease goes down the twig to the branch or trunl the tree. Just recently it has been found that collar blight near crown of the trees is started by infected sprouts. Thus, every ef should be put forth to prevent the formation of any body cank Once formed these must be searched for and cut out. While some localities on the west coast have been successful in preventing blight by hiring inspectors whose sole duty it was to con - stantly patrol the pear orchards and cut out any blight as soon as it was detected, such a procedure would not be practical in Nebraska. However, by preventing "hold over" cankers and cutting these out when detected, a measure of control can be accomplished, especially when combined with resistant varieties. In conclusion I should like to submit for your close study and criticism, the following table prepared with the assistance of Professors Howard and Hoppert, of the Department of Horticulture.

The Society has received considerable inquiry in regard to the use of Dry Lime Sulphur. The writer has had three years experience and could not recommend the Dry Lime Sulphur as being a dependable spray. On some varieties and in some orchards Dry Lime Sulphur seemed to give good results but at the same time, the Dry Lime Sul - phur did not control scab. For those who are so situated and equip - ped, the writer would recommend trial use of Dry Lime Sulphur. If the manufacturers continue to perfect this product it, no doubt, will take the place of liquid Lime Sulphur. It is more convenient to use, but no iirchardist can afford to use his entire orchard experimenting with a product which is not absolutely dependable. Lime Sulphur, dry or liquid, will not control blotch, and varieties which are subject to apple blotch must be sprayed with Bordeaux </seg>

On the wall the home of the long forgotten cave dweller of Colorado and Arizona painted pictures of animals and of hunting scenes, which to htin his family were no doubt beautiful and attractive.

The wearing of the "Leisa," a garland or necklace of flowers worn about the neck, is, or was, a universal custom with them. The Chinese, perhaps, have more reverence or respect for flowers than any other nation, with the possible exception of the Japanese. The Sacred Lily, which may be seen growing in a bowl of pebbles and water in any Chinese home, or shop, or laundry, is not considered by its owner in the same light as is the geranium in your or your neigh - bor's window, but is looked upon more as is the crucifix which hangs upon the wall of the home of the devout Catholic — a divine symbol.

A farmer beautifies his home grounds because he is proud of home and loves beauty, and because he is considering his family, v tors and passersby. The farmer's wife is quite a factor to the succ of the farm, yet does she get repaid for her efforts as much as city dweller's wife in like circumstances? A few farmers it is t present their wives with tokens of appreciation, take them to a or other amusement once in a while, but forget the place whert spends most of her life. I believe a canary bird would sing bette placed among shrubbery and trees instead of placed out in a bar desert. A good many farmers go to town oftener than their wi and get to see different scenes and the wife is at home enjoyini self with the churn or something and has to look at the unkept that he is too busy to keep up. It is true that farmers have been b (and don't you think they always will be?) but not too busy to k the place looking like they were proud of home.

Don't you dislike to pa » ways has a grouchy look on his face? Well, anyway to see such a face. The same is true of the depr w home grounds. How much better it is to have a sn yard. One farmer told me: I am not in a position to take my w a theater and she loves flowers so well I want the place fixed up. other said: I'd rather put the money into landscaping tha diamond ring. Another said: The children have been good work and I'll fix the place up for them as well as the old woman. A many farmers are trying to make home more inviting dren to keep them on the farm. Children are always gran kind of improvement. We all remember the trees and flowers nn old home place. We should strive to make a life, instead of ju living.

This suggestion as to size of a yard is only for the farmer who abso - utely wants a small one, for in many cases they should be larger, 'he main entrance into the yard should be arranged so that it is con - enient to use. In a good many cases a farmer takes you into the ome by a roundabout way, through the front gate out by the road r through the back gate to the kitchen. Sufficient trees should be planted tor shade, for background, to rame the house, screen bad views, etc. Some people use too many hade trees in their front yard. It would be better tj use ornamental rees instead. The lawn should have a border of shrubbery to frame t and give it a background, either by using an ornamental hedge or iirubbeiy grouping. The method of planting shrubs out in the lawn spoils the effect of the lawn. To illustrate what I mean by planting shrubs in groups, would bay, that no doubt you have noticed the wild sumac or other shrubs or flowers in groups by the road side, several growing close and massing together. If one of these were standing alone they would not be as pretty. Practically any of the shrubs and plants are more attractive when planted in groups as the Divine Archi - ect plants them. The size of the groups we place depends upon the character of the shrub and its use in the planting. Also when planted close together and planted at the border of the lawn, the shrubbery frames the lawn or gives it a background.

What I shall say will be largely the result of my experience, though of course, 1 have gleaned very valuable informa - tion from the magazines and periodicals that treat upon this subject. There is no reason why people living in eastern Nebraska, who care lor flowers, should not enjoy (lowers of some sort from April to No - vember, or nearly two-thirds of • -very fmmr. 1 am speaking now, ot course, of flowers that may be grown out of doors. I shall not at - tempt to say much about the beauty or the elegance of the various flowers, because I consider this subject quite exhausted by the poets. Flowers, some one has said, are the most beautiful things that Cod ever made that lie didn't put a soul into, and I am sometimes almo;: and when the last call is sounded to our dear on tmpatliy is extended with flowers, so that under most ordinary instances we find the pathway of the average person more or strewn with flowers from the cradle to the grav The poets from the earliest times have sung of flowers.

The flowers we look forward to with most enthusiasm are those we commonly refer to as the spring flowers, such as tulips, daffodils and narcissus; the tulips are of a number of varieties, and by proper selection a person may enjoy this gorgeous flower from early in April until about the last of May. This may be done by planting for very early blooming the single early tulips. These may be had in all col- By I/. W.

Second, what is usually called Dragon tulips, may be planted and these will bloom In' time ?li»- early tulips have disappeared. About the time sap pear the Darwin tulips will come on and they are one of &gt;si satisfactory (lowers grown in our country; they grow to a of two or three feet and are often as large as an ordinary nnbler. and may be had in all colors desired. Along with the tulips come the daffodils, and they may be had gratl variety and ranging in size from the smallest of the type own as the Jonquil, to the larger ones known as Emperor. These wers are, of course, produced from bulbs planted in the fall; the planting requires no particular skill and no further attention after the flowers have come and gone. The bulbs in the fall muld be planted about four inches deep, depending somewhat of &gt;u lsc on the size of the bulb. A good rule, and an easy one to re- plant all bulbs and seeds four times their thickness in ii pth. If the tulip bulbs average about an inch in thickness they ould bt- planted four inches deep, and this rule should be strictly [tdhered to in planting the finest of seeds; some of them are almost liki- snuff, and in such cases they should be scattered on top of well pulverized soil and tamped slightly with a rake and kept moist and I'd with burlap or some such material until the seeds have inated and obtained a root hold. Another of the very desirable of the spring flowers is Narcissus; times the daffodils are called Narcissus. Narcissus is sort of a family name and covers a large range of flowers, but of the many varieties I have found the Poet's Narcissus to be one of the most satisfactory, and it is not only a beautiful flower but very fragrant. These spring flowers I have spoken of have very few insect enemies and seem to endure the changes of our climate, often withstanding heavy freeze when in bud, and once planted and established there is nothing, short of destruction, that will prevent their blooming; but of course it is always important to remember that good care and t'trtilization will add wonderfully to the size and splendor of the bloom. After these spring flowers have bloomed, the stems and foliage will dry down and disappear early in the summer, and with the exercise of just a little care, the ground occupied by these bulbs may be used for some of the annuals of which I shall speak later. The tulip bulbs are usually good in this country for about three years, at which time they should be dug and dried from shortly after blooming time until the following October. Following the spring flowers of which I have just spoken, comes the Iris. Please do not confuse Iris with the old fashioned flags; it isn't fair to the Iris and suggests memories of failures.

Iris, in many respects, approaches the orchid in beauty, and is sometimes called the poor man's orchid, and like the tulip and narcissus has no insect enemies, but does not withstand heavy rain storms or hail as well as the other flowers, as the bloom is of exceed- ingly fine texture. I think they will come as near growing undei adverse conditions as any flower known to our country; ther reason why every household should not have Iris along its walks fences, or just any out of the way place where it will get a fair at sunshine, and of course weeds kept down so they will not crowd Wi out the plants.

I tind people looking over my garden fence at the Oriental Poppies that would not stop for anything else in the garden. This flower may be grown from seed, but it requires about two years to get a plant large enough to put out. The most satisfactory way is to buy the roots. After they have been once established they are practically indestructible, and in addition to having very attractive blooms, the foliage is beautiful. After they have bloomed and the seed pods are lormed and matured, the whole bush or plant will die down and, to inexperienced, might appear to have died forever, but when the rains come on they take second growth before freezing weather. Of the other perennials I might mention Delphinium or Hardy Lark Spur. Those who care for blue flowers should not overlook Delphinium. There is also a white Delphinium now grown, but the popular Delphinium is the dark blue and light blue. Before passing the perennials I want also to mention lilies. There Hit' many kinds of lilies that are easily grown. Of course, you are all familiar with the old time Tiger Lily, and you know it grew under most any condition. The later developments in lilies are perhaps not iliiiic so indestructible as the Tiger Lily but they are regarded as being perfectly hardy and many of them of exceedingly rare beauty. I have ■ NpiTimcnit-d a little the last three or four years with lilies, and have had results that are really surprising to myself. I can not name all nf the varieties that I have, and am really sorry that I can not give you the name of one or two of the larger types I have; but I do re- call the name of one, I think it is usually called Lilium Auratum. or (iolden Banded Lily of Japan. All of these lilies are Japanese im - portations, and should you try any of them ever don't be surprised if you find some of them lying in the ground two years before they /(inn- up. One of the very largest is the Melponeme. This lily is a wonder and I think it is one of those that loaf about two years be - fore coming out, but the wait is well worth while. All of these are crown from bulbs which should be planted in the fall, and it is often wry late before we can get them from Japan, and should you ever care to grow any of the Japanese lilies I would suggest that you cover the ground where you desire to plant them heavy with straw or some such material to prevent freezing, and plant the bulbs as soon as they can be had. I have found the bulbs are often so late in ar - riving that some such method must be followed to prevent freezing before the bulbs arrive. They should be fertilized heavily, and aside from this require little attention, except keeping out the coarse weeds. But like any other flower or plant will do better if in addition to keeping out all of the weeds will keep the ground stirred around the stems, but do not become too eager to cultivate the lily bed in the </seg>

There are many other flowt among the perennials that are enjoyed by many people, such as hollyhock and many others of which I have not spoken. Personally I do not think the hollyhock should be classed as a flower. I thin* it is a pest. I would like, however, to mention one more perenni; and that is the Gypsophlia, commonly called Baby Breath. This also grown as an annual, hut is not quite as graceful or as useiul the perennials. Ciypgnphlia is particularly useful with sweet peas nasturtiums, roses and many other of the smaller flowers, and w 1 mention the perennials I would not have you torget the annua they are both vet &gt; &lt;|.-siral&gt;le.

I think the best results are ob A planting it early so that the bulk of the bloom will come June or the first half of July. I have met disaster a time wo when they began blooming about the first week in August ■ we would have a little touch of hot winds. Now, then, for the annuals. There are many annuals and I have xperiinented with practically all I have read about, but I shall not iienipt to tell you of any of my failures but rather of those I have u a measure successful in growing. One of the first and I &gt;ne of the most successful flowers grown in the home garden Nasturtium. Not much is required in the way of soil for the rowing of nasturtiums; they will thrive in thin, clayey soil as well s in a heavier, black soil. Perhaps the best fertilizer for nasturtiums would be the application of leaves from a lawn, as they seem to prefer a I i nil soil. I have always been partial to the tall varieties; they m from early in the spring until frost, so of course require culti- in enough to keep down the weeds and the soil loose enough to i In moisture. Nasturtiums has a wonderful comeback. A few I drought and they look like they are just about finished; a little W or a hose shower and they will start to bloom again as though had happened \ noi h«i- nt i he good annuals is the Aster. Most every one is iar with this flower and with different varieties of it. This is ower I usually plant over the tulips, daffodils and narcissus, as little plants are just about right to set out about the time the ps, daffodils and narcissus have died down, or if not quite dead, asters can be planted between the rows of the tulips, etc., and lat way care can be taken not to disturb the bulbs. Another good annual is the Snapdragon. This is one of the an- nuals that has the snuff-like seed. I have not experienced any trouble in getting the seed to germinate, but I have found that un- less given careful attention after they germinate they will dry out. After the plants have a start of two or three weeks, they are no par - ticular trouble, and they are ready to set out when they are an inch and one-half or two inches high, and begin blooming early and bloom until freezing weather in the fall. This, like many other flowers, has improved considerably in the last few years, both in size and color. Snapdragons have always been exceptionally easy to grow and are particularly desirable as cut flowers, but they have an enemy whoae name I do not know, that simply gets them all within a few hours </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT unless the gardener is close at hand properly armed with a sprayer and a spray mixture. Another good annual is the Cosmos. Most of you know this in a tall growing plant, with sort of fern like foliage, and until a few years ago was grown only in pink and white. A few years ago the crimson was introduced, and I note this year John Lewis Childs is introducing the double Cosmos. One of the real old-fashioned annuals is Corn Flower, sometimes called Bachelor Button and sometimes called Blue Bottle. This is an old favorite and in recent years has been produced in addition to the old time blue, in crimson, maroon, white and pink. It is one of the earliest bloomers and is as persistent in its growth as a weed. A very nice effect may be obtained by sowing the seed in the grass along the walk or in the parking; the flowers will mature by the time the blue grass is cut the first time. Sweet Peas are perhaps one of the most admired of all flow&lt; Ewn In the home garden. They are indeed beautiful, but are r y to grow to obtain best results, on account of the extreme he &gt;et Peas should be planted very early, as soon as the frost con out of the ground. Many people plant them in the fall; my i perience in fall planting has not been satisfactory. A good showy annual is the Zinnia; they con recently have been developed in cone shape and a variety call curled and crested. They are easy to grow and make a splent cut flower. One of the most attractive annuals growr is Sweet AlysBum. Sweet Alyssum goes well with m kind of flowers, and in addition to lending charm and beauty to ml cut flowers, is very fragrant and can be grown in many places. It usually sown along the walks, but can be used in porch noxeR, por baskets, and can be used most any place. Those who are fond of yellow flowers I would suggest planting alendula. This flower grows in several shades of yellow, and is sually one of the first of the spring flowers, following close to th" ilips and narcissus. It is very satisfactory as a cut flower and goes well with many other varieties of flowers. It is purely an annual &gt;ut the plants will come up volunteer from the seeds that shatter It from the previous year. One of the best garden flowers grown is the Pink. The Pinks grow in a variety of colors and will bloom from seed the first year, and thereafter they are of a perennial nature, and are a very dainty and exquisite flower. They bloom heaviest about the middle of June, but will bloom again in August or the first of September. </seg>

I want to mention just one more annual popularly known as Japanese Pin Cushion flower, catalogued Scabiosa. Tnis flower is now grown in six colors on stems about eighteen inches long, and for cut flowers makes one of the richest bouquets that can be grown in the home garden. It is one of the real good annuals, and after the plants are once started, easy to grow. Time will not permit me discussing all of the annuals. I wisli that I might speak to you about Portulaca, Gaillardia, Pansies, Stocks, Balsam or Lady Slipper, and a number of others. Every one wants to grow roses. They can be best grown in a row along a border. The catalogues usually speak of two \a - rieties, the Japanese and German, frequently called Queen of Flowers; they are admired by more people, probably, than any one flower, and have probably disappointed more ireople than any other one flower. Hoses are grown in numerous varieties, but for the home garden I do not advise trying many varieties. We can grow them, but rose growing is not for the amateur. It is the busi - ness of an expert. However, we all want a few ramblers and a few rose bushes. The Crimson Rambler and Dorothy Perkins have been our leading rambler for several years. The Crimson is being super- ceded somewhat by the American Beauty Rambler, a re ior beauty, larger and a better foliage. Of the bush roses, we do fairly well with a few hybrid perpetuals, such as General Jacqueminot, Paul Neyron, Frau Karl, Druscki and others, and the Killarneys, Ophelia, Hoosier Beauty and Sunburst, of the Tea ro:-' Rose growing requires constant work and vigilance; they hav»' numerous insect and other enemies, and to get results hoped for lh" grower must be on duty with spray, tobacco dust and cultivation and fertilization are features of vast importance, and after all they will all winter kill, and there are no known directions for winter care that will win every time. </seg>

(.i..-.-ail There are many things to be considered in selecting flowering shrubs, for the variety is large and almost any effect desired can be secured by a proper selection of colors. An obvious but frequently neglected precaution in arranging is to place the taller varieties in the background, and the shorter ones in front. Of course there are liable to be spots in the shrubbery border where it is desirable to have tall plants at the visible edge of the group, but in such cases plants as tall or taller should be placed behind them. Moreover, it is usually best to plant shrubbery in masses or small areas, and scat - tered groups about the lawn should be avoided. A border arrange - ment is good, using a few masses against the buildings and if lawn plants are desired, a tree may be planted in a suitable location. However, the placing of trees and shrubbery plantations is a matter that should not be attempted by the amateur without study, and it is always better to consult a landscape designer before undertaking anything more than the simplest arrangement. Planning a garden is quite as difficult a work to accomplish well, as planning a house, and while many feel capable in a small way, of designing a home, they usually do not dispense with the advice of an architect, and a landscape designer is just as necessary for the garden. The following list of shrubs may be used in central and eastern Nebraska, and have been chosen for their floral effect. The plants at the beginning of the list are designed for the back ground, while those at the end are to be placed in front, i. e., they are arranged according to size. Time of blooming is also given. White and Cream Flowered Shrubs To be most effective, plants with such light colored flowers should be placed near the house where they may be viewed from a short distance and the blooms are best brought out when massed against a background. In any case they should be left away from the sky line. PHILADELPHUS: The common name of Philadelphus is Sy - ringa or Mock Orange. These names are sometimes confusing, as Syringa is the generic name for lilac and the shrub should be spoken of as Mock Orange. P. coronarious, P. grandiflorus and P. gordoni - auus are perhaps the best varieties, but P. lemoineii cractus is also good, being six to eight feet high with a creamy white flower. As garden subjects they are valuable because of their height, their flower - ing season is June, the plants becoming a mass of white blossoms. </seg>

In these days of strenuous commercial activities we are apt in forget that some of the most important things of life are being neg - lected and overlooked. We hold the dollar so close to our eye that it obstructs our view of how to live, that is, we concentrate our thoughts strictly along the line of our business and neglect to build attractive homes by planting the things we will most admire in the reclinnm years of life. Not all of the happiness of life can be gotten from the concrete and abstract problems within the four walls which house the business we are conducting.

Trees add to the de - pment of our state and assist us in the proper appreciation of our mes and our communities.

If we w Nebraska retrospectively we find that the pioneer citizens of our le studied Nebraska's development from the standpoint of tree mint:; they commenced to make tree history in the KO's and a quar- ■ century later we found Nebraska dotted with tree plantations ry Matin of the state and many orchards were blooming aloni; ;mks of the Missouri river. For the most part trees thrived and to be useful to the people of the state. Many mistakes were jed in selecting kinds of forest trees and varieties of fruit trees nhieh would endure the climatic and soil conditions of Nebraska. We could hardly expect the pioneer to make every plantation a ■ss. Many were failures, but today there are thousands of speci - i of beautiful, valuable trees, which stand as monuments to the «»r efforts in solving the problems of state development. These issiul trees, growing in Nebraska soil, have assisted the early set- in carrying out an ideal which was to make Nebraska a better in which to live. The great majority of the early settlers, espe- &gt;.se who built homes in Nebraska in the KO's are no longer njoy the fruits of their achievements. Is ii asking too much of Nebraska's people today to spend one day n studying what trees have done for the state? Would it be worth our while to consider on April 22nd what it is possible to make trees do in Nebraska" Mr. Morton planted and preached the gospel of tree planting. The one thought uppermost in his mind was that trees are friends of man. He hoped that his fellow citizens would join with him in an effort to make Nebraska a state in which Nebraska's people could learn how to live and teach the rising generation how to use trees intelligently. Apparently one of the great problems in the mind of the early- settler was to conquer Nebraska's treeless plains. The great majority of the early emigrants into the state came from the eastern states. </seg>

Apparently the ideal established by the pioneers Nebraska has been misunderstood by Nebraska born citizens for they longer can be called tree planters. The people of the towns and ies have practiced systematic planting to a much greater extent than ve those who follow the business of farming. As a people we have been busy building cities where equipment or conducting business have absorbed time, space and attention which ormerly was given to tree planting. The spirit of business develop - ent and money making has not been confined alone to the cilies he Nebraska born farmer and those who have emigrated into the state nd taken up the pursuits of agriculture have, as a class, neglected to lant trees. Evidently the cash crops on the farm have absorbed the Mentions of those who practiced agriculture. No doubt the introdue - on and rapid extension of tenant farming has played a considerable art in the destruction of Nebraska's trees and the lailure to replace hem. We may enumerate all of the factors which have worked tor E&gt; discouragement of tree planting but it is wiser to let "the dead pasi ry its dead" and turn our attention and thoughts to the actual bcne - i to be derived by planting trees now and in th&lt;" future.

The practice of agriculture on a treeless plain may appear more profitable for a season or two, but just as sure as the sun rises and sets, trees an essential to the development of permanent and prosperous agriculture. Windbreaks and groves must be planted. We must use kinds of trees which have proven successful in the locality to be planted We no longer need to depend upon the maple, boxelder, and the ash. While these species grow and develop naturally along the streams of our state they have been one of the greatest sources of discouragement t&lt;&gt; the people who live out in the plains country and on the high lands back from the rivers and streams. Cedars, pine, spruces, the hackberry and the American elm will grow anywhere in the state of Nebraska. The hardy catalpa is adapte-i to the low lands of South Platte territory. In the eastern section of the state, walnut, the oaks and hickory are desirable and valuable trees for planting. We have plenty of examples ir our part of the state to show us the kinds of trees which will succeed in any given lo - cality. In the extreme western portion of the state the people will have to depend largely upon the evergreens and a few of the tested deciduous trees. Nebraska should not under-estimate the value of the cottonwood and its near relatives, the poplars. While these trees have many disagreeable features, they have been friends to the people </seg>

There is such a variety of uses which can be made of trees that it would hardly seem necessary to enumerate them as an inducement for Nebraska's people to plant trees. Windbreaks surrounding the building sites and the orchards present benefits which can be measured in dollars and cents. Ornamental trees for the lawn, shade trees, fruit trees, nut trees, all have their place in plant - ings which can be used in Nebraska. We need only »o look back over the recent history of our state to convince ourselves that the trees which have been planted in Nebraska have for the most part proven be useful to mankind Misunderstanding the uses of trees, wholesale experimentation with kinds of trees with which we are not familiar, planting trees too thick and in the wrong places, are phases of tree planting which must be discouraged. Trees properly planted, systematically arranged, are a positive benefit and an indication of progressive citizenship. The citizens of our state must learn the gospel of tree planting. W&lt;- must study the possibilities of state development from the stand - point of trees. Tree culture should be a part of our public school course of study. Take a trip with the superintendent of public in - struction and visit the hundreds of schools crowded in the busy cities and planted every four miles apart throughout the entire state of Ne - braska. You will find thousands of children, boys, girls, little tots, healthy youngsters, little men and little women, busily occupied learn - ing to read and to write and to spell; you will find that these little folks, the rising generation, have no thought of what the future holds in store for them. They merely are attending school learning the things the state has approved that they should learn to enable them to lay the foundation for citizenship. They depend upon the school patrons and the voters of the state to shape their destinies at least to fix the beginnings of the activities of life. What opportunities are being prepared by communities within the state which will furnish desirable vocations for these boys and girls of today who will be the active men and women of tomorrow? We sometimes wonder, will the cities hold them all. It is safe to say that so long as living condi - tions are more attractive and wages are higher in the cities, no amount of preaching will keep the boys and girls on the farm, nor will it en - courage those city born to drift into the pursuits of agriculture. When we reach that stage of development that as a people we desire to en - courage industrial life in the rural communities; when the time comes that it seems desirable to produce the things near the home that now we prefer to import from hundreds of miles away; when the time ar - rives that the cities have outgrown the country and the people feel a desire to own a home, supported by a productive industry; whenever </seg>

It is as pretty as an t vergreen in the r, but sheds its needles during the winter. The Larch is not of Nebraska but is a very valuable tree adapted to a wide soil conditions within the state, is a rapid grower, and its is \aluable for general use around the farm. There is perhaps ass of trees as beautiful as the evergreens. Everybody admires green tree. They afford the most desirable windbreak, owing act that they hold their leaves or needles throughout the year. V double row of evergreens, spaced properly will make an effective windbreak, will afford good protection for live stock, and are unques - tionably the most desirable trees for planting as a part of a landscape which should surround the farm buildings. The effect of a good windbreak surrounding the farm buildings on the lorth, west and south is not a theory or an idle dream, but a satisfactory comfort to the farmer who is obliged to attend to his livestock and tin he regu - lar chores required about the farm.

The State Horticultural society offers every encouragement with - in the power of the organization for the wider planting of these vain- </seg>

The comfort and satisfaction to be gotten from association with this class of trees would be an inspiration for all of Nebraska's citizenship to admire the country even better than the city. There is scarcely a farm in the state of NebraaKa upon which you cannot find a few acres of so-called waste land. If these spols could be planted to evergreens, the timber would, in a few years. pay a good return upon the land. The government has planted large tracts of evergreens on forest reserve lands in the sand hills of Ne - braska. These plantations are doing even better than experts antici - pated. An attempt to reforest the sand hills of Nebraska may not be economically profitable, but if it teaches the farmers and ranchers in the great plains country to use evergreens in planting on the waste lands and especially in surrounding the building site, it will be wort a a hundred times to the state whatever the experiment may cost. One peculiar character about evergreen trees is the pitchy sat circulation. Evergreens should always be handled, when transplant ing. with the greatest care, never letting the roots become dry by ex - posing to the sunlight and wind. If the pitchy sap of the roots be. comes dry in transplanting, the tree will invariably die. Many specie of evergreens can be transplanted alter they have grown lour to si&gt; feet in height and trees of almost any size and age can be transplanted in the winter, when the ground is frozen, by removing a large ba! of earth surrounding the roots of the trees. The soil should bt tramped firmly about the roots in spring planting and if possible bt saturated with water, after the tree is planted. If several farmers in a community would plan to make plantings of evergreens, it would be desirable for one of them to purchase a large number of young evergreen trees, from eight to iwelve inches in height. These can be purchased from the nurseryman for a much lower figure than the usual size recommended for planting. The&gt; can be lined out in rows, planted about two feet apart in the row and kept cultivated thoroughly. Evergreens handled in this way will make a remarkable growth and can be dug three or four years from such planting, hauled in wagons to the farm where they are to be permanently planted and set out with practically no loss whatever. rperation of this kind should be started as a means of encourag - the planting of more evergreen trees.

Horticultural science has progressed to such an extent that there need for a grower to allow his crop to be consumed by the vari- paola that might attack them. The work that has been done by various Experiment Stations and the United States Department of culture, has demonstrated that we have effective means for the hese various pests. However, the grower must know bout the trouble and be able to diagnose it correctly in pply the proper remedy which will hold this particular check. ive would consider for a few minutes the destructive insects ir control it would be necessary for the grower to know sev- In the first place he must determine whether the insect hat is, one which actually consumes the tissue plant, or whether it is a sucking insect which merely inserts Ml parts into the tissue of the plant and sucks out the plant or whether it is a boring insect, which as soon as it hatches bores directly into the tissue of the plants and lives y out ol reach of any insecticide that might be usad. By a il&gt;s«Tvation and study it becomes an easy matter to diagnose trouble and determine on the most effective remedy. If the plant actually consumed and disappears and on examination we find mis or adult insects present, we can be quite certain that we are ealing with a biting insect. In such an event a stomach poison ap - ilied to a plant will control the insect because when the poisoned ilant is taken into its system the insect is killed. Common insecti - ides in this class are arsenate of lead, Paris green, hellebore and pv - ethrum. However, the most important of this group and the one Ity &lt;i. W.

The method of application the strength of the poison is determined by the resistance of the t and ranges from 1 to 5 lbs. to 50 gallons of water. For the sucking insects the above class of insecticides are prac - tically worthless because the insect does not consume any part of the plant and consequently no poison is taken into its system. We are therefore compelled to use an entirely different class of insecticide and that class which will kill by coming in contact with the body of the sucking insect. A common example of sucking insects which are widely distributed is the plant lice. These are found on many plants and are very de - structive. For the plant lice and many other soft bodied insects, a tobacco spray of some kind is very effective. In the two commercial tobacco sprays, namely Black Leaf 4(i and Nicofunie, we have verv etive remedies for these insects. These contact insecticides are lially valued because they do not injure the plants and can be applied with great ease. They consist of about t9% Nicotine Sul- phate which is very soluble in water. This insecticide is made by d luting one part to from 500 to 1,000 parts of water. Some otlu insecticides for sucking insects are Lime Sulphur, Kerosene Emulsioi or strong soap suds. The point to remember in spraying for this clai of insects is that the insecticide must touch the body of the insei or there is no relief The boring insect, which la illustrated by the squa lically baffles all attempts at control by the us ides. W once the insect is inside the plant tissue, nothing can he do Here we have them divided into two groups, namely the bacteri eases and the fungus diseases. Perhaps the tiingus rii at numerous but the bacterial diseases are more difficult to contr fungus is a microscopic, parasitic plant which grows upon the hos plant. In some cases it attacks the fruit; in other cases the leav and stems. The symptoms of fungus diseases vary and are sometimes hard to detect. As a rule the plant will take on an unhealthy ap - pearance, usually yellowing of the tissue with subsequent dropping of the leaves, or certain portions of the leaves will be attacked, which will turn brown and finally drop. Careful observation with a little experience will soon aid in de - termining when a plant is attacked by a disease. As a rule when a plant is attacked by some disease, very little can be done in the way lig the larva out by spl lifting the It ■Ull Ik of the plant or MStroyii ntire plant.

            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 179 helping the plant. The chief means of combating the disease is o prevent it trom getting into the tissue and after the disease has UHf attacked Ihe plant our principal means of control is to prevent ■ I from spreading further. This is done by the use of fungicides, of which there are several in common use. For vegetable crops, without doubt the chief fungicide is Bordeaux Mixture. This is made by dis- solving 4 lbs. stone lime in 25 gals, water and 4 lbs. of copper sul - phate in 25 gals, water, and mixing the two diluted solutions. As a rule when the grower is undecided as to whether this plant i.s affected by a disease, he will be benefltted by the application of Iiordeaux Mixture and with many crops in certain sections of the nnintry it is very desirable to spray several times each season with Uurdeaux Mixture regardless of whether or not the plants are dis - • used, because fungicides are largely preventatives and not specifics. Bacterial diseases are much more difficult to control. In most rusts they are internal and found in the cell sap of the plant. As a rule spraying would be of no value and a plant affected with a bac - terial disease must usually be destroyed. A common example of a liaclerial disease is the melon wilt. The bacteria which causes this ilisea.se is found in the water ducts of the plant and us the plant srows the bacteria increase in number until they finally stop up the water passages causing the plant to wilt and die. When a plant of this kind is seen it should be destroyed immediately to prevent the inainder of the plants from becoming infected. Physiological troubles are a distinct group in themselves and are due to several causes. As a rule physiological troubles are thought be due to the lack of some element in the soil although they are caused by unfavorable environments which allow certain types of fungi to thrive. The most common physiological trouble which the gardener will be interested in is the damping off of seedlings. This trouble is known to be caused by several fungi and is a result of unfavorable growing conditions — usually a warm, moist atmosphere and a damp soil. When once the plant is attacked by this trouble it succumbs to the disease and the only remedy is to change the con - ditions. Usually by withholding water, giving plenty of fresh air and ventilation will check the disease from spreading. The fourth class of garden enemies are predaceous animars such as rabbits, mice, gophers and ground moles.

Extensive experiments carried on in the ■Outb- i slates with potatoes of the Triumph variety from Wisconsin and ■stern Nebraska during the 1920 season, resulted in the production more potatoes from western dry land potatoes than were produced jm any other state. These experiments were most carefully ear - ni on by i he I'nited States Department of Agriculture. In buying potatoes for seed purposes from any of these regions, nsonable precautions should be taken to select good seed potatoes. r poor potatoes are produced in these regions as well as any other gion. The potatoes should be true to type, of the variety and rela - iely free from disease. In considering type, especially when the arly Ohio is concerned, the potatoes should be of the long Ohio type id not of the short round type, though they should not be excessively tin with a small diameter. A potato should be cylindrical and not •d al either end. The eyes should be medium depth, they 1 not be bulging or shallow. Very shallow e; es often indicate the strain of potatoes is running out.

There is one disease which is ?ommon especially to those coming from the Red River Valley, disease is commonly known as rhizoctonia. This disease occurs ed potatoes as black specks of the size of a x»in head.

Not all of the soils in the Red River Valley re black and some of the potatoes coming from the Red River Val - y do not have very much dirt adhering to them. These spots, it ill be discovered cannot be washed off as dirt can, although they can p scraped off with the finger nail or knife. These spots contain the intering over stage of the disease.

The depth which garden seeds should be planted or covered with depends somewhat on the nature of the soil and the general eli- te conditions. It the garden has been carefully raked over so that have a fine seed bed, most garden seeds should be planted shallow, half inch to one inch is plenty deep to plant any garden seeds xcept peas, which should be planted 2% inches de.'p. Nature sows ii sitds on top of the ground depending on the fallen leaves and nd silted soils to furnish sufficient cover for germination. Seeds juire moisture, heal and air for germination: sunlight is only valu- o furnish heal. It is often a good practice to cover the rows planting with boards or burlap, which checks evaporation of nre Horn the soil and hastens germination. These coverings li&gt; removed when the seeds have germinated and the little plants ppear through the surface soil. If the weather is dry and hot, re - love coverings in the evening, or tilt the boards to admit only partial ■M until the little plants maintain a good green color. This prac- ice has often produced lettuce, radishes, beets, spinach and other egetables ten days to two weeks earlier. If you are planning to uulch your potatoes in the garden and want them for early use, plant the half tubers covering them with a good inch of soil and apply about a 2-inch mulch of straw as soon as the potatoes are planted. Then after the vines are six to eight inches high add two more inches of mulch, but before putting on the last mulch stir up the first straw with a fork, lilting it si&gt; as in allow a good circulation of air. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Method of Cultivation. In order to have a good garden, it must be cultivated. The umber and method of cultivation may depend somewhat upon the ature of the soil and the season. We have planted a garden patch nd fenced it, with the expectation that most of the cultivation given ill be done with a hoe. Some gardeners do most of their cultivating ith a garden rake, others use a wheel hoe or hand garden cultivator, "hatever is used, the principles of cultivation should be observed, eep the soil loose to a depth of at least two inches and never hoe the soil away from the vegetable nor ridge it up about the roots of the ants.

Do as little walking about n the garden as possible. It is remarkable what can be accomplished by thorough shallow cultivation. Some country homes and practically all of the eit&gt; homes will be provided with a water system which can be used in times of drought. In many parts of the state, especially western Ne - braska, the practice of mulching vegetable gardens should be mon generally used.

More attention and care should be given to the home garden. People who are situated so that they can have a garden should by all means plant one. We need vegetables in our daily diet. The expense for garden seeds is such a small item that even people of the most humble circumstances can well afford to buy their supply of garden seeds. A good garden is a wonderful assistance to the cook and the supply of vegetables prepared in nutritious soups, salads, slaws, stews to suit the fancy of the cook will make a mysterial saving in the grocery account. </seg>

Many people are inclined to think that horticulture is pretty well limited to the growing of an orchard which is an impression that should never have gotten a foothold in a state which presents such varied soil and climatic conditions as does Nebraska. Vegetable gardening is perhaps the most important line of horti - ullural industry to the people in the state of Nebraska. More people ;row vegetables and enjoy the use of vegetable crops than any other rops which belong to the field of horticulture. Practically every country home has a vegetable garden and a large per cent of the homes in the towns and cities also support a garden of some descrip - tion. Potatoes are a vegetable crop and are studied as horticulture in the colleges of the country. Truck gardening which presents quite large industries near the cities and larger towns of the state, is one of the important lines of the horticultural practice. There are many problems which require expert knowledge for their solution connected with the growing of various vegetable crops. Nearly all of vegetables are bothered with insect enemies or plant diseases. In any parts of the state the vine crops, such as melons, squash, pump- kin, and cucumbers have been abandoned because the growers were un - able to successfully combat the plant lice, beetles ana bugs which de - stroyed the vines. These insects can be controlled; there is no reason why practically every farmer in the state should not have a melon patch and grow squash for summer and winter use. Pumpkins for the home pies and cucumbers for pickles. In some sections of the state, which support canning factories, pumpkins are grown in large quanti- ties and proved to be a paying crop. Nebraska soils and sunshine seem to impart a desirable flavor to watermelons and cantaloups. The city trade would consume large quantities of these vegetables if they were properly grown and handled in an attractive way. Ornamental gardening is a very important department of horti - cultural industry in Nebraska. The use of ornamen al trees, shrubs, vines and herbaceous plants for decorating the home grounds, the parks, the cemeteries, the streets and highways, will become more and more important as the state grows older. Three-fourths of Nebraska's population will always have opportunity to use and enjoy this class of plantings. Without the intelligent use of ornamental trees and flowering plants, Nebraska can never be a state of attractive homes. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 FIFTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Many of these plains crow wild in different MetteM of the stale. They lend themselves nicely to domestic cultivation. The writer's reason tor assuming that this phase ol horticulture is second in importance is the fact that these plants are available tor the use of the majority ol Nebraska's people. They are perennial and most of them will live and thrive throughout the life lime of the average person. Increase the opportunity and advisability for home owning and you will increase the use of ornamental planting and promote substantial development of the state. The second very important line of horticultural industry is Flori culture. The growing of flowers in Nebraska can be praciiced by ill large majority of the people and enjoyed by all. The green hous business represents several million dollars in industry each ye;n Floriculture is not confined to growing flowers under glass.

At the present time however this line of hoit industry is of relatively small importance to the slate. » ■ Orcharding and fruit growing, the line of horticultural woik which most people seem to think means horticulture, is of some im - portance in Nebraska.

So many growers have failed in an attempt to grow lackberries and raspberries, that this industry has never been de - eloped, even in sections of the state where cane fruits grow wild along streams and in protected places. </seg>

A|&gt;|»le Display There were so many features of interest in the apple display that pace in this paper will not permit mention of all. There was a class &gt;t barreled apples, different commercial varieties, a class of boxed apples and the larger portion of the wall space was occupied by tray xhibils. The plate exhibits were on tables in the center of the audi- shown in the accompanying photograph. I'io!. Cooper of the Arkansas Experiment Station, co-operating he Frisco Railway System, brought a splendid showing of Jona - \rkansas Black, Grimes Golden and Ben Davis. A man by the name of Webster over on the Mississippi river in hern Minnesota, surprised fruit growers and upset theories about the northern line for successful Jonathan growing, by carrying oft practically all of the first prizes in box, tray and plate exhibits with Minnesota grown Jonathans. This is something that has never hap - pened in previous exhibitions and it was not thought that Jonathan would succeed so far north. V. Beach's exhibit of the results of his apple breeding xperiinenis and demonstrations, perhaps attracted more interest than ny single exhibit in the auditorium. He has crossed Salome on Jonathan. Ben Davis on Delicious, and a number of other crosses and brought the fruit to show the results of his work. The Iowa State Agricultural College through the work of Prof. Beach, is developing and introducing new and valuable varieties. Expert apple judges were permitted to taste samples of these new apples and many of the nurserymen are contemplating propagating so apple trees may be of - tVred for sale in a few years to apple growers in the state of Nebraska.
