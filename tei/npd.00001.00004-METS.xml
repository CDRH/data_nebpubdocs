REPORT OF ADJUTANT GENERAL. 

ORGANIZATION. 

The act to establish a Military Code for the State of Nebraska 
approved February 28, 1881, went into effect June 1st of that year, 
and under its provisions immediate steps WCN taken by this department 
for placing the same in operation. 

The military organization of this State previous to June 1, 
1881, had been known and designated as the Nebraska State 
Militia and was made up of independent organizations known a3 
Companies D, E, G, and J of the Second Regiment X. S. M. and 
the Wahoo Foragers, Wahoo; Juniata Independents, Juniata; 
Beatrice Guards, Beatrice; Alexander Guards, Nelson; Bennet 
Rifles, Bennet, and Merrick Rifles, Central City. These ten 
companies comprising the Nebraska State Militia, were, on July 
5, A. D., 1881, transferred by general order, to the Nebraska 
National .Guard, and on the same date an order was issued directing 
all the commissioned officers thereof to meet in the City of 
Lincoln, July 12, 1881, for the purpose of effecting a regimental 
organization from among the officers of said Guard. 

Accordingly on the date aforesaid, a delegation of the commissioned 
officers from each company presented themselves, and 
at a meeting held effected a regimental organization by choosing 
Leonard W. Colby, of Beatrice, as Colonel; W. J. Keller, 
of Sutton, as Lieutenant Colonel, and George D. Adamson, of 
York, as Major. 

The selection of these officers being subsequently recommended 
to the department the same were duly approved and commissioned 
on and after July 13, 1881. This constituted the Field 
officers of the First Regiment of the Nebraska National Guard </seg>

REPORT OF IHB 

On July 13, 1881, through a general order the following offi- 
Cwere announced as the staff of the Governor and Comder-in-Chief: 
S. J. Alexander, Adjutant General; Cyrus N. 
Baird, Quartermaster General; Melville W. Stone, Surgeon General; 
L. D. Richards, Commissary General; Edward P. Roggen, 
Assistant Adjutant General; Franklin Sweet, Inspector 
General and J. S. Lehew, Advocate General. 

The gWMrd and iv&lt;_n mental organization of the Guard having 
been effected and completed as the Code contemplated, active 
means were then entered into to bring the organization up to a 
thorough standard of military discipline. A degree of proficiency 
having been reached in the work of the several companies, an 
encampment of the First Regiment was then ordered to be held 
for four successive days between the 5th and 10th days of September, 
1881, the city of Lincoln being designated by the Com- 
Cding officer of the regiment as the place at which the enpment 
should be held, transportation and commutation of 
rations being furnished by the State. 

The Blue Springs Light Artillery was at this time attached to 
the First Regiment X. N". G., and it with the several companies 
composing the First Regiment were ordered to report with only 
such men as were fully uniformed. 

From the date of the encampment down to March 11, 1882, 
when the outbreak occurred at Omaha, which necessitated the 
calling out of Guard; nothing of general interest transpired. 

The calling out of the regiment for the protection of the citizens 
of Omaha, on occasion of trouble between the working men 
of Omaha and the municipal authorities of that city, in March 
last, having already been brought to your official notice and needs 
no further mention from this office at this time, further than to 
repeat my former commendations as to the efficiency and behavior 
displayed by the officers and men of the State troops on this occasion 
of the threatened demonstrations against law and order 
in that city. </seg>

INSPECTION*. 

During the time since the present code went into effect, two 
inspections of the National Guard of this State have been ordered, 
the more recent one being under a general order from these 
headquarters dated June 9, 1882. The report of these inspections 
as made by Major Franklin Sweet, Inspector General, will 
be found on the accompanying pages of this report, and the 
thorougli manner in which the duties devolving upon this officer 
have been performed will be better evidenced by a careful perusal 
of the subject matter his report contains. This department 
can only add by way of favorable comment thereon, that in Major 
Sweet, the Guard have found a faithful and efficient officer. 

The accompanying report of the Inspector General contains 
many valuable suggestions in the interest of the service, and as 
the same are made from an experienced stand-point and personal 
observation, they should be fully considered by your Excellency. 

ENCAMPMENT? 

The law under which we are now operating provides that 
encampments of the National Guard shall be held annually or 
biennially, as the Comhiander-in-Chief may order, but one encampment 
of State troops has been held during the past two 
vears, viz., that of 1881. 

As these encampments are intended solely for the purpose of 
schooling our State troops in field maneuvers and battalion drill, 
it is believed that the best interests of the service require that 
this duty should be performed each year, but unless sufficient 
money is provided to meet the expense attending the same, in 
the forth coming appropriations, the performance of this duty 
must of necessity be deferred and the encampment be only ordered 
bienniallv. 

Too high an estimate cannot be placed upon the value of these 
encampments, the benefits that accrue to our soldiers more than 
doubly compensate for the small outlay that is required to meet </seg>

            <seg id="p008">

REPORT OF THE 

the expenses that would attend the holding of annual encampments, 
and I would therefore most earnestly recommend that the 
additional amount needed to meet this matter be appropriated. 

MILITARY PROPERTIE 

The care and custody of all military properties belonging to 
the State of Nebraska, is intrusted, under our code, to the Quartermaster 
General, and his report covering the transactions of 
his office since June 1, A. D., 1831, to the present time, will be 
found appended herewith in convenient form, and the several 
recommendations as made therein, meet my hearty approval, 
and are thought by this office to be well worthy of your attention 
and careful consideration. 

Under this head it has been deemed important enough to mention 
to your Excellency the fact that our state still continues to 
receive her annuities of ordinance stores from the general government, 
the amount placed to our credit in the War Department 
reaching the sum of fifteen hundred dollars per annum, 
which has been drawn from time to time, in such ordinance aa 
the wants of our service would seem to require, the prices paid 
therefor being those as printed and scheduled by the TJ. S. Government. 


UNIFORMS. 

The subject of uniforming the National Guard of this State 
has engrossed the attention of this department and that of the 
Quartermaster General's Department to no inconsiderable extent 
during the past three or four months and I am pleased to inform 
your Excellency that after some considerable delay incident upon 
a careful examination of the several samples of cloth and material 
submitted, the Quartermaster General has been able to procure 
for the State troops a complete uniform of the U. S. regulation 
fatigue infantry pattern, from the out-fitting house of E. 
Williams, Chicago, Illinois; the order covering three hundred 
suite. With this expenditure as made on behalf of the State, it </seg>

ADJUTANT 0KNERA1.

is now believed that the wants of the service will have been mel 

for some years to come, in this direction 

ENROLLED MILITIA 

The section of our military code providing for an enrollment 
of "militia"' should be dispensed with fend the section of the law 
providing for it repealed, the system has beeoaM obsolete and is 
of no manner of use in times of peace. Moreover, the expense 
ding the same, which attaches to the counties, is no inconsiderable 
item. The department would therefore, ursje its repeal 
at the forthcoming session of our Legislature, wholly on the 
ground of its extraneous nature. 

TATE A..IIORY 

It is believed that the time has arrived when a more suitabl 

Ei for the deposit of military stores should be provided by the 
; than has been done in the past, and to that end this departt 
would ask that an appropriation ample enough be made for 
proper preparation of a room in the capitol building at Lincoln, 
Eible for the care and custody of all military properties, whic'.i 
now of public necessity required to be kept stored at the 
e House. 

Chen the fact is taken into consideration that the State lias 
ys on hand military stores to the value of several thousand 

of dollars, the economy and wisdom of providing a place for their 
Eage should suggest itself to every legislator: I therefore. 
it earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made tor the 
ve purpose. 

OFFICE ANIi RECORDS. 

The records of the Nebraska volunteers are under the ear.' 

and control of this office, and are always in demand by the ex- 

eoldiers of these regiments who call for the same, that official in- 

formation may be had by them in the prosecution of their claims 
before the U. S. Land and Pension office. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">
In ruv former report your attention was invited to the tact that 
a number of the muster rolls of our Nebraska volunteer companies 
were lacking or missing, as the case may be. As this department 
has no data at its command in determining whether 
the same wire Hied, or on the other band, to know as to whether 
the same was removed after being deposited herein, the fact 

however exists at the present time, of the a ; from the offi 
dal records of the office. And in view of the constant and in- 

creasing demand that is being made from time to time for certified 
copies of these missing records, it is believed that the State 
should take immediate steps towards having the rolls that are 
now lacking replaced by the War Department. This can be 
done at a very slight expense, ami no further delay in view of 
their importance should be had in their procurement. 

Aside from the above records of our volunteer forces, I would 
beg leave to say that the records of the office are all in a good 
condition and proper state of preservation, the increased facilities 
afforded by the removal of the office from the old quarters to the 
new ones in the treat wring, have permitted of an enlarged system 
of indexing and storage of these important trusts. 

The work of the office has increased from year to year; the 
fact being more particularly noticeable since Congress has added 
an increased force of clerks in the Pension Bureau. The settle- 

ment therein of pension claims for claimants who formerly belonged 
to our volunteer soldiers, has been the means of enlarging 
the correspondence that passes between the department at 
Washington and thisoftice to a very great extent, and to meet this 
particular increase of the work of this office, and also the other 
increasing volumes of work that have arisen under the adoption 
of the military system of this State, it is believed that in the in- 

terests of the public good and all concerned, an appropriation 
of not less than three hundred dollars should be made for extra 
clerk hire. This amount, if appropriated, would atford means to 
obtain clerical help for the office in the future, whenever needed, 
thus enabling the department to transact its business with the 

10 </seg>

ADJUTANT &lt;JF.NER.AL. 

public with dispatch and promptness on all occasions, and to relieve 
the department from the embarrassment that it has lab 
under in the past in this connection. 

ARMAMENT. 

The ten companies of infantry which now comprise the First 
Regiment of the Nebraska National Guard, are armed with the 
improved Springfield breech-loa^lin^ ritls, calibre 50. The 
artillery branch of the service have two bronze 12-pound gun-;. 

of the old U. S. pattern. Each of these guns having been «1 ¦•- 
clared unserviceable have accordingly been condemns 1, and their 
use prohibited except under very limited restrictions. 

It is recommended that steps be taken by the State to exchange 
the infantry arm for one of a smaller pattern, the one in 
use being deemed too large and clumsy for perfect handling. 

GENERAL RECOMMENDATION 

The department, as has been previously stated in this report, 
joins with the Inspector General and Quartermaster General in 
the several recommendations urged by them in their respective 
reports, and the hope is confidently expressed that the Legislature, 
at its forthcoming session, will deal liberally with the militarv 
branch of our state government. 

Under the present law, all future appropriations are limited to 
$2,500, annually ; this amount as has been learned from actual 
experience in the past is wholly insufficient, even under the most 
rigid economy, to meet the actual wants of the service. The appropriation 
annually of five thousand dollars is required to meet 
and carry out the requirements of the law, as indicated in the 
code. An appropriation ample enough should be made to pay 
armory rent and the expenses of an annual encampment. This 
oannot be met where only twenty-five hundred is appropriated 
for the vearly maintenance of the Guard. </seg>

CONCLUSION 

I cannot close this report without expressing for myself, and 
the National Guard of Nebraska, whom you have so ably commanded 
during the past two years, my high appreciation of the 
many courtesies extended this department This sustaining confidence 
and support so cheerfully given at all times, has done 
much towards strengthening me in the performance of my official 
duties, as well as to bring forth from the officers and men of 
our citizen soldiers, that loyalty and devotion which goes so far 
towards eliciting the more noble attributes of the true soldier. 

Inspector General's Office,

Brigadier General S. J. Alexander, 

\&gt;l,ittant General and Chief of Stuff, Lincoln, Nebraska 

General: I have the honor to report that, in obedience to 
General Order No. 4, dated Headquarters Nebraska National

Infantry, Nebraska National Guard and the Blue Springs</seg>

ADJUTANT tiENERAL. 

Suficient notice having been given the several commands, I 
began my tour of inspection on the 26th of June, and submit 
the following report: 

In making this inspection I have endeavored to ascertain, M 
far as possible, the condition of the National Guard and its 
effectiveness as a military establishment, as a conservator of the 
peace, and as the chief support of the civil power in case ot" ne- 

cessity 

With these objects in view, everything bearing on the subject 
has been investigated as thoroughly as practicable, particularly 
the zeal, ability and fitness of the commissioned officer*, the state 
of discipline, military appearance and bearing of the enlisted 
men, frequency of drills and instruction, uniformity and condition 
of clothing, general condition of arras and equipments, company 
records and armory rent. 

It was perhaps unfortunate that the inspection was made during 
the busy season, as a majority of the men are farmers, and a 
full attendance as would have been desirable, was thereby precluded. 

The commissioned officers of the several companies are, for the 
most part zealous, of good ability, and well fitted to occupy their 
respective positions; there are, I regret to say, exceptions where 
officers are apathetic or indifferent, or both, and in some instances 
where they are accused of conniving at and instigating 
insubordination. 

I do not find that any of the company commanders ha\ 
adopted any special or systematic method of instruction for th 
officers and non-commissioned officers of their commands, am 
it would seem to be for the best interests of the service, that con 
manding officers of companies be required to institute schools t'&lt; 
the theoretical instruction of the officers and sergeants, sem 
monthly at least, as the periodical drills are the only means o 
instruction, except individual reading up, without recitation. 

The state of discipline is not as good as could be desired or a;-tained, 
and though company commanders, with tew exceptions </seg>

            <seg id="p014">

KKPORT OK THE 

claim that good discipline prevails in their commands, yet my 
observations lead me to believe that too much excellence in this 
respect is claimed, as the indications of discontent were not, in 
my opinion, compatible with a high state of discipline. 

In the companies where the attendance at inspection was greatest, 
there also appeared to be the best discipline; this was notably 
the case with Company "I" at Bennett and Company " G " at 
fneva. I believe, however, that as the material is mostly good 
all the companies, that proper attention to their wants by the 
State, and some salutary admonition to the officers, a very satis 
tuctorv state of discipline can readily be attained. 

KPhe military appearance of a few companies were very good ; 
)thers much afi'ected by the bad conditions of their uniforms, 
ich were much worn and soiled. The bearing of the men with 
few exceptions, was soldierly and good. 

Company drills since the return of the regiment from Omaha, 
have been desultory, and in some instances suspended till the 
busy harvest season is over. The designated time for drill varies 
from weeklv to monthly. 

In some companies tliev bare had some target practice, but I 
failed to find any authority for such expenditure of ammunition, 
either from general or regimental headquarters. A certain 
Iount of tarir't practice prescribed by orders from competent 
hority, and a record thereof kept b}- company commanders, 
aid no doubt be beneficial and instructive, but authority for 
• expenditure of ammunition ought to be derived from General 
Regimental Headquarters. . • 

En regard to uniforms and their condition. I have to report a 
y unsatisfactory condition. 

I It is a well established fact that the men have heretofore pro- 
ded and paid for their uniforms themselves, and thus far the 
ational Guard has been of no expense to the State for clothing, 
but they v rv justly refuse to expend their own means any further 
for this purpose, and h»T« waited with patience for the State to 
uniform them, as it should do. </seg>

            <seg id="p015">

ADJUTANT OENERAI 

The consequence of the different organizations furnishing their 
own uniforms is, that there is much diversity of uniforms; they 
are nearly all about worn out, soiled and untit for further ser- 

vice. 

Complaint is general that the State has failed to do simple justice 
to its troops in the way of uniforms and armor}- rent ; tinmen 
are greatly discontented from this cause, and will become 
more and more dissatistied, until the existence of the National 
Guard would seem to be decided by the question of uniform 
alone. 

A large proportion of the commissioned officers of companies 
have failed to provide themselves with the regulation uniform M 
prescribed by Section 23 of the Code, most of them saying that as 
soon as the State provided new uniforms for the enlisted men, they 
would supply themselves with the uniform required. 

The vexed question of uniform must necessarily be settled 
promptly, and should the State furnish them soon, it would result 
greatly to the benefit of the service, restore confidence and 
a better condition generally. 

For the infantry I would strongly recommend the regulation t'a 

rrn, as being neat, serviceable and economical 

igu 

While on the subject of uniforms, it might be well to state that 
Captain C. If. Murdock, Company " A" First light Artillery, 

itherwise known as the '"Blue Springs Light Artillery," has reently 
purchased twenty-eight late regulation dress uniforms for 

his company, the material of which is good, and the}- fit good. 
I would recommend that this uniform become the property of 
the State, and Captain Murdock be re-imbursed the amount expended, 
less the $75 already apportioned his company, on 
presentation of original inroioea and receipted bills, as vouchers. 

Company "D" at Columbus, have twenty -three uniforms of a 
late regulation dress pattern, though I think not the latest, they 
are soiled considerably, and are not in general use by other com- 

panies </seg>

            <seg id="p016">

REPORT OF THE 

The genera] condition of the arras are such, that while nei rly 
all are serviceable, they are not in as clean, good order as they 
should be; exceptions in this respect are made in favor of companies 
"I)"" and "G," the arms of which were reasonably clean 
and in ijood condition. 

The equipments, waist belts, bayonet scabbards, etc., are all in 
good serviceable condition. The cartridge boxes are of an old, 
obsolete pattern, originally intended to be used with muzzleloader 
calibre 58, and are inconvenient for use with the breechloader, 
they are therefore unfit for service. As a matter of convenience 
ami ease, if not of health, the men should be provided 
with shoulder, or cross belts, to sustain the waist belt and cart- 

ridge boxes. 

Some of the companies have their company records written up 
complete ; Companies " I" and &gt;% II" excel in the very complete 
and methodical manner in which their company records are kept, 
especially is this the case with Company "II." Some have their 
records partially completed, while a few have neglected this important 
matter. 

Armories and armory rent will be found noted in the recapitulation 
by companies ; no case exists where the rent paid is excessive 
or unreasonably high. 

A few companies are in arrears for rent, Company " E" being 
most in debt, being in arrears- since April 1, 1882. 

By paragraph II, of General Order Xo. -4, the additional duty 
of directing the making of complete roster by companies in 
duplicate, devolved upon me; this required additional time, and 
after repeated instructions, I can report that the rosters ;ire 
nearly all completed and will be filed shortly. 

Some irregularity in the matter of making enlistments must be 
noted. First, Captain CM. Copp,of Company" E, " about the time 
his company was ordered out into active service, during the riots in 
Omaha, in March last, enlisted two men with whom he Stipulated 
that as soon as the company returned to Wahoo, they should 1 e 
dropped from the rolls and not held to service any longer. I </seg>

tered that it would hardly be possible to get them together, that 

the busiest season of the year was at hand, and that numbers of 

his men were sufferers from the severe hail-storm that devastated 

that section of country a short time previous. 

I forbear to criticise, or oti'er any suggestions in this case, the 

inferences are palpable

The above enumerated arms are kept in the armory of each

95 rifles: making a total of 585 guns. 

I NIFUKMS. 

The State militia have from date of enlistment until November, 
1882, furnished and paid for their own uniforms. 

On the 22nd of July, 1882, I was directed to call upon the 
company commanders to make requisition for uniforms as provided 
by section 24 " Militia Law," at the same time I asked for 
Vjposals from six clothing establishments (four of them military), 
make fatigue uniforms, each proposal to be accompanied by a 
sample uniform. After a careful examination of the samples 
and price of each, I awarded the contract to Col. E. Williams, 
agent of McConuell &amp; Co., Chicago, to make 332 fatigue uniforms 
at a cost of $7.75 per uniform, for cap, blouse and pants. 

The uniforms have been received and delivered and receipts 
taken for the same from the captains of the various companies.

Kuch company should be allows! a year for armory rent. 
The law requires that the N. X. G. shall hold an encampment for 
four days, annually or biennially. This is attended with such 
an expense that it does not leave a sufficient amount to furnish 
uniforms, pay armory rent and other neceMurj ugMMMi 

I would recommend that section 4-"5 of the Militia Law be 
amended so that the regiment may hold an encampment between 
May 20 and September 20, for the reason that May 30 is generally 
observed as "Decoration Day" throughout this country, and 
I am fully convinced that different localitiei would tender such 
inducements to the "Nebraska National Guard " to participate 
with them on that occasion and that it would tend largely to 
augment the expenses of an eucampment of the troops.
