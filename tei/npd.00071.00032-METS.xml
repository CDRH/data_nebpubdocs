            <seg id="p004">A Study of Kerosene Cook Stoves SUMMARY The purpose of this study was to learn the advantages and disad - vantages of various types of kerosene cook stoves used in Nebraska. TYPES OF STOVES STUDIED Kerosene cook stoves have burners of four types. Ten stoves representing the four types were studied as follows: four stoves having long-chimney wick burners; three stoves having short-chimney wick burners; two stoves having short chimneys with asbestos kindlers or lighting rings; one stove having wickless burners. STUDIES MADE ON FOUR TYPES OF BURNERS To determine comparative performance of the four types of burners, they were tested for: (1) time- required to heat a known quantity of water thru a known range of temperature; (2) thermal efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the heat units absorbed by the cooking process to the heat units liberated by the kerosene; (3) time required to cool; (4) tendency to form soot on utensil; (5) prac - tical use under home conditions. TIME REQUIRED FOR HEATING To determine comparative speed of burners, equal quantities of water were heated thru equal ranges of temperature. The tests were made by two methods: (1) the "cold start", in which the time re - quired to heat the water after the lighting of the cold burner was . determined; and (2) the "hot start", in which the time was determined with the burner fully heated at the beginning of the test. Data presented in this bulletin on comparative heating time of different types of burners selected for this study show that by the "cold start" method the average time required to heat the water by all long-chimney wick burners, adjusted as directed for maximum heat, was significantly less than averages for other types. The time re - quired by one short-chimney burner studied was less than that of one long-chimney burner. The wickless burner required the longest to heat of the four types. By the "hot start" method,- the average time required to heat the water was approximately equal for burners with wicks; the average time required by burners with lighting- rings and by wickless burners was greater than by those with wicks. The wickless required the longest time. Some differences in speed of heating of individual ' burners of the same type were greater than average differences for groups of different types. Giant burners studied required less time to heat the water than standard burners on the same stove. Burners covered with heavy grates required a longer time to heat . the water than burners covered by open grates. TIME OF COOLING Burners with wicks cooled more rapidly than other types. The wickless burners held heat longest. THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF BURNERS To determine the comparative thermal efficiency of burners, equal amounts of water, at the same initial .temperature, were completely evaporated, and the amount of kerosene used was determined. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 48 Data presented on comparative thermal efficiency of burners selected for this study show that the average thermal efficiency of all long - chimney wick burners was lower than that of burners of other types. The average thermal efficiency of short-chimney wick burners was highest of the four types. One burner of the short-chimney lighting - ring type was higher in thermal efficiency than the average for short chimneys with wicks. The wickless burner was higher in thermal efficiency than long-chimney burners, but lower than the two remaining types. Standard burners were higher in thermal efficiency than giant burners on the same, stove. FORMATION OF SOOT Long-chimney burners adjusted as directed by the manufacturer for maximum heat, that is, with yellow tips 1% inches above the blue flame, did not form soot on utensils.' Other types of burners formed soot frequently. Because of the contact of the flame with the utensil, these burners are more likely to be affected by outside factors, causing soot to be formed. EFFECT OF SIZE OF UTENSIL To learn the effect of the size of utensil on the performance of burners, water was heated thru equal ranges of temperature in pans of equal depth but varying in diameter. Giant and standard burners on the same stove were used for the tests. Records were kept of the time required to heat the water and of the oil consumed. Data pre - sented show that (1) as diameter of pan increased thermal efficiency increased, reaching a maximum at the largest pans, and (2) as diam - eter of pan increased time per pound required to heat it thru a given range of temperature decreased, reaching a minimum at the largest pans. The practical significance of these results is that for every burner there is a definite size of utensil which can be used to best advantage. From the standpoint of economy of time and fuel utensils should in general be fairly large. PRACTICAL USE OF BURNER'S To determine comparative cost of operation and time used for the cooking of food with different types of burners, a week's menus for six persons were cooked on four selected stoves representing the dif - ferent burner types. The burners were operated so as to use the minimum amount of time and oil. Data presented show that the long-chimney burner, over a week's time, used the greatest amount of kerosene. The short-chimney wick burner used the least kerosene of the four types. The total cost of operation, including wicks, lighting rings, and gasoline for priming the wickless burner, was highest for the long-chimney wick burner. For the wickless burner the total cost was slightly less than for the long - chimney wick burner. The total costs for the short-c'himney with wick and the lighting-ring burners were lowest and approximately equal. Time required in burner hours was approximately equal for the long-chimney wick burner and the burner with lighting ring. The time required by the wickless burner, was greatest of the four types. The burners with wicks were more quickly and easily adjusted for varying degrees of temperature for cooking purposes than were the other types of burners. • . </seg>
            <seg id="p006">A Study of Kerosene Cook Stoves A Study of Kerosene Cook Stoves EDNA B. SNYDER' Kerosene cook stoves are widely used in Nebraska rural homes, and until gas is brought within reach or electric power becomes cheap enough to compete with other fuels, kerosene will continue to be the chief fuel during the summer months. There is little exact information available concern - ing the relative merits of the various kerosene cook stoves offered on the market. This study was undertaken to learn the advantages and disadvantages of the different stoves sold in Nebraska. Any kerosene burner, to give satisfactory service, should meet the following requirements: (a) it should be quick to develop a steady flow of heat; (b) ( it should perform the operations of heating rapidly; (c) it should not be extrava - gant in the use of fuels; (d) its provision for draft should be such that the fuel is completely oxidized to prevent objection - able odor and the formation of soot; (e) the burner should be simple to operate and easy to clean. In this bulletin are reported studies on: (a) time of heating; (b) thermal efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the heat units ab - sorbed by the cooking process to the heat units liberated by the kex-osene; (c) tendency to form soot on utensils; (d) the relation of size of utensil to performance of burners ; and (e) practical use, under home conditions. TYPES OF STOVES STUDIED Ten stoves, differing in major constructional features as listed below, were selected and purchased for study. All of these are stoves rather widely advertised and sold in Ne - braska. One stove was purchased from a leading mail order house. (a) Four stoves studied have long-chimney burners with wicks. (b) Three stoves have short-chimney burners with wicks. (c) Two stoves have short-chimney burners with asbestos kindlers or lighting rings. (d) One stove has wickless burners. Some differences in frame construction affecting the per - formance of the burners are as follows: (a) The burners on one stove selected are covered with heavy iron tops or grates, similar to those on coal stoves, ex - cept that there are openings directly over the flame. (b) The stove with the heavy iron top and another with a lighter weight top have draft spaces back of the burners, 1 This project was outlined by Dr. Greta Gray, now Associate Professor of Home Economics in the University of California, at Los Angeles. Dr. Gray selected several of the stoves studied and supervised the preliminary work on the project. </seg>

These spaces are enclosed so that the surplus heated air from the burner is retained. (c) Burners on the remaining eight stoves are covered by open grates similar to those commonly used on gas stoves. (d) Three of the stoves haye both giant and standard burners. The diameter of a giant burner exceeds that of a standard, on the same stove, generally 1 to 2 inches, the dif - ference varying on different makes of stoves. Table 1 shows stoves included in the study, grouped as to type of burner, and also lists other constructional features.

Thruout the discussion following, the burners will be referred to as in Table 2. The measurements used for diameters of burners are the diameters of the circles bounding the outside of the wick tube, on burners with wicks; and the diameters of the circles bounding the outer edge of the oil trough, for the other types. The diameter of the flame produced is, in wick burners, slightly greater than the diameter of the wick tube. </seg>

With this type of burner, the flame is very close to the utensil, or just below the grate. DESCRIPTION OF THE LABORATORY The ten stoves studied were placed in a laboratory so that conditions might.be as nearly uniform as possible. Doors and windows were kept closed during the tests, to prevent %&gt;}:. u « dimensi ons of the laboratory were 21' 9" by 17 4 by 10' 4", with 3,899 cubic feet of contents.

In the group which includes the four long-chimney burners with wicks, the diameters are the same except for one burner, which is slightly more than the others. In the group including the three short-chimney burners with wicks, the diameters ?u *i? ? tly ' the 2 reatest diameter being % inch greater tftan the least. In the group including the two short-chimney burners with lighting rings, there is a difference of U inch in diameter. The burners on the stove of the wickless type were all giant; therefore no wickless-type burner is included in the standard-burner groups. A comparison of time of heating of the burners in the long-chimney wick group shows that Nos. 1 and 12 required significantly less time than the others in both the "cold start" w^iS 6 ?°f l^f test I- The chimney on No - 12 is dou ble walled about half way down from the top, with perforations to admit air where the two walls join.

            <seg id="p016">A Study of Kerosene Cook Stoves burners of this group is controlled by the amount of oil allowed to flow into the burner bowl. The burner bowl on No. 5 moves up and down with the chimney, increasing or diminishing the amount of oil around the kindler or lighting ring. On the front of the stove is a dial which indicates the depth of oil in the trough. The burner bowl on No. 11 is stationary, the oil entering thru a valve which opens directly from the supply pipe, making it more difficult to gauge the amount of oil turned into the trough. An excess of oil causes the flame to flare around the utensil, heating the water in less time. The burners differ in provision for air. No. 5 has circular openings at the bottom of the chimney, while No. 11 is entirely open. A comparison of averages of heating time of the different types for the "cold start" tests shows that those with long - chimney wick burners heated most rapidly. However, No. 2, in the short-chimney wick-burner group, was more rapid than No. 10 in the long-chimney group. Averages for the groups including short-chimney wick and short-chimney lighting-ring burners are approximately equal. It will be observed, however, that there are individual differences be - tween burners of the same type as great as average differ - ences between groups of different _ types. . Differences of heating time between groups of types from the "hot start" were not significant. The wick burners of both types were slightly more rapid than the lighting-ring group. These results are consistent with curves in Figure 5. The difference in heating time between long- and short - chimney burners is due to the more complicated construction of the chimney and combustion chambers on the latter, re - quiring longer to become fully heated after the "cold start". TIME REQUIRED FOR GIANT .BURNERS TO HEAT Table 4 shows the time required by each giant burner to i-aise the temperature of four pounds of water from 15° C. to 98° C. (59° F. to 208.4° F.) both by "cold" and "hot" start methods. The table includes one giant burner of each type. The burners are equal in diameter, except for No. 9, a wickless type, which is 'Y\. inch greater in diameter than the others. The long-chimney wick burner, No. 13, was most rapid in both "cold" and "hot" starts, exceeding the others considerably. Burner No. 6, short chimney with lighting ring, ranked second in heating time for both tests. No. 8, a short-chimney wick type, was slow in the "cold start" test. This burner is covered by a heavy iron top, preventing direct transfer of heat to utensil. When used with an open top, it </seg>

            <seg id="p018">A Study op Kerosene Cook Stoves was much more rapid. No. 9 was slowest with the "cold" but approximately equal to No. 8 for the "hot" start. This burner is made of heavy iron parts which require a longer time to become hot. . The curves in Figure 5 show how much more slowly No. 9 heats than the other types of burners. RELATION OF DIAMETER OF BURNER TO TIME OF HEATING Tables 3 and 4 indicate that type of burner bears a more direct relation to speed of heating than does diameter. In the group of long-chimney wick burners (Table 3, standard burners) , No. 10, which is greatest in diameter, was slowest for the "cold start" test. In the group of short-chimney lighting-ring burners, No. 3, the least in diameter, was the slowest in the group, but No. 7, the greatest in diameter, was not the most rapid. The giant burner No. 9 (Table 4) is the greatest in diameter and was the slowest of the four types of giant burners. A comparison of the heating records of giant and standard burners shows that some standard burners heated more rapidly than did some giant burners on other stoves. To determine whether speed of burners which are alike is related to diameter, tests were made on standard and giant burners on the same stove. Data are shown in Table 5. With the exception of No. 8, the time required for heating the water was greater for the standard burners. The difference in time between Nos. 5 and 6 was less than between burners of other types; the difference in diameter is also less. The difference in time between Nos. 7 and 8 was in favor of the standard burner. This seeming inconsistency is due to the heavy grate over No. 8. When this burner was used with an open grate, it heated almost as rapidly as No. 13. No. 7 was used thruout the tests with an open grate. This burner was intended as an oven burner, but the oven was removed so that a standard burner on this stove might be studied. This ex - plains why burners on the same stove were used with dif - ferent grates. EFFECT OF HEIGHT OF FLAME ON TIME REQUIRED FOR HEATING OF LONG-CHIMNEY BURNERS Table 6 shows a comparison of long-chimney wick burners with flames at different heights. The difference in time for the "cold start" is almost 6 minutes in favor of the flame with yellow tips, and for the "hot start" it is over 4 minutes. Many persons using this type of burner are not aware that it can be burned with a higher flame and for this reason complain that it is slow. </seg>

After preliminary adjustment of the burner to give its maximum heating effect, the kerosene tank was removed, weighed, and replaced at the same instant that the water was placed over the burner. Distilled water at 25° C. (77° F.) initial temperature was used. The boiling temperature was determined. Also the time required for the water to heat from 25° C. to the boiling point and then to evaporate com - pletely was recorded. The instant evaporation was com - pleted, the kerosene tank was removed and reweighed.

In these tests the burner was fully heated at the start. When these facts are taken into consideration, the high thermal efficiency of the burner is of lessened significance.

With the exception of Nos. 7 and 8, evaporation time was less for the giant burners. The heavy grate over No. 8 explains the apparently lower evaporation speed of this burner. The oil consumption of the giant burners was higher in all cases than the standard, and the thermal efficiency was therefore lower. There was a greater difference in thermal efficiency between Nos. 7 and 8 than between the others. Apparently the heavy top over No. 8 lowers the thermal efficiency, since that over No. 7, used with an open top, was considerably higher than the other standard burners shown in this table, and as high as any of the same type (Table 9). These data show that increase in diameter of burners on the same stove increased oil consumption and therefore lowered thermal efficiency. OBSERVATIONS ON SOOT FORMATION Records were kept of the frequency of soot formation on the utensils used during all the tests. The data are shown in Table 12. </seg>

            <seg id="p028">A Study of Kerosene Cook Stoves of utensil used is an important factor in the performance of kerosene burners, and the effect upon the practical use of kerosene stoves, the following study was made. To compare the heating speed and thermal efficiencies of burners used with different-sized utensils, a series of pans with perpendicular sides, uniformly 3V£ inches deep, but varying in diameter, were constructed for use in testing the burners. It will be recalled that for all previous work in this study, aluminum pans were used. Because of the difficulty and expense of constructing aluminum pans suitable in shape and size, copper was used for the part of the study now under consideration. The diameters of the pans were as follows: 12 inches, 9.8 inches, 8.5 inches, 6 inches, 4.15 inches. To eliminate differences due to burner construction, giant and standard burners on the same stove were chosen on which to make the tests.

First, as diameter increases, from the smallest to the largest, the thermal efficiency increases rapidly at first, for the smaller diameters, and then less rapidly, and be - comes a maximum at the largest (12-inch) or next to the largest (9.8-inch) size. Where the burner was small (stand - ard), the maximum thermal efficiency was attained at a pan diameter of 9.8 inches; however, the increase in efficiency over that at 8.5 inches is not large. Where the burner was large (giant) , the highest thermal efficiency was obtained in these studies at the largest diameter. The maximum effic - iencies for giant burners is probably to be obtained with a somewhat larger pan. In half the cases, thermal efficiency was twice as high for the largest as for the smallest pan used. Second, as diameter increases, the time required to heat a unit quantity of water decreases, rapidly at first for the smaller diameter, then less rapidly and becomes a minimum at the largest or next to the largest diameter used.

It is to be observed that the relative performance of the different burners is very satisfactorily constant for the dif - ferent sizes of pans in some cases, but not in others. In those cases where the relative performance is not constant, the most erratic values were obtained with the smaller pans. In all cases the mean performance is close to that obtainable by an 8- to 10-inch pan. In Table 20 a comparison is shown of time of heating and thermal efficiency data obtained with 6%-inch aluminum pans, with the data obtained with copper pans as presented in Table 20. — The relative performance of kerosene burners when tested with aluminum and copper utensils Thermal efficiency Relative time of heating Burner per pound ct water Relative Absolute number Aluminum Copper Aluminum Copper Aluminum Copper pans'- pans pans 1 pans pans 1 pans 1 7 100.0 100.0 100.0. 100.0 33 34.9 8 78.0' 86.1 57.6' 93.0' 19&gt; 26.7= 12 93.2 89.0 69.7 79.0 ' 23 24.5 13 76.0 80.0 54.5 63.0 18 18.9 5 107.0 89.0 78.8 96.0 26 36.4 6 ' 103.3 85.0 75.8 91.0 25 26.7 3 106.6 127.0 100.0 101.0 33 33.7 9 111.4 100.0 84.9 104.0 28 ' 36.3 1 6 H-inch diameter.

The foods baked were placed as near the center as possible, on a grate, and a thermometer was used so that uniform temperatures could be obtained before placing food in the oven. The data showing time and cost of operation are shown in Table 21. The long-chimney burner and the short chimney with tsbestos lighting ring required less time than the other types, these burners differing only slightly. The wickless burner was slowest. With the exception of the long-chimney burner, which required the most, there was little difference in the amount of kerosene used. The ranking of the burners as to time and oil requirement, shown in Table 21, is fairly consistent with that for the same burners shown in Tables 3 and 4, and 9 and 10. In the previous studies, however, the long-chimney burner was more rapid than the short chimney with lighting ring. It should be kept in mind that determina - tions made as in the previous tables would be subject to fewer errors than those in the practical studies. The total costs of operation for the four burners in the cooking tests vary with the relative cost of wicks, lighting rings, and gasoline for priming the wickless burner. The total cost with the long-chimney wick burner was highest, and with the wick - less slightly less. It is probable that over a long period of time the long-chimney burner would vary little from the others in fuel consumption, since it is at full heat very soon after fighting. The other types require a longer time to reach full heat, arid in addition the wickless burner, which is the slowest, must be primed. Rather than wait to reheat a short chimney or a wickless burner, many persons would allow them to burn when not in use. The long-chimney burner is quickly and easily turned out and relighted. During a large number of cooking processes of short duration, there would probably be less tendency to waste oil with a long - chimney burner. The quality of foods cooked on the four types of burners was, on the whole, quite satisfactory. Vegetables, which re - quire high temperatures, were, on all types of burners, palat - able and attractive in appearance. Allowing for differences in original quality, steaks cooked on the different types of burners were more uniform in quality than meats requiring long cooking at lower temperatures. The types of burners varied in their capacity to maintain low-temperature cooking. On the wick burners with both long and short chimneys, the flame could be lowered sufficiently to maintain simmering heat. The flames of the short chimney with asbestos lighting </seg>

The product was more tender when cooked on the burners which could be easily and quickly adjusted for low heat. ' The short chimney with asbestos lighting ring was most difficult to adjust. It is probable that by using extra grates and asbestos pads under the cooking utensil, the heat could be regulated. However, the burner which can be ad - justed without additional pieces of equipment is more desir - able from the standpoint of the user. The difficulty of regulating temperature was again apparent in the use of the oven. Foods requiring quick baking at high temperatures, such as biscuits, muffins, cookies, and some pies, were of good quality, while loaf cakes and roasts, which require slow baking, were less desirable in quality. t5y the use of one burner, with the lighting-ring and wickless types, after the oven was heated, satisfactorily low oven tem - peratures were maintained, but there was always the disad - vantage of slow adjustment of flame in these burners </seg>
