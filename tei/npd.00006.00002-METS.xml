The best and surest way to decide which part of the land is best for cherries is by actual test. In the new and untried parts of the state, plant a few trees on each of the plats that would be convenient for a cherry orchard, and watch the results. In the older settled parts of the state, observe the successes and fail - ures of your neighbors who have planted on the different soils similar to your own, and note which location has given the best results, making due allowance for the care that each has re - ceived. The character of our soils varfes so widely in different parts of the state that it would be very difficult to give advice that would apply to all sections, but will do the best I can. In any part of our state where the soil and subsoil are of nd an even, deep, loose and moist nature as to be practically the same in all parts of the field, then the high land is best, as there is less danger of frosts. Again, other locations are of an even. hard clay that is more or less subject to drouth, and there the north slopes are the best. On the table lands many placet are underlaid with ''joint clay" from one to two feet in thickness. This clay is sometimes within a few inches of the surface, and in the wild state is usually covered with "QtUHH grass" and wild onions. In other places the joint clay stratum is a few feet be - low the surface, where the larger grasses and grains grow, and near the sloughs the joint clay seems to have no effect on the &lt;rops or is missing entirely. On this low land the cherry will mildew badly, and the trees are short-lived. On the higher lands where there is a few feet of black soil on top of the joint clay the cherry does fairly well, but in very wet seasons they are (9) </seg>
            <seg id="p011">10 NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. apt to show leaf-rust, and in very dry seasons they ripf the wood a little too early, which endangers the fruit-buds if th dry weather is followed by wet in the latter part of August an&lt; during the month of September. But on the high lands whei the joint clay comes near the surface are the best tktiiy l&lt;&gt;&lt;-&lt; tions. These patches dry very hard as deep as the joint &lt;la goes, but are always moist below it. The joint clay is of mm a nature that the cherry roots like to feed in it, or will ru F through and below it for moisture. These places do not freeze deep in winter, are the first to thaw out in spring, and are tl coolest in summer. It is here that we get the most regular crop of the finest fruit, and here the trees live longest. Along the Platte valley in many places the character of the soil for cherry growing is so vastly different that, judging from the lay of the land, the results seem to be just the opposite from what they are on the table lands. In Butler county, the ridges there are of a more sandy nature, and in very dry seasons the trees are apt to ripen their wood too early, and if followed by wet weather in the after part of the season there is danger of the sap starting to rise, which endangers the fruit-buds or even the life of the tree. In this locality the north slopes and swales ftp - pear to be the best, but where a loose, clay subsoil can be had. either on ridge or swale, it is the best for this locality. In some localities there is a gumbo clay underlying the surface soil. This is frequently several feet in thickness, and the roots of the trees will not penetrate it, but spread out on top of it. Under these conditions a season of wet or dry weather will affect the trees very quickly, and it is advisable to cut a hole entirely through the gumbo, fill it in with surface soil, well traniped down, and plant the tree over it. This enables the tree to root deep enough to procure a more regular supply of moisture. I will say in conclusion on character of soil that the general rule is to have the cherry orchard on as high land as you can and still get an even supply of moisture; that is, not too wet in the wet season, nor too dry in the dry ones. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">11 PLANTING AND CULTIVATION. To prepare the ground for planting, ground that has been in &lt; &lt;&gt;rn the previous year is in good condition, or if stubble land it should be plowed in the fall. In either case the ground should be marked out with a plow, making deep furrows fifteen feet — or the desired distance — apart. This should be done in the fall, plowing several times in the same furrow in order to pulverize the soil and subsoil at least twelve or "fifteen inches deep. Leave the furrows open so as to catch and retain the snow and rain that fall, thus thoroughly moistening the subsoil and giving the frost* of winter a chance to pulverize the clods. In the spring, by means of stakes, the rows can be run crosswise of the furrows - at the desired distance apart, planting the trees where those line* cross the furrows. If the ground is dry at planting time, use sufficient water to settle the soil well about the roots of the tree. &lt; PLANTING AND CULTIVATION OF THE CHERRY. A BY E. F. STEPHENS, CRETE. The proper planting and cultivation of the cherry must be governed to some extent by climate, soil, location. If in a humid climate, deep planting would favor the emission of sinkers, likely to be very troublesome. On the other hand, shallow plant - ing in our western and northwestern counties would involve losa from root killing. In the eastern counties of our state, where the soil is of the loess formation, expensive preparation is not necessary. Where we have the drift formation, a* in Saline and western Lancaster, with hard subsoil and occasional gumbo, careful preparation is desirable. In Saline county we plow in lands equal in width, to the distance apart decided on for planting. The dead furrows are arranged to come where row is to be planted; subsoil these dead furrows with six horses, ploughing </seg>
            <seg id="p013">12 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. a.8 deeply as possible. This furnishes a reservoir of moist soil under the row. Thoroughly pulverize with disc and harrow. Westward, as in north Kearney, Dawson, and Lincoln coun - ties, favorable subsoils are found and preparation is less ex - pensive. Depth of planting should in all cases be varied to allow settling of the soil. If the soil has been prepared to a •depth of from sixteen to eighteen inches of loose soil, which will settle at least four inches in compacting together, the planter will find his trees standing out of ground more than he intended. After the soil has settled the point at which the tree was budded should be two inches underground in river ■counties, three inches in Saline county, five or six inches in &lt;-&lt;'iitral and western counties. DMmm Mirecn tree* and plant*. — This is governed by avail - able moisture. If on dry table lands in western and central counties, the trees should be eighteen feet apart, that the smaller number of trees may divide the limited amount of mois - ture conserved by careful culture. Cherries have and can be grown on the Cheyenne county table lands on soil 200 feet to water. Under ditches in western Nebraska, and where by nat - ural subirrigation water stands within four to six feet of the surface, ample moisture allows closer planting, at the same time growing larger trees. Strong growers like Early Rich - mond use sixteen feet; English Morello has room at fourteen feet. In Saline we have less than needed moisture and should neleet most favorable locations, retentive of moisture. We have suffered from using rapidly sloping side hills, losing a percent - age of heavy showers and long continued rains. In Saline county fourteen to sixteen feet apart allows for movement of teams in cultivation. In commercial planting, some time is saved by cross-marking with a team. Four horses and a lister open furrows the other way and lessen the amount of spade work. If plenty of help van be had there is doubtless a little advantage in trimming the roots, before planting, removing bruised and tangled end* </seg>

We find the best success where trees are set with extreme solidity. Many failures follow loose planting. Forty odd years ago I turned a drill many days helping my father blast rooks; to guard against the charge blowing our. without rending the rock, father |g»pri around the fuse with broken, soft, dry brick; this held. Our preference is to tamp the soil firmly to the roots of the trees, later thoroughly sat - urate the soil. Under ditches this is done by allowing water not to Hood but to seep in and saturate the soil. On our table lands leave a basin and use thirty quarts of water to each tree; after soaking away, cover with loose soil. Trimming the tree. — For our commercial orchards we trim our trees before they are sent out — a large share of them before they are dug; cut each branch back to two or three buds, which lessens evaporation and secures More branches. Protect the trunk of the tree with paper, cloth, veneers, or cornstalks. Sixty-pound granite paper answers very well; cut in strips four inches wide, thirty-six inches long; wind spirally, tie. A man may cool hi— ell by immersing his arms in water; the tiee absorbs but little water until granulations have been formed and cell growth begun. The tree depends almost wholly on what it has stored in root, trunk, and bark. We should lessen evaporation and save the tree from loss by extreme care during its transition from the nursery to the orchard row and for two to four weeks thereafter. Ordinarily commercial care cannot prevent some loss during this transition period. After-trimmimg is to eat out branches that cross — to shorten in rank leaders — to develop as many branches as possible — to keep the head very low and broad, and most of the fruit within eight feet of the ground. Trees with few branches cannot carry maximum crops, l'ropeily trimmed and grown, should yield thirty t.o forty-live quarts in sixth year; three to three and one half bushels ten years from planting. Tarefully cultivated. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">14 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY broad, low-branched trees should do full work up to eighteen rears. Cultivation. — To save expense, corn or vegetables may be grown in the cherry orchard for two years, but it will be at expense of later crops unless there is command of ample mois - ture and plenty of manure. Would prefer to cultivate frequently with reversible disc and harrow alternated. These may be run until mid-August, twelve to fourteen cultivations for the season. The cherry tree is quite likely to ripen wood early even with frequent and late cultivation. It is also benefited by surface manuring. Our best cherry orchard of three hundred trees had hundreds of bushels of straw stack ashes. When trees are too large to cultivate closely we have found benefit from partial mulch of stable litter spread on the surface. The cherry in full bearing can use a large amount of manure spread on surface and leached in. I do not remember to have ever seen a cherry tree of full bearing age that had more manure than it could safely use. After trees have been six years planted we have made use of straw to mulch the entire row six feet in width, cultivating the middle spaces between the rows one way only. This combination retains moisture and appar - ently guards against roots forming too near the surface. When the orchard attains full bearing; a heavy crop exhausts the tree; the tramping of the pickers pack the soil, and during especially fruitful years, unless cultivation is very thorough and persistt-nt from June to middle August or September, the cherry tree is likely to exhause itself and to decline in vigor; sometimes dies soon after yielding an excessive crop in a dry year. Not infrequently the orchardist is also a farmer, and, busy with the rush of grain harvest or the care of other farm crops, he neglects to give good cultivation to his thrifty, productive, cherry orchard, thinking, from its fine appearance and the char - acter of the weather, cultivation may not be necessary. Weed growth, rapidly evaporated moisture, and the exhaustion inci - dent to the production of. a full crop, all together rapidly exhaust </seg>

Sometimes we have a dry autumn followed by a dry winter, with the result that the following season the trees fail to put forth with their accustomed vigor, and some times die outright. The cherry is so easily grown that even with much less than needed care, and in spite of improper handling and lack of cul - tivation, more farmers succeed with the cherry than with any other fruit. The cherry gives full returns in spite of neglect; it responds generously to full cultivation, judicious application of fertilizers, and to such care and treatment as the planter should give. The size and quality of the fruit is largely under the control of the planter. He may have the best if he will put forth propet effort. It is so easily grown that every household should have access to a suitable number of trees. The differ eace between choice, well-ripened fruit fresh from the tree, and that often offered in the market, is very wide. Mi:. Haktley: I should like to ask Mr. Stephens if he doe* anything to prevent wash during clean cultivation, and if so, what? I find the roots of my trees gettipg out of the ground. Mh. Stephens: I regret to say that is one of the trouble* which besets us where orchards are planted on rolling land. If you practice frequent shallow cultivation for the purpose of retaining moisture, you will have trouble from washing by heavy rains, either dashing thunder showers, or long-continued rains. Mr. Walker thinks it is sometimes necessary to interrupt this continuous shallow, loose culture and plow the land, leaving the furrows somewhat rough; or, if possible, plow coarse furrows. Mulching is another way to guard against washing. In fact. I think mulching is one of the best things we can do. Mb. Yager: Do you think it is necessary to mix the varieties of cherries in order to insure perfect fertilization of the blos - soms, as in the case of plums and some other fruits? Mr. Stephens: Our experience would not indicate that the » 1'isi-rssiON. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">16 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OCIETY. leading varieties of cherries need to be treated in that way. We have one variety which is a very strong grower and free bloomer, but most of the blossoms drop without developing fruit. The cherry is of excellent quality when it does bear. We are not positive about the name of this variety; we have sent specimens to Prof. Budd and others for name, but with unsat - isfactory results. This variety seems to fail in pollenization in some way. Question: What is the advantage of that paper wrapping of which you speak in your paper? Mr. Stephens : Especially in commercial planting it is de sirable to get the largest possible percentage of stand the first year, hence we should lessen the burden of the tree by even possible method. The evaporation the first few weeks aftei planting, before the roots get hold of the soil, is very trying t&lt; the tree, and if we can protect the trunk from the sun. lessei the evaporation and preserve the moisture stored in the trunk and branches, the trees are more likely to start off and grow without loss. Mr. Harris: Have you ever tried not cultivating at all, keep - ing the weeds mowed say two or three times a year? Mr. Stephens: I think that would depend very largely on the soil. I Mr. Harris: My trees have done better the last three or four ears since I quit cultivating than ever before; they have made better growth and produced more fruit. Mr. Stephens: What is your soil? Mr. Harris: It is clay; the'subsoil is miped with sand Mr. Stephens: I think in discussing the proper methods of handling trees or shrubs of any kind we must take into consider ation the soil and its ability to retain moisture. There is such a wide difference in different parts of the state that unless we IK very careful about locations we may confuse those who are seeking information. While it may be all right for Mr. Harris to allow the weeds to grow in his orchard, I doubt if it would </seg>

And as von go on to the central and western por tions of the state the loss of moisture by evaporation is so great I hat you must guard very carefully against loss of moisture by freed growth, or any loss that can be guarded against. VARIETIES HEKT ADAPTED TO NEBRASKA. BY W. It. HAKUIS, TKCIMSKH. .1/;-. Pmiiemi, ami Member* of the HmUcnltmrml 8*eietf: It is vith much pleasure that I am permitted to Ik- with you again Her an absence of six years. I have had the pleasure of visiting nanv orchards in a number of the states, and far southward K-low the frost line where fruit will grow the year round with mt verv little labor from man. Hut when we sum up all the dvantages of location, soil, market, and profit for the grower, Nebraska stands about as well as most other places. The climate, soil, location, and the kinds of fruits we grow ire matters of taste, after all, just like the company we keep and the clothes we wear. Taste has more to do with us than re are willing to admit. The fruit grower that makes a specialty &gt;f a certain variety of fruit will do more to develop that par - icular kind. Most of the other fruits have be— sj**cialized hv some one in Nebraska, but cherry. We seem to be satistied with he varieties we now have, as I know of no one making a spec - alty of it here, while we have live or six hundred varieties to elect from. Those varieties that have proven successful have paid the grower a handsome profit. I have one hundred trees that have netted me (1.50 per tree for the last three years. The cherry has proven as profitable as any fruit I grow. Out of the thirty varieties that I have only three of them would I grow for profit. Taking them in order as they ripen 2 </seg>

The Oliver does not come into bearing very early, hut when we do net a crop it is the best seller we have. It simplv sells on night. The Empress Eugenia is also a fine cherry, fairly productive, high quality, tree dwarf in growth and abun dant in foliage. I think it would be tender in the north part of the state. I have lost faith in the Russian cherry, except one variety that came in a lot received from Prof. IJi'.dd. It was without label and I do not know whether it is a Kussian or not. It ripens ten days to two weeks later than Early Richmond, looks very much like the Richmond in form and leaf. It is a wonder ful bearer. The tree for the last three years has been loaded with fruit. It has somewhat the astringency of the choke cherry until fully ripe, then it disap]&gt;ears. It will certainly make .1 fine market variety. DISCUSSION Mb. Yoinuers: What sj&gt;ecial advantage has that variety you obtained from Prof. Kudd over the Montmorency? It ripens at practically the same time, and it seems to me there would be BO advantage in planting it, or recommending it for planting. Mr. Harris: It will stand shipping a little better than the Montmorency, and will bear more fruit to the tree; it ripens about the same time. A. .1. Bbowx: Are you familiar with the Montmorency Ordi naire? Mr. Harris: No; I don't know that I am. Mr. Bbowx: It occurred to me that that might be the cherry you have; it answers the description very well. Mr. Harris: The old standard French Montmorency is not a very good bearer in this country. I believe I have a few trees of that variety. But the one introduced by Elwanger &amp; Harry a number of years ago is what I have; it is called the Large Montmorencv. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">19 f'HEHRIES BEST ADAPTED TO NEBRASKA. H. S. Harrison: I have om* criticism in regard to this sub - ject. .My experience has ban that the Large Moutmorency out - ranks any other cherry that we have had any experience with in our section fifty Miles west of licrc. My experience with and observation of the iheilj have been from York west. 1 have obietTcd the cherry very carefully in that section of country the past season, and I know that the Montinorency has not winter - killed nearly as had as either the Early Richmond or the .Morello. It has l&gt;een I he most regular and prolific bearer of any variety that we have had any experience with. It is a more thrifty, vigorous growing tree, and has, in my judg - ment, all the points to recommend it as being the best variety in our section. I may be an extremist on this point, but if I were going to plant a commercial cherry orchard of 1,O(MI trees, I should plant !»!»!» of them Large Montinorency. Mu, Bbown: What would you plant for the other one? 1Kb. ELUUUMMI: Well. I believe for the other one I should plant lontmorency. [Laaghter.] 1 think this is the most important iject that is likely to come up at this meeting. The cherry is ■eminently the tree that is adapted to the western part of • state. It is about the ouly fruit tree that they can grow •cessfully here, and I would like to see this society go on rec - l as to the best variety. The only argument used against • cherry tree is that it winter-killed last winter. It went •ough three years of drouth; anil I want to say that so far as observation has gone the Montnioreiicy did not winterkill all last winter, and it has always been a prolitic bearer. filit. Young ns: Would you wish to place yourself on record planting and recommending only one variety of cherry? I Slit. IIaukison: I may have been using a little strong language, t I wanted to emphasize the fact that the Montinorency is, my opinion, the best cherry for Nebraska. EIn. YiuxiiKus: Would yon advise others to plant only the ntmoremv and have cherries only daring the season of that ' varietv? </seg>
            <seg id="p021">20 NRRRASKA STATE HOftTiri'LTrtlAL SOCIETY. Mil. Harrison: Tho ripening season of the Montmorency is peculiarly adapted to our climate. It comes in later than the Richmond, so the late frosts d&lt;&gt; not affect it, and it is enough ahead of the late varieties so that it is out of the way of the July drouth, which usually catches the late varieties out in the western portion of the state. J. A. Yacseh: This bring! up again the same old question of the adaptation of certain varieties to certain localities. With us, fifty miles north of this, the English Morello and the Early Richmond take the lead over the Montmorency, and I think it is simply a question of certain varieties being adapted to certain localities. I think it is just as much so with the cherry as it is with other fruits. Tiik I'kksidknt: Where would you place the Montinorency as to its relative value? Mit. Yauku: 1 would place it third in the list. Mit. Harrison: It i» a fact that the Montmorency does not hear heavily as young as the other varieties, hut if you will wait for it you will find that it will l&gt;ear heavier and last longer than any other cherry on earth. L. (&gt;. Williams: I should like to second Mr. Harrison's championship of the Montmorency cherry. My e.\]&gt;erience, reaching back over a jteriod of twenty years, has shown that variety to be the most enduring and successful tree of any that I have tried. At Council Bluffs, my old home, I had an orchard of several hundred trees, and the Montmorency was the l&gt;est and thrift it-wt tree I had. It has the ability to withstand trying conditions. For instance, we had a hailstorm there after my lues had been planted rive or six years which destroyed many of the trees, and at that time the Large Montmorency was the only row that preserved an unbroken line. Hen' in Nebraska, esjMMially in the western part of the state, there are sections of country that are particularly liable to hailstorms. This tree has an upright, compact" head, which enables it to withstand such storms belter than Ihe average tree. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">21 • 'HERKIK8 BEST ADAITKI' in N Last Hprinj; I planted on the Waftsea Ranch at Kearney live thousand cherry trees in a solid body. Mj selection of varieties was Montmorency and 1,000 each of Early Richmond, Knjjlish Morello. and Wragg. While this election was not adhered to strictly in tilling the order, the results bore me out in my selection. The Montmorencv made the best percentage of stand by far, there being only 16 pet cent of loss under MM quite trying circumstances. The Karly Richmond came next, while the later varieties were the heaviest losers. The Mont - niorency seems to at once adapt itself to the changed conditions when transplanted; seems to take right hold and grow from the start. It thus makes a better stand to begin with, and I am satisfied it makes a more enduring tree. I realize, as has beta suggested, that it is not best to put "all your eggs in one basket," so I should not plant exclusively of any one variety of cherries, but I should make the Montmorencv the leader; plant, say, one - half Montmorency, and then one fourth each of the early and late varieties. The Montmorency is a very desirable cherry for canning; if you should have a surplus of them in your orchard at fruiting time you can can them. E. T. IIauti.ky: Of the seven varieties of cherries that I have the Montmorency has suffered the most during the winter. There is scarcely a single specimen among the Monfinorency trees that does not show winter injury. With that exception I would corroborate the views already expressed in regard to the Montmorency. at the same time cautioning members against the confusion of names. The cherry is sold as the Large Mont - morency. the Montmorency Ordinaire, and Montmoieiicy Estra - ordinaire. I&gt;oubtless a good deal has been said of the Mont - morency, using names that did not apply. We are told by many that the Montinoreiicy Ordinaire is much the best cherry of the three, but it would probably puzzle every nurseryman here now to tell whether he has the Large Moiitinorencv or the Mont morency Ordinaire. In regard to the stand of trees, my stand among the Lane Montmorency was 100 jhm- cent, which I can- </seg>

Harris: How is the growth as compared with the Olivet? Jlii. Hartley: They grow very much more rapidly than the Olivet. Mh. Hakims: My Olivet makes the best growth of any variety I have. From my experience with the three varieties — Early Richmond, Montinorency and English Moretta — it seems to me that it would not do to drop either of them. For an early cherry, of course the Dyehouse comes in a little earlier that the Early Richmond, but it is a very tender cherry ami one that could not be shipped any distance at all; it will melt down in half a day. almost, when fully ripe. Ry planting the Early Richmond, Montinorency. and English Morello you have a cherry season of about six weeks. The Montinorency is the best seller because it comes in between the early and late cherries, and there are very few growing the Montinorency iu our part of the country. We have never been able to supply the market, but it is a poor ■Upper. It is a thin-skinned cherry and will turn dark iu keeping over Bight when fully ripe unless it is put in cold stor age. Mh. Harrison: Our experience has been that when the Early Richmond sells for $1 a bushel the Large Montinorency always brings fl."&gt;0 on the market. H. F. McInposh : From the consumer's standpoint I rise to say that in our family we never buy cherries for canning or preserving except the Montinorency. We never buy the English Morello because it is a little thing with a very large seed. In the half-developed condition in which it comes into market usu - ally there is nothing of it but "skin and bones." and it is not a desirable cherry for the consumer. On the farms where you grow it to a dead ripe condition before gathering and can use it immediately, it is all right. We used to find it so on our farm, but for market conditions it does not fill the bill for economical |H'ople. </seg>

I suppose the intention of the committee on prografnme was for me to discuss the best mode of propagation and the good and bad qualities of the various roots that the different varieties of the plum is worked on. I wish to say, in the beginning, that there is no variety of stocks in existence that is entirely satisfactory. The seedlings of our native plums are perfectly hardy and would be satis factory but for their everlasting sprouting, which lias brought them into disfavor, and they seem to have been buried in the grave of despair, never again to be resurrected. The M yrobolan (a French seedling) in most universally used and gives the best general satisfaction. It will unite readily with almost any vari - ety and furnishes abundant sap for good, thrifty growth, the only objection being that it is a little tender — almost or quite as tender as the j&gt;each. However, it will take good care of the tree for some fifteen or eighteen years, which is about the life of the European varieties, and is as long as the natives are really profitable, as older trees of the Americanas, unless under extra care, will almost universally produce inferior fruit which is unmarketable and not at all desirable for home use; and as they begin to bear at the early age of three or four years, the best fruit growers discard the old trees and replace them bv </seg>

I do not know the length of the Mariana's life, but feel sure that it will do service longer than the Myrobolan. It stood last winter's trying freezing much better than the Myrobolan. and we all agree that it was a test winter on tree* roots. The Americanas aud .Japans seem to do better on it than the Europeans. The peach sidling furnishes a very good root for the Chickasaws and Japans and a few varieties of the other Ainericanas and Europeans, and as the peach root will li\ long as the Japans and as long as the Chickasaws will do good service, these varieties' time of usefulness is not really cut short by being on peach roots. The young peach roots stood last winter's test in nursery row as well as the Mariana or natives and much better than Myrobolan and apple seedlings of same age. In fact the peach root is much hardier than the top, and hardier than most people would suppose, and its extremely nappy growth feeds the tree so well that it puts on a hand— j growth and appearance anA the fruit is larger and finer than on any other root. Therefore, in considering the subject of plum stocks or roots, it resolves itself into about the following: If you want hardiness, regardless of .sprouts or anything else, the native seedling is the best ; if you prefer a tree that will not Ikpmut. do good service while young, aud die before very old, then use one of the other three. They will be found to unit' ter if- divided about as follows: For the peach root, use the Chickasaws, that is. Wild Qooae, Pottawattamie, etc. The Japans, and in fact the Miner, Wolf, and Wyant, and a few of the Kuroi&gt;eans, make a good union on the peach. For the Mariana root use the Americanas; also the Chickasaws and Japans unite readily. The Europeans have not done so well, yet am not ready to say they are not a success on the Mariana.

VARIETIES OF PLUMS REST ADAPTED To NEBRASKA. BY 1. A. YAGEK, FREMONT. Some years ago it occurred to me that with all our enthusiast about apples, cherries, peaches, and other fruits, the culture «&gt; the p] mil had been neglected. Since that time I have been mot - or less engaged in growing this fruit with varying results. T be frank with you, I must admit that I have always had a tende spot for the plum, since it fell to my lot to spend my yout near one of the most extensive and varird plum thickets i Nebraska. Father said certainly Providence had favored u by giving us this natural fruit. Of these wild plums there wet many kinds, varying, of course, in quality, size, color, and se; son, but they suplied us with fruit at that time not otherwis obtainable. However, this peaceful satisfaction was of a shor duration, for a tree man appeared about that time, and froi </seg>

He told father iveiv court dentially) that he was authorized to sell only six trees to any one person, but if he would guard the secret from his neighbors, he would sail him two dozen for fl'O. This' teemed our oppor - tunity to make the desert blossom as the rose; the order was given; the trees came, were planted, and— died? No; four of them lived and bore many large black knots, but no plums. This happened when I was a boy and was one of my primary lessons in horticulture. Hut in the light of maturer years 1 that the trouble lay in trying to grow plums not adapted to our Nebraska soil and climate. In view of the fact that this is a large state, having a dive: of soil, temperatnre, and rainfall, the difficulty of naming vari eties adapted to all parts of the state is at once apparent. After a somewhat extended correspondence with men who grow plums, and a careful perusal of horticultural books and papers, I have been impressed with the fact that the proper selection of varie - ties is to be determined largely by local conditions. It is a well known fact that there are several hundred varieties of plums from which we may make our selection. Baring little botanical knowledge I will not undertake to classify these, but in coin mon parlance we have the American or native, the European, and the .Japanese. We all know that there have been thousands of foreign plums planted in Nebraska. We also know that in most instances they have proved a failure. Hut if, in making thin statement, the men who hair succeeded with them, and the places irhvir they have succeeded are brought to light, one of the purposes for which this panel was written will have accomplished. Of course now and then in some specially fa \ored spot we find a tree that has borne fruit, but as a rule I deem them unprofitable both for commercial and home use. To the average planter the beanty, size, and keeping qualities of these plums have lx&gt;eu an inducement to grow them. While </seg>
            <seg id="p029">28 ri EBRA8KA STATE HOKPM T.LIl KAL SOC'I KT x . it i8 well to swk these qualities, others of greater LmportABce must not be sacrificed to obtain them. It seems to me that while we should not exclude the good varieties that come to us from Europe and Japan, and should not overlook their excel - lent quality, yet our main reliance in the future would be on American sorts. The principal points to be considered in selecting varieties are hardiness, productiveness, quality, size, and season of bloom - ing and ripening. The most important is hardiness; you cannot raise plums on dead, dying, or unhealthy trees. The American plums have shown their ability to resist the rigors of our cli - mate, which cannot be said of foreign plums. Next in impor - tance (especially for commercial planting) is productiveness. I think I may say, without danger of successful contradiction, that up to date we have been able to produce bushels of native plums to dozens of foreign ones, tree for tree. No many people say, "Oh, I don't want to plant trees that produce those red and yellow plums; I want big blue and green ones.'' But a few years later they come back and buy these once despised plums to fill their preserve jars and fruit bottles, awaiting the time when their superior plums will come into bearing. In point of quality the Americans compare favorably with the Europeans. Of course each kind has its individual merits; some are better for eating from the hand, some for canning, some for jelly. et&lt; In size we must concede that the foreign plums excel. As to th seasons of blooming and ripening, I cannot too strongly in press upon you the importance of planting kinds which blosson at about- the same period in order to insure fertilization. Righ here is where many fail in plum culture. Also plant varietie covering as long a period of ripening as possible. A good pla to increase your yield of fruit is to plant a colony of bees amon your trees. Perhaps it may not be amiss at this point to give you some of my personal experience, for experience is our best teacher. In the spring of 1888 J planted a small family plum orchard. </seg>

The «e - lection proved a fortunate one — Wild Goose and Miner planted alternately in the row. These trees began bearing enough for home use in abont five years, and doubtless would have done so sooner had they received proper tillage. In the yearn IW (the latter being a poor fruit year) these trees netted me |. r i \*-r tree each year. In 1894 I set out an orchard of about 4(M) trees one year old of the following varieties: Wild (loose, Pottawat - tamie, De Soto, Forest Garden, Wyant, Wolf, and Miner. In 18M the Pottawattamie yielded enough for home use. and in 18V? 125 bushels of plums were sold from this orchard at an average of f 1 per bushel, while in MM the crop was :?2."&gt; bushels. Including fifty bushels sent to the Trans Mississippi Ex|H&gt;sition, these plums averaged fl.31 per bushel. The crop of 1 *!•!&gt; wo lighter, owing to heavy winds before the fruit matured, and to the prevalence of plum {Kxket earlier in the season. The crop, however, was 196 bushels, which sold at fl.24 per bushel. This gives a total of f8&amp;{.75 realized from this orchard in the first time years of its bearing. I consider this sufficient proof that the varieties planted were adopted to my soil. Since ls«.»4 I have planted a number of Euroj&gt;ean and Japanese varieties for experimental purposes, and let me say that so far I have had more experience than plums. Last year I planted a new orchard of ;?&lt;M) trees of the following sorts: Hawkeye, Stoddard, Cbeney, Weaver, Kockford, Forest (Jarden, De Soto, Wyant, and Wolf. It is m,v belief, from all the information that I have been able to gather, that wherever in Nebraska plums have been grown it is safe to plant Wild Goose, ]&gt;e Soto, Forest Garden, Wyant. Miser, and probably Pottawattamie. Rut further than this each planter must be guided by local exj&gt;erien&lt;e and inquiry. The above list is a good one. including as it does plums of fair sixe and good quality, which ripen from the middle of July to the middle of September. For detailed description of the above recommended varieties, I would refer you to E. T. Hart paper, "Plums for Profit," in the IMS Horticultural Report. </seg>

Bay your trees of some nurseryman whom you know - to he reliable, or you may have the experience that I had in Betting out my first winter Apple orchard. Some twelve years ago I selected five kinds that I knew did well in my locality, and Keren years later nearly all of them bore the tinest Whitney crabs I ever saw. This was a remarkable "bud variation," but Darwin sjwaks of such freaks in his "Origin of Species." Mr. Pollard: I should like to ask the gentleman which variety he considers the best table plum? Mit. Y.vjku: The best plum to eat out of the hand is the Wyant; also for canning. It is a large plum, hardy, a perfect freestone, and has that peculiar "peachy" flavor. It cannot be beaten so far as I know. I also have greal hopes of the Stod (lard; I believe it is pting to be one of the best plums in our state. It is hardy, very larfje, and productive. Mr. Hodghs: Is there any" difference between the Stoddard and the llawk&lt; \ Mr. Ya&lt;;er: Oh yes; the Stoddard is a much larger plum than the Hawkeye. It is a dark red plum, as dark or darker than the Wild (loose, while the Hawkeye has something of a dirty, bluish tint; I don't know how to describe it. Mr. Hodgm: I have the Ilawkeye which I obtained from II. A. Terry, and the Stoddard. received from Mr. Wragg. They are both in bearing and 1 can't tell any difference in the trees or fruit. Mu. Yaobs: They are both bearing in our locality in Dodge county, and the Stoddard is a much larger and better plum than the Ilawkeye. Mr. Cuaiari: The Pottawattamie is naturally rather small and it has a tendency, like the Genet apple, to overbear and thus exhause its vitality and decrease in size. It is one of the kinds that bear early and too much; that is the tendency of the plum. DISCUSSION </seg>
            <seg id="p032">31 PLUMB HEST ADAPTED TO NEBRASKA. Mr. Haruis&lt;&gt;n: Have you ever tried thinning them? Mil, Christy: Yes 1 have tried that, but i.t is the hardest plum there is to thin. If you attempt to thin them at all you an - liable to shake them all off. The only way to do it just right is to pick them off by hand, and life is too short for that. Mil. Harris: I should like to ask Mr. Yager if he has tried the Milton. Mr. Yager: Yes, I have tried the Milton. In ■pfking of the comparative earliness of plums, someone has said that the Milton is fifteen minutes earlier than the Wild Qoow in ripen - ing. I think that is about correct. Mr. Harris: With me it is five or six days earlier, and all ripens at once; you can nether all of the fruit within five or six daysaifter it nets rijte.

Mr. Hodges: Does the Wyant grow successfully in the north en part of the state? Mr. Yager: Yes sir; the Wyant is perfectly hardy. There is one thing about our plums that I think has been overlooked somewhat. I think in making our selection of plums we should pay some attention to the root upon which they are budded. 1 don't know what these professional people think about it, but I have a theory that putting a hardy top on a tender root will </seg>

SuriETV. iecreaae the hardiness of the top; aim* that the opposite of that would be true — that patting a tender top on a hardy root would decrease the hardiness of the root. I think we ought to look somewhat to the hardiness of the root on which we are patting the top. Mr. Harrison: What stock do you use? Mr. Ya&lt;;kr: 1 have used several — the Mariana, Myrobolan, peach, and some natives. The last named is the lx*st stock if we don't care about suckers. I think plums budded on the Mariana will bear a little earlier than those on any other stock. Mr. LoKGCDOar: I heartily endorse the views of the gentle - man in regard to the kinds of plains best adapted to this state — that is. the American gtoap — also the varieties named, largely. The Wyant is certainly a tine plum, although in quality I do not think it as good as some others. I have but one Wyant tree large enough to bear any considerable amount, and it is in a somewhat isolated location. Two years ago the tree bloomed very freely, but for some cause did not set much fruit. Last year the same tree came out with an abundance of bloom and 1 resolved to try a little experiment on it. I watched it very closely, and just at the right time I took a branch (j-oin a seed - ling Miner coming into blossom at exactly the same season as the Wyant. inserted the wood in the mouth of a bottle contain - ing a pint of water, and placed it in the center of the top of the Wyant tree. The water was replenished from day to day, the little branch blossomed out to the very last, and actually showed signs of letting quite a lot of fruit. Whether the crop received from that tree was the result of that experiment or not I don't know, but the fact is I got as nice a crop of plums as I ever saw on a tree, although on account of being so heavily loaded the plums were not quite as large as they should have been. Mr. Ya&lt;:kr: There is one other point that I should like to mention for the benefit of prospective planters, and that is the selection of a location for the plum on-hard. You should always choose low. rich soil if you have any; if you haven't, make it just </seg>

If you want big plums of nice color, and lots of them. en rich vour soil. Put your plums in the lowest places when* (he rich alluvial soil is. Mh. IlAitKiso.v: I think possibly Mr. Yager ia more prejudiced against the Japanese plums than he would otherwise be from the fact that he has planted on bottom land. I have seen Jap anese plums in the extreme western part of the state that went through last winter without winter-killing. I have seen the Hm bank bearing as far west as I'helps county, and I think there ia something in that idea that the Japanese plum docs better further west where there ia not so much moisture. It makes a more sluggish growth, bean better, and is not so liable to winter injury. Mh. Hauti.ey: The facts do not bear out that theorv. The Japanese plums have done well in New York, where they have probably twice the moisture that we have. I have seen nothing in the Japanese plums that would indicate that they do not need as much moisture as other plums. They doubtless need a well-drained soil; not a heavy clay soil. They are more liable to winter injury; that I know to be the fact. I have planted about two hundred of them; have tried them on high ground and low ground; on rich bottom ground, and on ground that had a good mixture of sand; in other wards, I have them under four or five different conditions as to soil, and they have not done well in any of them. Last yejir they killed alike, whether on the bottom land or on the hill. It is quite likely that the culti - vation was kept up too late in view of the unprecedented winter which followed; it is quite likely that it would have been better to have allowed more for insurance against such a winter than I did, but the fact remains that the Japanese plums are about as tender as the average peach that we plant. In fact. I think we have peaches that are hardier than any of the Japanese ])lums, unless you except the Willard, which is not strictly a Japanese.

Hahti.ey: How is the skin — thick or thin? Mil. Ya&lt;;kk: The skin is thick — something like the Miner. Mr. Hahti.ky: How is it as to aatriagency? Mil. Yacek: It is a better plum in that respect than the Hawk eye. Mr. Hartley: How about staying on the tree until fully ripe? Mr. Yackk: It conies off more easily than the Hawkeve. Mb. Hartley: How is the tree — larger or smaller? Mr. Ya&lt;;er: It is a more ragged grower than the Hawkeve. Mr. Hartley: Do they split down, either of them? Mr. Ya&lt;;er: Not anything like the Forest Karden; it stands up veil in that respect. Mil. Hartley (continuing): With lefereiice io the Wyant, it is about the slowest grower I have, and a goad deal of the growth it does make is so irregular that it has to be continually cut back to keep it iu proper shape. There is no other plum that requires one-half the pruning that the Wyant dues, and in spite of everything it is a sight to behold. With regard to the quality of the Wyant. it has one serious objection, that is. the astriag - ency. or strong taste. There is as much difference between the Wyant and the Forest Gardes as there is between a first rale Havanna cigar and what we call a "«togj." Those who like strong tobacco would rate the Wyant very high; those who prefer something milder would prefer something else for quality. It is not, however, a true freestone; it is only semi-free, and is •to classed bv our l«&gt;st authorities. </seg>

It is about a week later than the Wyant, fully as large, and more nearly a freestone. I don't know any name for it except the Wiikcninn. It originated in Kansas. A man by the name of Kinkaid found it about twenty -five years ago growlBg wild; he took it up and took it to the place of his son in law where he was living, and planted it.

Mr. Prrnidmt, and Ladies and Gentlemen of the Xchranka Ht&gt;ttr Horticultural Society: After having the location or site for my plum orchard selected, and the varieties to plant decided ujmiii. the next thing will be the selection of some trees that have been propagated in the best manner and on the best stocks for this climate for hardiness and productiveness. This will have to be decided by the knowledge of the purchaser, or by the reconi mendation of the nurseryman or salesman from whom the frees are procured. Borne will prefer the trees propagated on the Myrobolam, some on the Mariana, and some on the native plum stocks. The first two are deemed by some to be too tender to endure the rigors of our Nebraska climate, while others prefer them from the simple faci that they do not sprout from the roots — a characteristic which is so objectionable in our native plum stocks. On whatever line of propagation may be decided, I should 1m' very careful to have a perfect union of stock and scion. or bud. and a well grown tree not more than two years old from the bud or graft as the case may Ih\ well proj&gt;ortioned, with trunk or body from one to two feet long. </seg>

Khould the trees be received in a somewhat dried condi - tion, as is often the case, the roots should be carefully puddled with soft mud, having the l&gt;ody of the tree in nearly a horizontal position and covered with something which will prevent as much as possible the evaporation caused by the action of t he sun and wind. They should remain in this position from one to three days, or until they assume a plump and natural appearance. The tree should be taken from the trench or puddle and carefully placed in the hole in an upright position with its roots straight - ened out in a natural position, and fresh earth carefully and firmly packed among them until the hole is nearly filled. This should be well finned and the top filled in with loose earth, and the planting may be considered finished. The proper cultivation of tie plum orchard consists — as in all other branches of orcharding — in thorough cultivation of the soil with a view to the conservation in the soil, for the use of the tree while the crop of fruit is growing and maturing, all of the moisture possible. Yet one of the most important con - siderations in order to secure a good crop of choice fruit de - pends on the good judgment used in properly thinning the fruit while quite small and before the vitality of the tree is exhausted on a much larger number of si&gt;eciniens than it can properly de velop to a desirable size and quality. The question of the vitality or vigor of the tree may depend quite as much on not allowing it to be overtaxed in an effort to mature too many specimens of fruit, as on the thorough fertilization and cultivation of the soil. And when both of these matters are carefully attended to, with a little judicious cutting out of the dry or dead branches, the life of your orchard may be extended far beyond its usual period &gt;- </seg>

Mr. I'lTxidrnt, LmMn nml QmtOtmm: I am very j^lad to have the opportunity of briagiag before tin* Society and the people of Iliis part of the state a question that I have had in mind for a good while as to whether or not the forest areas — the forest patches, the timber lands — are naturally spreading in this state. Iu order to prepare for the discussion of the question, let me give you a few facts with regard to tin* timber lands of our state. If you go east you tind that the entire ground was formerly cov - ered with timber, and from this a good many people got the idea that the natural covering of the ground every place wa» timber. Dr. Gray, the great botanist, some years ago sharply called people to account in this matter. He said it was an as sumption only that the world is naturally covered with trees lie says the fact is that trees are things that come in and cover the ground, and are not necessarily the natural covering. Where are our trees here in Nebraska? They are along the streams they are near the water. If we had before us a map of Ne braska we should find that the native timber of the state is heaviest in the southeastern part of the state, and that as you I ass away from the southeast corner in any direction into the state, the timber gradually grows les« and less. There are more kinds of trees the nearer you get to the corner ot braska, and the kinds you find in the extreme corner of the state, in Richardson county, are the same kinds that you will find if you go right on down the river. There is a part of botany called "g«*ographical botany." in which we take up the question •Stenographic r«*|&gt;ort of an address given without notes. In prepar - ing 1 it for publication it has been very slightly changed from the sten - ographer^ notes. This will account for the free treatment and loose construction. • </seg>

The raphical botany of the forest trees of Nebraska shows with - out question that the forests of eastern Nebraska are simply extensions of the forests of northern Missouri. Take our white oaks; they extend probably a little farther north than the point where we now are, but if you travel west you soon come to where there art- no white oaks, while if you go southeast you run ri}. r ht into the white oak forests. The common shell-bark hickory only comes into the state a little distance, while if you go down into .Missouri you will find it to be abundant. So if you were to make a map showing where the different kinds of trees are found, you would simply have to make curves showing that a certain kind only comes up so far, another a little farther, and so on. So it is an established fact that the trees of eastern Nebraska have come in at this corner of the state. If you ask when they came, I must answer, "I don't know." They have been bete, ■one of them, a many hundred years. How lonj; that means I don't know; I haven't any means of telling. I was not here when they came, and you were not here, so you can't deny what I say. I simply say ' % a Rood many hundred vicars" and let it go at that. Whether they have been here a good many thousand years or not, I don't know; but this much I want you to agree with Me on: that the great body of these trees is south and east of us. which would indicate to the geographksJ bot - anist that they came in from that direction. They did not come in from northern Iowa, up by Sioux City; they did not come from the Kocky Mountains, because these oaks are not found there. The white oaks and red oaks did not come from the Kocky Mountains. The great body of these trees lies to the southeast of us. and they came from that direction — from that great body of timl&gt;er. So, then, our timber trees may be said to have simply extended themselves up into Nebraska, so that if you should go up a certain stream until you come to the further - most tree, you could say that that kind of tree has "extended itself" that far up the stream. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">Sl'ICKAl' ill' NATURAL IwliKSTS IN NKIIKASKA. 41 Nebraska is peculiarly situated. Over iu the western part of lie state we have had auother inclusion of trees. Nebraska us received most of her trees from the eastern forest region, »ut we have also received some trees from the west. The Huf - alo Berry is not commonly called a tree, vet it is often big nough to Iw a real tree. It is clearly a western tree; it is not u eastern tree at all. It has come down from the edge of the nountains, across the plains, until it has come almost to the lissouri river, and I think very likely it will be found to have ctually reached the river in the northern part of the state. I The Western Maple, or Mountain Maple, which is so abundant 1 through the Rocky Mountain region, has come into Nebraska il v a very few miles. At the northwest corner of the si tis maple has come in a little, theii down between the North latte river and the Lodgepole, where there is a great exteu - on of mountain-like hills — foot hills — there also the Mountain aple has come in. This is simply an eastern extension of a estern tree. Then in northwestern Nebraska there is a very irrow-leaved cotton wood; the leaf is as narrow as a common illow leaf, and perhaps five or six inches long. It is utterly alike our ordinary cottonwood in appearance. This tree en- T8 into a little part of the northwestern county of the state; ■rhaps fifteen or twenty miles.* But as you go out of the ate westward you find it very abundant in the Rocky Moun - lins. There is also another cottonwood that is not known or [anted in this part of the country, known as Kydbergs Cotton - ood. This is a new thing which has been found iu some of u- canyons in the extreme western {&gt;ortion of the state, and is undoubtedly come down from the west. I have yet to mention the two most important western ti The "I'onderosa pine" comes in at the northwest corner of the state and follows the bluffs of the Niobrara river to within about thirty or forty miles of the Missouri river. It does not grow nearer than that now, though I have no doubt what •I have since learned that it occurs also in the mountains of Scott's Bluff county. </seg>

Of ciinrw it is a valuable tree and j&gt;eople have been using it. and today you find it witliiu one or two counties onlv from tin' mouth of the Xiobrara river in the northern part of the state. Then on the IMatte river, the North Platte has this pine following down probably fifty or sixty miles; the Lodgepole river has it following down thirty or forty mile*. These pines formerly extended down a considerable distance east of North Platte along the Platte river. We find them seal teied over the sand hill region also, so that this pine probably once extended about half way across the state. If you draw a diagonal line from the northeast corner of the state to the southwest corner, you will just about have the eastern boundary of tlie "l'onderosa pine." The other important western tree is the Bockj Mountain lied Cedar, which is frequently confused witli our common red cedar. The common red cedar has com - from -the east but the western red cedar has come down from the mountains, and they have mingled with one another about the middle of the state. I think I have the statement fairly before you now. that a few of our trees have come down from the mountains; that the bulk of our trees (that we have not planted ourselvesi have come up from the Missouri forests. This brings up this ques tion: If the forest trees that are native to the state have come from the east, and from the west, and so have come to occupy such areas as they do naturally in the state, are these trees MM •{treading? Is this process now going on? Are the western trees note — indeiMiident of 'man's active agency — still slowlv moving themselves eastward? Are the eastern trees — the oaks, elms, ashes, and so on — slowly extending themselves up across the state, or is this something that has beta completed and is not going on now? Is it that the forests were once much more extensive, and that they are now being slowly driven back, so far as nature is concerned? I have studied this subject with a good deal of care, and have vacillated somewhat as to what the outcome would be, but two years ago I made a very careful </seg>

Here there are points tliat are fully "&gt;&lt;MM&gt; feet above tide water, and which the people locally sj*&gt;ak of as mountains; so that while our geographic* do not say so. we have actual mountains in Nebraska which are worthy of the name. There are summits there which arc actually higher than the highest points of the Allegheny mountains in Pennsylvania. We speak of the Alle* ghteaieu as mountains, yet even Tine Ridge, where the railway tunnel runs through it. is higher than the highest point of the Allegheny mountains in the state of Pennsylvania. (Mi that high land stretching itself eastward south of die North i'latte river two years ago I studied the question as to whether i pines were coating east or retreating; whether the forests are dying and disappearing, or whether they are slowly working their way eastward into the state. I had the good fortune to have with me a young man who was very critical, yet he agreed, before we came away, that there was no (piestiou that the forests were creeping eastward. The pine forest area of that region is taking possession of more land, instead of retreating. The trees are extending the forest area, instead of surrendering the forest area. We found that the nearer you are to the Wyom - ing line the greater the number of old. big pine trees; and ai go away from the Wyoming line, there are fewer old trees, and a great many young trees; not undersized or stunted trees, but simply i/oiiHi/ trees. And there are no signs, either, where JKHUMJ trees are. that there ever were other trees around them. When a pine tree falls to the groand it always leaves signs of the fallen trunk, but there were no signs whatever to indicate that older trees had been there, and disappeared. We found a great many places where there were pine trees old enough to be bearing (ones, and here there would be ;i little colony of young pines within a reasonable distance of the mother In fact, we satisfied ourselves that so far as the pine was cerned in that part of the state, it was pushing itself east* Understand that I make no account in this discussion of what </seg>
            <seg id="p045">44 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OCIETY. man may do to stop this. Suppose that man goes iu there and keeps cutting away the trees; he might stop their eastward -:ress, but that does not affect the fact that the climatic con - ditions and the conditions of the tree itself are such that nature is pushing it eastward. She may push up against some man's pasture fence and there fail, but nature is nevertheless doing her share to push the forest eastward. So much for that. We are probably more interested in the eastern portion of the state. Some ten or twelve years ago after I had been in the state a few years traveling about it, the question came to me over and over again as to whether our trees are not extending themselves up the valleys. Go up the valley of the Blue; as you pass up until you finally come to the last of the trees, it is always this way: the trees, when you com* to the last of them, constitute a little narrow belt of timber and they are always young trees. I find this practically so in every place. There are a few exceptions, but in so many cases as you go farther along in these little branching belts of timber you find that the trees are young trees; there are n.o old trees Reverse the process. Start at the very further end of the dis tribution of timber; start with these young trees; and as you follow down, you find larger, taller, older trees. After I ha( seen this a great many times in many different places, I could not avoid the conclusion that these were young trees, and were recent trees. I once had a conversation on this subject with an eminent authority on the forest trees of this country. Whei I stated my conclusions to him he seemed astonished and som»' what disgusted, and finally laughed at me and said that he didn't think there was anything in it. His theory was tha these younger trees at the upper end of any stretch of timbe land were simply sprouts from older trees which the people had cut out, or which had been burned out. I had not been over the state then as much as I have now, but I believed then as I believe now, that he was wrong. Since then for ten years or more I have been watching this thing with a good deal o care and it seems to me that I now have facts enough, or gen </seg>
            <seg id="p046">45 eral observations enough, so that I ran come before you with a tentative conclusion which I want you to discuss with a good deal of freedom. My tentative conclusion is this: That in the eastern part of the state where man has not aggressively stopped the distribution, nor aggressively aided the distribution — where man has simply been standing with his hands in his pockets, seeing fair play between the trees and nature — the trees are creeping up the hillsides from the narrow belts of timber at the bottom near the streams, and that the trees are extending up the streams further than they originally extended. In going from Weeping Water towards Lincoln on the Mis souri Pacific railroad, I botanized at two or three points a num - ber of years ago, and as I passed to the extreme western limit of the oak trees and found nothing but little oak trees, 1 could not come to any other conclusion than that these hillsides had become covered with oak trees within a comparatively short period of years, and that the oaks — and other trees, too — ai - day actually spreading up these hillsides and up the bottoms of the valleys. Then, as you pass up from the little* town of Val - paraiso westward along the Union Pacific, you have the same thing: the larger trees are at Valparaiso, and as you go towards David City the trees become fewer and smaller and younger, until you pass by the last of the yonng trees. I might go on with this citation indefinitely, but I want sim ply to put the case before you and ask you to take the matter under advisement, so that we may arrive at some conclusion. I would like, then, to ask those who are here in the audience, who have been looking critically at these matters, and who can look back over a period long enough, to give me their help in this matter. Let us not, because we should like to have it so, testify this way or that way; let us not testify that the trees are of course spreading, simply because we should like to s&gt; so. I ask each one of you to think of particular places where trees are growing now, where, within your memory, there were no trees, and where man has not gone in and planted the i but, as I said has simply seen fair play and thus allowed the </seg>

The question is this. and it is one of a great deal of importance to us: "Are we in a region where the natural conditions are such that the forests are still doing what they had to do to give us any forests at all. or have we, in the cycle of changes which take place on this world, come to the time when the conditions that gave us the forests have changed and now the forests are retreating?" That is the problem upon which I want your testimony. In my rather informal talk 1 have left out much that might have been said because I wanted to save fiftiH&gt;n minutes of my time for a ge« - eral discussion. I will ask Mr. Rarnnrd, tirst, to tell us a few things, and I hope the rest of you will follow. DI8CUS8IOK. Mr. Basnabd: I have lived on the place where I now li\ (near Table Rock, in Tawnee county! twenty-nine years. In draw or hollow within half a mile of where I live, twentv-nin years ago there was a buffalo wallow in which there was fn foiling, and it was just a nice place to go swimming. I remei her one fall in particular I used to go over there almost evei day or every Bight. I had nothing else to do. The gnuahoppe had taken the crops, so we had nothing to do but go fishing am swimming. A short time ago Dr. Be— cy asked me about th matter, and since then I have been thinking about this plac At the time I speak of there wasn't a thing there but hig ■tough- graaa — as high as a horse's back. There wasn't a tn or shrub there, and the tire ran over it every year. After a whi the land was broken up and the people farmed up as (lose . hie to this chain of buffalo wallows; the tire was kept on and by and by the willows crept in 'here, and a little later tl box elders. Since the Doctor spoke to me about this subje a week or so ago, I took the time to take a ramble over this pa ticnlar piece of ground, and I found to my astonishment th; those trees had crept up that "draw" more than two miles.

The walnut and hickory ir small, and the oaks arc small, because they haven't been there so foilg. I also call to mind another instance. A gentleman and his wife came out here from Springfield. .Mass., for his health. He brought along the ideas of the Massachusetts people, and thought he must have some tame grass. So he plowed up a lit - tle neck of land close to the stream and sowed it to grass. Well, in the course of a few years his gna went the way of all the tame grass at that time. The overflow killed out the grass and left a sediment in which there came up elm seedlings, and I have shipped car loads of elm trees three and four inches in diameter out of that patch — shipped them to Denver for shade trees. And there were a great many elm trees there too large for our u ro. The other day I spoke to a neighbor on this subject and said. "How about this thing?" He stopped and thought a minute and then said: "Why. right down there we used to get the only hay we had in this country. In that field where there art- now trees thirty and forty feet high and twelve inches in diameter, red and white elm. right in those places we used to go swimming and fishing; used to catch bull-heads and sun fish in those holes." There is nothing now to indicate that there ever was a buffalo wallow there, and the trees have grown out from the stream as Ear as the farm lands would let them, until they have filled very lit t It- nook and corner. And out in these little branches niles away from any large hackberry timber, we find little hack - beirjr trees. They didn't come down stream, but. as Dr. B* says, they went up stream. Mu. Wfutkouh: I have observed to a certain extent the exten - sion of natural timber, though my observation has been mainly on land that had been broken up and the fire shut out. and the timber coming in on those places. In 1836, when I took np my claim where I now live (near Arlington, in Washington county), we crossed a small stream nt a |»oint a little above where the wagon road now crosses it, and I am satisfied now that at that </seg>

Doctor, I recalled that old saying that "Ancient philosophy sat in closets and argned how thing! ought to be; modern philosophy went out into the world to see how things were.'' It seems to me you have been at work on th.it line; visiting various portions of the state to see what was going on. I Hiink I have had some conversation or correspondence with you — perhaps both — as to whether our timber is increasing or decreasing. Take this county i Nemaha in 18i"&gt; there was quite a good desil of timber spread along th river bottom and up the larger streams, but not much up th smaller streams. That older timber has all been cut off Ion ago, and yet we have more timber today in Nemaha county, tw to one. than we had when I list came here. I have somewher a small pamphlet, a report made by the Department of Agricu ture at Washington, and it is to the effect that the timber growth is increasing. Not only the cottonwood. but the harder timber; oaks, hickories, walnuts — but more particularly the oaks. We find if the fire is kept off the prairies that these oaks Hhow themselves immediately along the streams and continue to grow further and further up stream. Then, these buffalo wallows that Mr. Barnard speaks of, I remember very distinctly a number of instances of that kind, where the trees have grown up from the lower onto the higher lands, increasing in that way. tk&gt; I rejM'at that there is more timber growing today in Nemaha county — timber of spontaneous growth — than we had originally. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">49 This proves to my mind that the timber growth of the state of Nebraska is increasing. |5ut there comes in a very stubborn thought in connection with t. I think I have propounded the question to you before, and on"t think you gave me an answer that was satisfactory to irself or to me. Whence come all those trees invading our te from the southeast, coming over from Missouri? How do y get across the river, or why this spontaneous growth?

Whence comes I think in one talk with you I fell back upon the old orig - 1 idea of the creation. When we tirst came here we dug wells this open prairie forty, rifty, sixty or a hundred feet deep; t soil was thrown up beside the well and lay there a year or » without any signs of vitality or growth, but after a while re would spring up a new growth; an entirely new sort of 88 or weed. Whence come they? ]&gt;ut in regard to the question which you have presented this evening, I have no doubt at all about the increase of our timber. Certain varieties of trees are found more abundantly in this extreme southeastern portion of the state, but these are creeping up these draws and streams towards the west. About those coming in from the mountain region, I have had no experience. but I have talked with you about it. and heard the experience of others who have been in the same tield to learn what was going on there, and I haven't any doubt in my mind but that after a while, generations hence, this will be the great timber region of the country.

The following account of the Peach-tree Borer is quoted in full from Circular No. 17, 2d series. Division of Entomology, I. S. Department of Agriculture. It was prepared by Mr. ('. L.

"The brownish, gummy exudations, more or less soiled with earth and larval excrement, about the bases of peach trees, and also, to a less extent, of the cherry and plum, are familiar to all growers of these fruits. These exudations indicate the pres - ence of the peach-tree borer, which undergoes its development just within the bark, mining between the bark and the sapwood, often completely girdling and causing the death of trees, and always greatly injuring and weakening them. The parent of this larva is not often seen. It is a very slender, dark-blue moth, </seg>

The marking of the wasp is especially noticeable in the case of the male insect, the wings of which are transparent, bordered with steel blue, which is the general eok) of the bodj in both sixes. The fore-wings of the female are blue and clothed with scales, while tlie hind wings are trans parent, rambling those of the male. The middle of the abd« E&lt;ii of the female is marked by a broad orange band. The male ;pands about one inch and the female an inch and a half or ore. OUIC1N AM) DISTRIBUTION. "This insect is a native American species, and was described i.v Thomas Say. of Philadelphia, earlj in the present century, ts food plant prior to the introduction of the peach bj Euro wans was undoubtedly some of the wild plums, and the fact that this country is its native home easily explains its presen wide distribution. It occurs practically wherever the peach i grown throughout the Tinted States, our records covering th country from Maine southward to the Gulf and westward to th Pacific sIojm'. Naturally, its presence is most noticeable in th districts where peach growing is a prominent industry, notahl. in Maryland and Delaware and from Michigan southwan throughout the upper valley of the Mississippi and its tribu - taries. NATURAL HISTORY AND HABITS. 'There is but one generation of larva' annually. The moths appear as early as May in the latitude of Washington, 1). ('. and southward, over what approximates the lower austra region. In the upper austral region, roughly comprising the states above the cotton belt and below the northern tier, the moths do not appear until after the middle of June. In the transition region, which comprises the northern tier of states together with most of New York and New England, the moth apjM'ar chiefly in July and later, emerging, however, as early a June, and. belated individuals as late as October. June and July </seg>
            <seg id="p066">1" THE STONE Fill" ITS. 65 an- therefore the worst months for the moths orer the principal pe*ch districts. "The egg is deposited on the hark, usually at or near the sur face of the grand, although rarely it may he placed well up on the trunk or in the CNtehai of the larger branches. The egg is very minute, ami irregularly ornamented with hexagonal sculpturing. The JOUg larva on hatching is very active, and immediately burrows into the bark, usually entering at cracks. Having worked its way to the sapwood, usually near or below the surface of the ground, it feeds steadily through the balance of the summer and well into the fall, constantly enlarging its excavation, and causing the exudation of the gum, intermixed with excrement and fragments of bark, which is so characteris tic of its presence. It remains dormant in the larval state during winter and resumes feeding again the following spring, reaching full growth in the central districts by the middle of June. It transforms to chrysalis within an elongate, cocoon like cell con - structed of its own frass and particles of bark attached with gum and threads of silk. The moths emerge very shortly after the chrysalis state is assumed, usually only a few days inter - vening. The males appear a few days earlier than the females. ''The full-grown larva attains a length of about an inch, is rather robust, of a yellowish white color, with head and first segment brown. PREVENTIVES AND REMEDIES. "There are two principal methods of preventing injury by this insect, viz.: (1) means, mechanical and other, designed either to keep the female moth from depositing her eggs on the trees or at least to prevent the young hurra from effecting an entrance into the bark; and (2) applications to the trunk, which will poison the larvae in eating in from the outside. All of these preventive measures must be attended to before the emergence of the parent insect, which will vary as indicated in the different latitudes. "There is no better mechanical protection than the one rec- 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p067">66 «;»■« NKKKASKA STATK HOKTIfCl.TIRAL SOCIETY oniinenried by Harris in 182f&gt;, which consists in removing a little of the earth from about the base of the tree and s,urroundinu the trunk with a strip of sheathing paj&gt;er eight or nine inches wide, and extending two inches below the soil, secured with strings above, and by replacing the soil about the trunk below. The wrappings may be removed in winter and renewed in June. A more durable sheathing for the trunk, described b.v Dr. Lint - ner, is one of fine wire netting. Cylinders of this wire 115 inches long can be secured, it is. stated, for about |12 per hundred. Rye or other straw may be bound about the trunks of the tives or any similar material may be used as a means of mechanical protection. An old remedy consists of mounding up earth a foot or so about the trunks with the same object in view. In late years very good success has been had by coating the trunks with a heavy whitewash, which may be made more tough and per sistent by the addition of a little glue or soft soap. All of these applications should extend from a few inches below the surface of the ground upward to a height of one foot to eighteen inches. In case of the lime coatings the applications may extend up to the lower branches. A protective measure, which has very re cently been tried successfully in New Jersey (Smith), is the use of insect lime, either in domestic manufacture or foreign brand, applying it in a coating about three-sixteenths of an inch thick to the trunks of the trees from the- ground to the branches, firs! preferably scraping off the loose bark. "Somewhat allied to mechanical protections are appHcatieaa to the trunk which are obnoxious to the moths and which may prevent them from ovipositing. Carbolic acid washes are per haps the best for this purjMtse, and various formulas have beea given. Dr. Lintner quotes Mr. IJateman, of Painesville, Ohio, as having had good success with the following wash: "(ne pint of crude carbolic acid or one-half pint of refined rfcid, combined with a gallon of good soft soap, and the whole diluted with the addition of eight gallons of soft water. The wash is applied thoroughly with a brush, care being taken tn wet all the crevices. « </seg>
            <seg id="p068">67 INSECT KNEMIKS OP THE STONE FKt'ITS, "The following similar WMh is recommended by Mr. J. H Hale, the well-known peach grower of Connecticut : "Two quarts of strong ««ift soap and half a pint of crude car - bolic acid, with two ounces of Paris green, are thoroughly in - corporated in a bucketful of water and enough lime and « lav added to make a thin paste. "The application of jniisons to the trunk is a more recent practice, and seems to have been tirst recommended by Mr. \V. H. Ashmead in 1888, in the suggestion of a strong soap wash. combined' with l'aris green or London purple; a preferable wash, and one now usually recommended, is an admixtui an arsenical with the lime coating referred to above, using two or three ounces of jM&gt;ison with every pailful of the whitewash. The advantage of the poison is that it effects the destruction of any larva* which may succeed in j&gt;enetrating the lime. The application recommended by Mr. Hale is allied to the last. The l.cst of the foregoing preventives are the mechanical protections and the lime arsenical washes. The carbolic acid wash can not Ik* so thoroughly relied upon. ''The measures given above are protective, and do not apply to the larva' already in the tree*. Protected as these larva' are by the covering bark and exudations of gum, they are out of rear* of poisons, and there is nothing to do but to cut them out with a knife. They may be easily found and. with a little removed without injuring the tree. The adoption thereafter of one or the other of the means already described should prevent the trees from again becoming infested, but should this in any case occur, the knife should be pj-omptly used." THE PEACH TWIG BORER. {Anaraia VmruMUi Zell.) One of the most important pesek-tMC enemies is the little moth known by the above name. It was introduced from EiirojKi in early days and has been quite widely distributed throughout </seg>
            <seg id="p069">68 the United States and Canada so that at present it is to be found wherever the peach is grown to any great extent. Until a comparatively recent date this insect and the Strawberry Crown borer or miner have been confounded by entomologists. In L8M, however, Mr. C. I&gt;. Marlatt of the D.

In this paper the writer sets forth the life-history of the insect as made out by the studies referred to above. The present brief review will be based almost entirely on Marlatfs account of the insect; — in fact the illustrations and quotations will be from him (See Hull. No. 1(1, n. ser., I'. S. Dept.

These eggs soon hatch and the little </seg>

In spring when the new growth starts these hibernated larvae leave their winter quarters and enter the twigs where they soon become full-grown — in the meanwhile having, perhaps, killed several terminal twigs by occupying in succession one after the other. These now spin for themselves a very meager cocoon of silk threads either among the wilted leaves, on the trunk, or i on the ground among loose debris, in which the transformation to the chrysalis takes place. This latter lasts but a short time — about seven to ten days — when the mature insect appears and eggs are deposited for another brood. These eggs are laid near the base of leaves. Two or three such broods are reared each year, the last brood is also said to attack the fruit near the stem.

Very prominent among the insect enemies of the stone fruit Until iu tliis country are a number of kinds of boring beetles. These may be separated into three groups, viz.. Hat-head, round - head, and bark-borers. These boring beetles belong to several distinct families and work upon the trees which they attack in different ways. Some of them bore directly into the heart of the larger limbs and the trunk, others work immedrately under the bark upon the sapwood, while still others work iu and destroy the twigs and smaller branches. FLAT HEADED WOOD BORERS. Very prominent among, these wood boring insects of fruit trees arc those known as the flat-headed wood-borers (Bnfiwtiimj.

In the woods and away from cities and towns they are greatly infested by parasites that kill them off, and they are also eagerly sought out and devoured by the different species of woodpeckers that make this sort of work their special business. Much good can also be done at times in the way of capturing and destroying the mature beetles as they are found basking in the bright sun shine upon their favorite trees. TWIG GIRDLER AND TWIG PRUNERS. Not unfrequently do we find limbs and small branches of our fruit trees lying upon the ground where they have fallen during ordinary wind storms. An examination shows that they have been cut off by something or other, but just what this some - thing has been is a mystery to most of us. A reference to the accompanying illustrations (Figs. 10 and 11), will at once explain the mystery. Both the "Twig Girdler" and several species of the pruners occur within the state where they cause more or less injury. In the case of the girdler (Fig. 10), it appears that the larva must feed upon dead wood, and that this dead wood must be in a social condition. To this end the female beetle punc- Fi&lt;;.

It is quite a difficult matter to fight these bark borers, and we are obliged to depend mostly on their natural enemies for keeping them in check. Prof. A. S. Packard, in treating of one of these insects, writes (5th Kept. U. 8. Entomological Commis - sion, p. 710) as follows, when speaking of remedies: "This and the other bark-beetles of the pine have —if him insect enemies which wage incessant war upon them. Various species of small beetles i&gt;eitainiug to the families Staphi/liniilir, Hinteriihr, etc., IK always to be met with under the loose worm eaten bark of pines, and M. Perris has ascertained that these insects resort to this situation for the purpose of rearing their young, their larva? being predaceous and subsisting upon the larvae and pupae of the bark beetles." Aside from the good work that is done by the above mentioned friendly Insects in keeping these bark-borers in check, it is a good plan to gather all dead or dying limbs, branches, and even trees that contain these borers and burn them during the winter months. THE NEW YORK WEEVIL. (Icthycerus noveborascensis Forst.) An inBect that frequently ocurs in our orchards, and one that sometimes does considerable injury to different fruit-trees, is what has been called the New York Weevil. This insect, as will be seen by reference to the accompanying figure, is a snout - beetle of large size. It is an early arrival in spring, and fre - quently does much harm by eating the buds and bark of the twigs.

Even housekee]&gt;er who has tried to gSPW a few plants for ornament during the long dreary winter months, is familiar with one or more of these insects from seeing them on her trader charges; while the professional, gardener and horticulturist is too well acquainted with lhe "greenfly" and brown rhrvsan theinum louse of the hot house to need instruction** concerning their injurious nature. Briefly, these plant lice, or "Aphides." as they are quite com nionly called, can l&gt;e characterized as small ■oft-bodied insects which receive their nourishment in the form of juices pumped up by means of a jointed beak which the owner inserts into tin* ten der jKirtions of growing plants. They are provided with six legs, and are winded or not. as happens. When the former, they have two pairs of these members. In their mode of life these lice differ greatly one from another; but rooghly sjieaking, they can be classed as root feeders or M above ground feeders. They may also be separated into gall makei-s and non-gall-niakers. accordingly as each HjM'cies at tacks its host plant. In their modes of reproduction, the majority of the iiieiub is of the family are both oviparous and viviparous, i. c, they nni! - tiply both by means of eggs and by a sort of "budding" pro The groap is further noted as containing members which occur in two or more distinct forms each of which works on different ]H&gt;rtions of the same plant or upon different plants daring dif - ferent seasons of the year. The egg-laying females are also dis - tinct from viviparous females. In fact, taken as a whole, the family Aphidida- is composed of a large number of species that vary greatly among themselves in life-history and fooil-haliits; and it becomes qaite necessary for the horticulturist to acquaint himself with these facts in Order to prescribe remedies for any particular species. </seg>

Since these insects are always more or less protected within their leaf burrows they are rather more difficult to handle than is commonly the case with leaf-feeding species. The arsenical sprays will, however, reach many of the caterpillars and keep them from increasing to any great extent. They are also quite subject to the attacks of hymenopterous parasites.

Much has been written concerning the insect, which was first described in this country by Mr. Walsh. Later, Professor Riley gave a very full account of it along with the admirable figures of the insect and its work (see 4th Mis - souri Report, p. 38), which are copied herewith (Fig. 33.) The following condensed account of the insect, taken chiefly from Riley's report, is copied from Often:" "It affects apple, plum. ♦Transactions of the Iowa State Horticultural 6 p. 109. </seg>

For this purpose it might be well to spray before the trees blossom. Where spraying is generally practiced for the Codling moth and other insect pests this is not at all likely to become troublesome, as the worms will, for the most part, I think, be killed by the later sprayings, and consequently few adults will appear to deposit eggs in summer."

            <seg id="p094">INSKCTT EN EM IES OF THE oTONB FRL ITS. 93 NATURAL HISTORY AND HABITS. The following brief account of the first named of these insects is taken from circular No. 9, second series, of the Entomological Division of the United States Department of Agriculture: "Al - though the females [moths] are wingless, the males are fur - nished with two pairs of rather large, thin wings; the general color is bluish gray, with light and dark markings, as shown at figures 35 and 3&lt;i, n. Oviposition sometimes occurs during mild winters, but as a rule not until March or April. The eggs (Fig. :?4, b) somewhat resemble in miniature those of a hen and an* deposited in irregular masses, usually concealed beneath loose bark and similar objects. They hatch about the time that the apple tree unfolds its leaves in the spring, the date varying with the locality and season, from the middle of April to the latter part of May. The young canker worms eat greedily and grow rapidly, usually attaining to four weeks from the time of then enter the ground to a depth cording to the character of the their full size in from three issuing from the eggs.

REMEDIES. During ordinary years when everything is in a normal condi - tion the natural enemies of these canker-worms keep them in check. These natural enemies are first of all the various kinds of birds that habitually frequent orchards and other places where these insects appear. The chick - adee which is shown in the ac - companying cut (Fig. 17) is one of the most important of these since it remains with us all win ter and spends much of its time in hunting the eggs in early </seg>

Some of the ichneumon flies and tachina flies lay their eggs upon or within the bodies of canker-worms and in that manner assist in keeping down their numbers. Besides these there are also chalcids which lay their eggs within those of the moths and in that manner finding food for their young and destroying the host's eggs. Occasionally these natural enemies fail to do the work and it becomes neces - sary to protect our trees by mechanical or other means. A good spraying with Paris green or London purple (150 gallons of Mater to a pound of the poison) will do the work. The earlier this is done the better, since the quite young caterpillars are more easily poisoned than later when they are larger and older. LEAF-FEEDING CATERPILLARS. (Various kinds.) In addition to the several species of lepidopterous larvse that are treated of at some length in the preceding pages there are a number of others that are always more or less numerous uixm our trees. These, while possibly less injurious than the former, when working together d© a vast amount of injury, floim lilw there will be a dozen or more kinds working at once upon a single tree.

LIFE-HISTORY. The life-history of these beetles, although differing slightly among themselves, may be summed up practically as follows Shortly after pairing, the female beetles creep into the earth especially wherever the soil is rough and loose and more or less covered by vegetation, and after depositing their eggH to the number of forty or fifty, die. These eggs hatch in from thre&lt; to five weeks, and produce grubs that feed upon the roots o Tarious plants and grow slowly for a little upwards of two years, when they change to the pupa stage within cells in tin ground which they construct for themselves. Within thes&lt; cells the beetles remain during the remainder of the summer, fall, and winter into the following spring, when they crawl to the surface and are ready to take active part in the destruction of all kinds of tree foliage and to prepare for the propagation of future generations </seg>

They are t without their natural enemies, both vertebrate and in vert e - iitc and by far the greater majority of them are thus destroyed lieu the time of hatching from the eggs and issuing as bee - •s. A large number of our birds are especially fond of the fat ubs, and can be seen industriously following the plow as it rns them up with the fresh loose soil. All kinds of domestic wls eat them greedily, while hogs industriously search for em by rooting over the ground where they occur in abundance, ice, shrews, moles, ground squirrels, and skunks are also re arkably fond of both the grubs and beetles. (Many of the beetles can be destroyed by jarring the trees evef eets and gathering them as they fall, after which they can drowned in boiling water or thrown into the fire and burnt, her methods can be devised by those who have the in fight, — circumstances, of course, directing these fota.vs ainst the enemy. In some instances the beetles can also be stroyed by spraying the foliage of trees with either London irple or Paris green. t Among their insect enemies the wasp known as Tiphia iniata Say is the greatest. The larva of this black or bluish ack wasp attacks and destroys the grubs, after which it spins pale brown elongate silken cocoon of the kind so frequently ig up when working the ground, and transforms to the pupa ite, and later to the perfect fly.

Pin September, 1899, the Cornell University^Experiment Station ued a bulletin which describes another cherry fruit insect. Flo. ih—Rhagoletu einguiata: a, female fly; 6, face; t, maggot— enlarged. [U. B. Dept Agric. Yearbook for 1807.] This is what has been termed the Cherry Fruit-fly. It has been reported several times in different parts of the eastern and mid- Je states where more or less injury has been caused by its at - acks on cultivated cherries of several varieties. This "fruit-fly"' b especially to be dreaded on account of its manner of attack. i'ruit that has been injured by the plum curculio or little "Turk"' can easily be recognized on account of the peculiar punctures made by the parent insect; "but this new pest gets in its work </seg>
            <seg id="p110">109 INSECT ENEMIES OP THE STONE FRUITS. in such a way that the fruit it infests might easily be classed among the fairest and best on the tree, or in the dish on our breakfast table." CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS PEST The grab of the caresHo is kuown as a short, footless, whitish worn with brownish head. The fruit-fly larva or young maggot, of a yellowish white color; and is described as ha a minute, light-brown, faii-sha{&gt;ed organ projecting from e side of the body near the head. It is described as resembling very closely that of the apple maggot. If the parent insect has been correctly determined from the maggots examined and studied by Professor Slingerland, it is a pretty little fly somewhat smaller than the house-fly, which has the body black and the head and legs yellowish brown. The lateral edges of the thorax are light yellow, and the hind edges of the abdomen whitish. The wings and scutellum are crossed by four blackish bands. TIME AND MODE OF ATTACK. If we are to judge by the European cherry maggot, our insect begins its attacks about the time the cherries are turning red, and it is thought that they mature within two to three weeks. This being true, several broods might be reared during the sum - mer by their beginning with the earlier varieties and continuing to attack successively the later varieties as they ripen through - out the summer and early fall, or but a single generation may be strung out by the irregular appearance of the flies, and a rather slow oviposition. Wild cherries as well as plums may also be attacked by this insect. Professor Slingerland says, "Unfortu - nately this cherry maggot works in a very inconspicuous manner, so that it will be a difficult matter to determine its presence until the mischief is wrought. All of those who suffered from its ravages the past summer did not know of its presence until their attention was called to it by the consumers of the cherries. One grower picked two basketsfull of what seemed to be the </seg>
            <seg id="p111">110 NEBRASKA STATE HORTIOTJLTTXR A Xj SOCIETY* fairest and largest cherries, and took them home for canning. When the housewife came to pit them she was much surprised and disgusted to find that many of them were 'wormy' with these cherry maggots. * * * If the cherries are allowed to remai on the tree, or are not used within a few days after picking, th work of the maggot will result in a rotting and sinking in o a portion of the fruit. * * When this stage is reached, o often even before the fruit shows signs of rotting, the maggot are usually full-grown and soon crawl out of the fruits. On lover of this luscious fruit reports that when some cherries whir had been left over from a meal the preceding day, were place on the table the next morning for breakfast, it was found tlia several maggots had crawled out during the night. He is n&lt;&gt;\ wondering how many maggot* were unwittingly eaten the dav before!" REMEDIES. Until the entire life-history of this insect shall have been can - fully studied remedial measures can only be guessed at, hence nothing definite will be suggested here. It appears to be a fact that cherries attacked by this insect do not fall to the ground. hence the gathering of windfalls cannot be recommended remedy. Arsenical sprays and kerosene emulsion could not reach the maggots hidden away as they are within the fruit. The only suggestion then to offer would be the destruction of the puparia* within the ground during late summer, fall and early spring This might be accomplished in varions ways. THE CHOKE CHERRY MAGGOT. (Cecidomyia sp.?) Here in Nebraska the choke cherry is sometimes attacked by an insect belonging to the dipterous family (&gt;cidoinyida\ It infests the green fruit and causes it to become more or less de - formed so as to remind one of the "plum pockets" often found on onr wild plums.

In a comparatively short time these maggots become fully matured and leave the fruit, drop to the ground and there hide away where they remain either in the larval form or as pupae till the following spring. Whether or not these insects will ever attack our cultivated cherries I cannot say. THE PL1M (TUrUUO. (Conotrachelus nenuphar Herbst.) One of the most important, if not the most important, insect enemies of our stone fruits is the "Little Turk" or Plum Curculio. It was recorded as a pest at least as early as 1740, and without doubt is \ a native of America, where it has x«»^ «"^^^^ lived upon our wild fruits from a 7^ .^fc. very remote period.

The furnishing of regular places for breeding each suc - cessive year has made it possible to more than hold its own. In writing about the food plants of this insect in 1888 Pro - fessor C. V. Riley and L. &lt;). Howard have used the following language:* ■ ''The Plum Cureulio has brought about an almost entire aban - donment of plum culture in many sections of the country within the last twenty years; but it is by no means confined to this fruit. It breeds in great numbers in cherries, peaches, apricots, necta - rines, and other stone fruits, including the persimmon, and •Report of the United States Department of Agriculture for 1888, p. 59. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">112 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. also infests many varieties of apples, crabs, and haws. It prefers, however, smooth-skinned fruits. It is also a common inhabitant of the fungus growth of plum and cherry known as "Black Knot," from which it was first reared by Peck in 181 s." HABITS AND NATURAL HISTORY. The egg of this insect is of a pearl-white color, and large enough to be seen with the unaided eye. It is laid in the green fruit soon after the latter has formed; and as many as fifty to a hundred may be deposited by a single female insect. About fifteen minutes are required for the deposition of a single egg. The process is described as follows by Professor Riley: "Having taken a strong hold on the fruit the female makes a minute cut with the jaws, which are at the end of her snout, just through the skin of the fruit, and then runs the snout under the skin to the depth of one-sixteenth of an inch, and moves it back and forth until the cavity is large enough to receive the egg it is to retain. She next changes her position, and drops an egg into the mouth of the cut; then, veering round again, she pushes it by means of her snout to the end of the passage, and afterwards cuts the crescent in front of the hole so as to undermine the egg and leave it in a sort of flap; her object apparently being to deaden this flap so as to prevent the growing fruit from crushing the egg, though Dr. Hull informs me that he has repeatedly re - moved the insect as soon as the egg was deposited and before the flap was made, and the egg hatched and the young penetrated the fruit in every instance." The eggs hatch in from three to five or more days, and as many as one to a dozen or even more may be deposited in a single plum. Perhaps these are the products of several different females. The larva or grub is wkite and footless and furnished with a brownish horny head. It works its way at once to the pit or stone of the fruit around which it feeds until matured. The length of time required by the larva in attaining- its growth varies from three to five weeks, when it is about 10 millimeters in length, rather stout, and of a glistening white color. Plums, </seg>
            <seg id="p114">113 INSECT ENEMIES OF THE STONE FRUITS. apricots and peaches that contain these grubs generally fall to the ground prematurely. Cherries, however, remain on the trees, as a rule. Only a single larva is found in each cherry, but sev - eral occasionally occur in the larger fruits. After maturing these larvae leave the fruit and enter the ground where they pupate and later change to the beetles. This change takes place during late summer and fall. The beetles, hibernating under various kinds of rubbish and in the ground, issue forth in early spring in time to attack the buds and blossoms on which they feed quite freely. They also feed upon the green fruit and also even upon. the leaves. NATURAL ENEMIES. This insect has many natural enemies that aid in keeping it within bounds. Birds and poultry feed readily on the beetles, he latter quite effectually destroying most of the insects that ssue in localities accessible to them. Some of the grubs are also destroyed by several predaceous insects, while many others all prey to certain parasitic species that seem to live on them exclusively. REMEDIES. The insects can be captured and destroyed in several ways. They can be jarred from the trees and caught on sheets and after - wards destroyed. They can also be trapped by placing chips and other things on the ground in early spring for the beetles to creep under and afterward turned over and the hiding insects destroyed. A spray of London purple and water at the rate of one pound of the poison to 100 gallons of water will kill the insects and not greatly injure the foliage of the plum and cherry. The foliage of the peach will not stand so strong a mixture, and one that is much weaker will not kill the curculio. THE PLUM GOUGER. (Coccotorus prunicida Walsh.) Another very important insect to plum growers, at least in this 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p115">114 114 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. western country, is that known by the above name. It i« about the same size as the curculio, and like that insect also works in the fruit which it destroys. Instead of working in the pulp abour the pit or stone as does that of the Curmlio the grub of this sec - ond species at once enters the pit and feeds upon its contents. Some years ago I watched the female Plum Gouger depositing her eggs tind described the operation as follows: "The modus Fio. 70.— Plum Gontrer. [Insect Life.] FKi. 71. — Sand-cherry Gouger [Insect Life. operandi is very simple, and requires but a minute and a half or two minutes for the performance of the entire operation. She first spreads out to their fullest extent all of her legs, braces them, and then draws her beak or rostrum to as nearly a perpen - dicular position as possible, then by gnawing and with a twisting motion soon works her snout into the young fruit until it is buried a trifle above the bases of the antennae, the latter being held close against and directed upward along the rostrum upon the head while the hole is being made. She now draws out her beak and deliberately turns about, and after a few preliminary thrusts of the ovipositor inserts the latter into the hole just made with the beak and deposits a single egg that is of the same diameter as the puncture. The egg is of a dirty whitish, some - what transparent color, and is plainly visible with an ordinary </seg>
            <seg id="p116">115 INSECT ENEMIES OF THE STONE FRDITS. pocket lens, being uncovered and nearly flush with the surface. It soon becomes covered by the healing of the injured fruit. This ciirculionid does not make tlie semicircular lunate gash that is so characteristic of the 'little Turk.' It deposits a single egg in each plum attacked. Hut some plums examined were found to contain several eggs, several weevils having no doubt used the same plum for oviposition. When the egg has hatched and the young grub commences to bore into the fruit, a transparent, gummy substance oozes from the puncture. Fruit containing the grubs of this weevil does not necessarily fall prematurely, nor does it appear to be greatly injured for use. The mature insects from the new brood begin emerging by the time fruit commences ripening, and from that time on to late in the fall. They winter in the ground and in various sheltered local about plum patches. In spring they appear with the first buds and blossoms, and can be jarred from the trees like their ally, the 'little Turk." They cling more tightly, however, than that insect does, and a much severer jarring is required to dislodge them. Their puncturing, while not so marked as that of the other insect, begins just a very little earlier and continues per - haps somewhat later in summer REMEDIES. Of course all fallen fruit containing larva- of this, as well aa of the other insect, should be destroyed. Feeding it to the hogs will serve two purposes. The arsenical sprays will have some beneficial effect, while all additional ways of destroying the in - sect will be of value. THE SAND-CHERRY GOUGER. A second species of the genus &lt; o.cotorus occurs here in braska and is known as the Sand cherry Couger because of its attacking that fruit. In general appearance this and the Plum (CtoeotorM tcwUUmri* Lee.) </seg>
            <seg id="p117">116 Gouger are very similar, only the latter is somewhat the larger. The two insects have similar habits so far as their mode of at - tack is concerned. Should this insect ever discover the relationship of our culti - vated cherries to that of its natural food-plant, and thereby change its food habits so as to include the tree cherries, the result would certainly prove very disastrous. The Sand-cherry Gouger is illustrated herewith (see Fig. 71)- WHY SHOULD WE PLANT TREES. BY DR. CHARLES E. BESSEY. I have impressed on me more and more, every time I move out into the state, some things. I came late into the state. Here are veterans who have been here fighting the same fight for years. I think that the army of those who are fighting the fight of the planting of trees should be constantly recruited. This is not a war with a time limit at all, and it will not do for us to say that Gov. Furnas, J. Sterling Morton, and a number of other hon - orable names, many of whom have ceased to be with us — it is not enough for us to say they have fought a good fight ; we have millions of trees planted in this state, but we must continue this work; we must keep the recruiting office open constantly. One thing in which I rejoice is the fact that this horticultural soci - ety has been a sort of recruiting office for the enlistment of those who wish to fight the fight in favor of planting tree*; covering this state with forest. I was born in a state every acre of which, except the swamp land, was covered with forest. And what did we do? We cut down that great forest. We laugh at the people in the fable who killed the goose that laid the golden egg, and say "What silly fools they were"; and yet we in Ohio cut ruthlessly away that great forest, just as so many people are killing ruthlessly the birds which we heard about a few moments ago. I am glad to </seg>
            <seg id="p118">117 WHY SHOULD WE PLANT TREES. say that I never cut many trees. I wasn't big enough or strong enough to be of much use in the timber, so I haven't many trees to blame myself for cutting. But they were cut; so that Ohio is now almost a prairie state. We think of what hard work it waa to make Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and the states to the eastward, what they now are — great stretches of open country. We think of the people who gave their lives in this fight against the tree, and then when our predecessors came out here to the plains where they "did not have to take those miserable trees out of the way" we learned a lesson. We have learned that where trees are not, trees must be put.' I have come to the conclusion that it will probably take just as much hard work to make a plains state a good state in which men should spend their lives. It was killing work to cut the great trees and get rid of them; and it is going to take as much work to put Nebraska, to put Kansas, to put Iowa and the Dakotas into the condition in which tlmse states should be for our homes, as if we had to do the other thing — tut the trees away. We have to preach the crusade of the tilling up of this state with trees, and to do that we must plant trees, and plant trees, and plant trees. One of the prettiest sights I have seen in many years was what I noticed last evening in driving part way over from Brock to Johnson, the remainder of the way this morning, stopping over night at Mr. Aldrich's place. As I came to the tops of these swells I looked off over the hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of trees that have already been planted. But this ia not enough. Of course, many of these were already here, and many more have been planted; but this is not enough; as yon go a little distance west you will find the trees fewer and fewer until finally you will come to where trees are a rarity. Two years ago I took a run up into the extreme western part of the state, and after several days in that exceedingly treeless coun - try, I came down the Union Pacific. And the feeling that came to me as we came to larger and larger trees waa the same aa expressed by our returning soldier boys: "Getting back once more into God's country." </seg>

I saw a few fence posts here am there, where wire's had been strung for fences; the wires ha disappeared, and I actually saw lots and lots of grasshoppei gathered on the shady side of those fence posts to get shadi Just imagine what human beings would feel in a land whei the grassliopjK'is hunt for shade like that. One reason wh this portion of Nebraska is so much better than that up thei is that we have more shade; but we have not enough of i Some years ago I had the pleasure of traveling through portioi of rural England, and the abundance of their shade tr&lt; ■ very striking to one from the plains here. The English farnn redeems every acre of ground, and instead of having his tret massed all in one place, these grateful shade trees are K&amp;ttere all over. Of course they are left where they would do no pa ticular harm to the crops. Especially do we need shade in a land where the sun i - bright and constant as it is here. We college men notice some of these things more than others because we are obliged to. My attention was (ailed a few years ago to the fact that we have so much more sunshine than thev have even in our own countrv </seg>

He had lived with us so long that he was accustomed whenever he wanted a sunbeam to just put his hrlioxtat out of the window and the sun would do the rest. When he got to Cornell he wrote hack after he had been there several months, calling attention to the fact that he was no longer living in a country where he could run to the window and catch a sunbeam when - ever he wanted to. The per cent of sunshine is very, very high in this region, and we must have trees for shade ilet us be very egotistical) for ourselves, and then for our animals. Put it in that way, if you will, but plant for shade. I Second: Plant for Protection. Every little while as you travel er the country you will find that the farm house stands out itself, and the wind can blow from every direction ami I ound the corners of that house. The exception is that the •use is more or less protected ; and finally you come to those aces where the house is thoroughly protected by the shelter - g trees about it. It does not take many trees to deflect the ind. In its sweep, rasping over the surface, it is deflected &gt; fifty or sixty feet, and goes howling over the tree tops with - it touching the house. So let us plant for protection. Third 1 1 should not put it in this order except for a particular mrpose I have this afternoon): Plant for Hruutif. Travel back ith me over that beautiful drive of which I spoke and note iow these trees break up that monotonous (or what would other - ise be nionotonousi skyline. You people have lived here so ong that you have forgotten the fact that the href have added so much to the beauty of this part of the state. It is a beautiful art of the state. I don't say that by way of compliment; I hink we are all agreed on that; and a large part of it is due &gt; the fact that the sky line is constantly broken by these beau ful trees. You don't need to ask the question, "What beauti - ll tree shall I plant?" Almost any tree proj&gt;erlv placed, or roperly massed with others, is beautiful. If I were a word &gt;ainter I would like to paint you some of the picures I have • </seg>

When you plant for beauty, having planted for shade and protection, you can bring in some interesting trees that you could not otherwise use. Out at Mr. Aldrich's beautiful place I stood for five minutes looking at a Gingko tree as tall as this room, while if the protecting trees had not been there it would not live a single winter. And, by the way. if yon do not know the history of this Gingko tree you cannot fail to be thrilled by the fact that in the Gingko you have the remainder of a race that is almost extinct. The Gingkos were abundant once. I don't know how many years ago, all over Nebraska; but now they are all gone except one species that lives in Japan and China. A solitary" species (with some sub-species) stands as a sample of an old fashioned vegetable, all of its relatives hav - ing long since died. You can bring in even such interesting things as that into your grounds if you have made proper pro - tection. ' ~^ """^ Fourth: Plant for Wood. Yes; I do not see why we should not burn wood. I was so delighted last evening when I drove into Mr. Aldrich's yard, and finally went into the house, to find the kitchen stove with wood in it. I was brought up where wood burned in the kitchen stove — and in the other stove, for that matter — but now for years I have been compelled to burn nothing but soft, black, smutty coal. Let us grow trees enough so we will have wood enough to burn in our kitchen stoves if in no other place. We can get along with the hard coal burner very well in the sitting room, but let us grow wood enough so we can have a decent sort of fire in the kitchen. Fifth: Plant to Conserve Moisture. We had a great deal of wild talk a number of years when the rains kept getting more and more and more, simply in the cycle of weather. We thought that by tree planting were increasing the rainfall.

We find that the rain - fall is just about as it was; you cant control that, rainmakers to the contrary notwithstanding. But we can do one thing: We can use more of it, so that when the rain does fall it will not run away. There are very few farms in the state of hraska but have certain places where if a ten, fifteen or twenty acre forest were made, the moisture would be so kept that some distance from there lower down, springs would come out. What is a spring, anyway? A spring is gotten up on exactly the same plan as the old-fashioned leach barrel that our grand - mothers used for making lye; it is nothing more than water com - ing out at one place which went in at another place. We foolish people of Ohio dried up our springs. It took ns a generation to find out why; we wondered why the springs dried up, but what had we been doing? We had been going to the fountain - head of every spring and cutting that away, and then wonder - ing stupidly why the spring stopped. Just as the pefii Ohio destroyed their springs we can make springs if we want to. If you were to go on any of this land where you have upland and lowland, sloping land, ravines, and all that; if were to go in with the divining rod of good, hard common sense and say, "Now here is a place where I could put in a bit of timber that would hold the water, and down below here some place the water will run out as a spring." I have not the slightest doubt but that the time will come when we will plant to save water, not in ponds, but in a better way still; water soaked down into the earth, perhaps in a pond filled up with trees and shrubs, but it will soak down slowly and after a while it will trickle out below in a pure spring. Many of these ravines are unsuitable for cultivation; let us fill them with large trees; plant generously up around the head of every ravine, and we shall have springs. This is a region in which there are springs; do not destroy them. Finally, plant trees. Do not simply plant two or three; plant </seg>

Let us return again to the old period that these veterans inaugurated yean ago when tree planting was the rule for so many people in Nebraska. Let us plant trees. Let us be true to the name we have adopted of "Tree -Planters' State." Plant for shade; plant for protection; plant for beauty; plant for wood, and plant for the conservation of moisture. THE P.EONIA. I have chosen this subject on account of the growing interest in this flower, and because there is little literature or informa - tion on the subject. You look in vain for works describing it. while there are volumes written on the rose and other flowers. Information is needed along this line, for in our western world I believe the pjeonia will forge ahead of the rose. T. &lt;\ Thurlow. the American expert, has written quite a lengthy article for the American Florist, which has been considered as full and com - plete as anything written. He is an old friend of mine, and I am indebted to him for my interest in this flower. .James Kel - way &amp; Son. Langport. Somerset, England, have sent me their splendid Manual, which gives much needed information. THE KOOM IN F.EONIAS. One who closely watches the advance in horticulture is much impressed with the world-wide and growing interest in this flower. Having several times attended the great pa&gt;onia shows of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, where some of the choicest collections of the new world were gathered, and seeing the enraptured and enthusiastic crowds, the interest of the com petitore and their marvelous displays and the additions made year by year. I do not wonder that I became an enthusiast my self, and 1 wish all who read this paper may be. Instead of the two or three kinds of our mothers, I lately had a catalogue from BY C. S. HARRISON, YORK. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">123 THE I'.EONIA. France, with nearly 1,000 varieties, and Mr. ,Welway, in his list, had several hundred not mentioned by the Frenchman. I concluded I would keep up with the procession and stock up. I wrote to the largest dealer in New England, and he had just sold his whole stock to a rich man for his fine grounds at I'eoria. I then wrote to the largest dealer in the west, and he had just sold about all be could spare, to go east, though he generously divided with me. I wrote to several other parties who had advertised them, only to find that they had just sold out. However, I secured about 2,000 in fifty varieties. Mr. Kelway is as noted a wizard in the world of beauty as our own Burhank dr Jackson Hawson. It was his pa-onias that often canied off the prize in Boston. I found his newer sorts were fl'.'dl each, and from that down to ."&gt;&lt;&gt; cents and fl.ltO. Fortunately, a year ago, I had secured about a dozen of his best older kinds. The horticult mists of the old and new world are cautious and level headed men — a little shy of new or untried things, and very conservative. So when there is a simultaneous movement among them, there must be some reason for it. SOME OF THE REASONS. 1. It is one of the easiest flowers to handle. There is strong vitality stored up in the root, so that it bears transportation without trouble. 1'eople often presume too much on thi - bave had them come badly wilted, but there was no trouble in restoring them. 2. It is a plant of such wonderful vigor that on an average it doubles its buds nearly every year. An investment that pays 50 to 100 per cent, is a good one. You think it is awful to pay $L'.."&gt;0 for a single root, and yet if it should double every in ten years you would have l.(HM) plants. ;{.

            <seg id="p125">124 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY the healthiest plant in the world; never troubled by disease, fungus, or insects. 4. They are not injured by cold, or heat, or hail, which pounds other things to ribbons. Sirocco and blizzard are alike to them. Against all dangers which affect other shrubs and plants, they are ironclad. * 5. The}' respond to the highest culture, amply repaying any extra care, and they are as patient as a Rocky Mountain donkey with neglect and poor fare. They will do all they can when choked with weeds and grass and pinched with drouth. Near me, while I write, is a clump in grass and hard ground, which has bloomed twenty years without care. 6. There are vast possibilities of development before them. The numerous families from different parts of the world have been crossed, and the finest of these are being crossed again. Compare the glowing splendor of some of the newer kinds with those we saw in childhood, and you will be conscious that be - fore us is a wide field for expansion. 9. There are not on earth more fragrant or attractive flowers, especially when massed. They rival the rose in elegance and fragrance, and in our own climate they are far more hardy and satisfactory. Once well planted and cared for you can let them remain for years. THE NAME was given from a Greek physician, Paeon, who first used the root for medicine. He was probably a mythical personage, for he dates back to the siege of Troy. We well rememj&gt;er when our mothers sought the roots from their neighbors when we were ill. In mediaeval days, when simple things were so potent and faith was so strong, the paeonia was known as the "gallant herb of the sun," and was taken to prevent the nightmare. Infused in sack and drank before and after the new moon, it was sure to heal weakness in the back. If children were sick, hang a piece of root around the neck. </seg>
            <seg id="p126">125 THE P.EONIA. THE ORIGINAL VARIETIES. The Moutan or tree pteonias are from China and Japan. It is said that in their native country they grow to be ten feet high. They attain a large size in the east. Among the earlier sorts is the Officinalis. This is a native of Switzerland and southern Europe. It was introduced into Eng - land in 1548, and was from thence brought into America in the early days. There are now about ten kinds of this species. The tubers much resemble sweet potatoes. The Tenuifolia is an early single flower, which was introduced from Russia. It has a delicate fern leaf, which, with the deli - cate bloom, makes the plant very attractive. The Edulis is a native of South Siberia, and the root is eaten by the Tartars. That must be a valuable plant, with a potato on one end and a rich flower on the other. Whitman's Paouia is a native of Persia. The Entodi is from the Himalaya region of India. ThtM also a branch of the family growing wild in Oregon and Cali - fornia. Now gather this whole "family together and cross and recross them, and keep on improving and you may imagine the possi - bilities. SOME OF THE NEWER KINI)S. Admiral Detcey has deep rose guard peals with cream center. Ella C. Kchmy, beautiful, soft, lavender flesh color, enclosed in a large guard petal; great solidity of bloom. Portia is a large white flower of extreme beauty. There are ten kinds in this list, and you can have one of each kind for five pounds, or twenty five dollars, our money, with tariff added. At one of the Boston exhibits I noticed the favorites were Baroness Schroder, Francois Ortegal, Festiva, Maxima, Zephy - rus, Miss Brice, Jeanne d'Arc, Lady Bramwell. Most of these I secured. I sent to the largest potakl grower in Illinois for his three - very best, and got 100 La Tulipe. Humeii and Carnea Plena. </seg>

Then you can raise choice things to your heart's content. I n&lt;&gt; that Richardson's Perfection, a grand blush pa-onia, was some - what sunburned, but that was the only one in a large collection. Baroness Schroder is one of the most wonderful white flowers I ever saw. It is a large glebe, and fluffy white, so light, grace - fid and airy, it seemed as though it might float away.

If you are on :\ farm it would be a good idea to enclose seven rods square, about a fourth of an acre, with l'latte cedar*, four feet apart. &lt;ulti - vate well. Put your shrubs and flowers inside, and in the center have your lath screen and very choicest collections. I wish to note the almost iutiuite and matchless shading of these flowers.

I have had something to do with these for twenty years. 1 find they are too delicate to succeed and flower on our wind - swept praries without some protection. Well cared for, they will do well and bloom beautifully. In the more genial climate of the east, which is much like that of England, they bloom in gorgeous splendor, and they are of immense size. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">127 THE P.EONIA. PROPAGATION. Plant a single bud; and if left to itself, it will form a I. stool in a few years. I have rut forty good buds from one clump. 1 have known them planted in grass and starved by large trees, and they would bud every spring, and have no strength to bloom. Last fall I dug up some large stoojs which had not been, able to bloom for years. They had beta so ■tarred and had crowded each other so. that many of the roots* were de - caved. I cut them to a single bud and planted them in rid: with as little root as possible so as to CMBpd them to put out entirely new and vigorous roots. TIME OF PLANTING In our climate September is the best time. Just before the ground froze last fall, I took up some roots 1 had heeled in for spring trade. I found they had new roots six inches long, of course they can be planted in the spring, so can currant cuttings; but the 8,000 of these I planted September 1st, had Hue i before the ground froze. I find it is best to cut back to a single bud for planting. After they have grown a year they are good salable plants. For immediate selling I save out the largest and strongest roots; for customers want size and they will come to flower sooner. But for planting I prefer a small healthy root. The object in cutting so dose is. that often the old root will be decayed, and lacks vigor. By cutting back and using as little of the old as possible you get an entirely new foundation. You will find a great difference in varieties. Some have much stronger roots than others. Some will stand for years and be entirely sound, and others, like pieplant, will show symptoms of old age and need removing. If you cut up fifty different kinds you will find a remarkable root variation, evidently showing the different families from which they were derived. RAISING FKOM USD. Mr. Thurlow says: "Raising pa-onias from seeds is the easiest thing imaginable. Gather the seeds from day to day as fast </seg>
            <seg id="p129">128 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. as they ripen, keep from drying and plant in open ground or, better, in- a frame in the fall ; cover well with evergreen boughs or any coarse material; be sure there are no field mice near the beds, and you will be surprised to see how regular and even they will come up in the spring. Borne keep the seeds in a closed vessel (covered in the ground) over winter and plant in the spring. I can see no difficulty in planting in the fall just before winter sets in. hut care should be taken not to let. the seeds get too dry before planting. The little plants should be set out the following autumn into nicely prepared dry ground and many will flower the third year. The seeds from very choice varieties would likely produce something extra and many new kinds^pf merit will thus be obtained; but where 'every crow considers its own children the whitest' there is danger of being too en - thusiastic over one's own seedlings. Before naming and send - ing them out, better wait and see if they possess decidfnl iu&lt;Tit over oiImts of the same season and color." RAISING FROM ROOTS. When you take up a large bunch to divide, in spite of you, many roots which are brittle will break off. These are generally thrown away. But hold on! Save them, there is life stored there. I have told you the paeonia is very patient. Give it time. In two or three years it will throw out a bud. This is an im - portant item, especially with fine and expensive kinds. The pro - pagator will often throw his roots in a pit, and cover with earth, and leave them to work out their destiny. In this way he will perhaps have a mixed lot. When I get a fine lot I plant and label them, and any extra roots I plant with the rest inside the labels, so there can be no mistake, planting about three inches deep. I have an idea that if a root is right side up, and the top near the surface, neighbor to sun and shower, it will bud sooner than if thrown into a pit. It will not do to plant ja. lot of paeonias on ground you have used before, for the old roots in time will spring up and you will </seg>
            <seg id="p130">129 THE PM0X1A. have a mixture. It is of the highest importance for the propa gator to be absolutely sure of his varieties, and keep honest. Often large bills imported from Home heavy dealers iu Europe have been badly mixed. Then is no excuse for this. A paeonia with a lost label drops down 75 par cent. The new varieties, as I have said before, come very high. I notice that Kehway's new creations in tree pieonias are |5 apiece. We who sell •nt plants, and hear much grumbling at that, little realize how in the great world of horticulture the rarest and best are prized. Five dollars is often readily paid for a flower which will be in bloom only three weeks. I have known fifteen dollars to be paid for a silver pungens, and people think they are cruelly wronged if they have to pay f 1 or $_ for those just as fine in the THE TKEE l'.UO.MA is usually propagated by grafting on the herbaceous pseonia. It takes its own time to develop on a herbaceous root. After four or five years it throws out roots of its own, and then dis - cards the other. It will then multiply by a separate system of roots and heads, which can be parted. In about five yean, if the plant does well, it will stool out, so you can get five to ten from the clump. The better way to propagate by far is to graft them on their own roots. It is a difficult matter to get these, but once secured here is not much trouble. In digging your plants you will find some roots which can be spared. Put scions of the desired kind into these and you will have a plant more in harmony with nature. A tree paeonia on a herbaceous root isn't just the hing. PREPARATION OF THE GROUND either for commercial or flowering purposes: Take land where the soil is deep and rich; plow deep, and sub-soil, and enrich it heavily with hen manure, if you can get it. Trenching three feet deep is a good thing for a permanent bed where you want 9 </seg>

By planting on very rich land, fertilized in this way, I developed splendid blossoms from the first year's planting. Mr. Thurlow, who has taken prize after prize at the Boston flower show, raised about two carloads on two acres, which he sold for f 7,000, and his land does not compare with ours. I find after years of experience that this flower is remarkably well adapted to our soil and climate, from the fact that it grows and blooms in the rainy season and lies dormant in our dry August, and begins to take root again when the dry weather is over. In planting for the nursery put the rows about two feet apart, and eight inches apart in the row. Put them down two or three inches, cover with light earth, and in winter mulch with fine manure. HOW TO GET A START. One wants the best, and yet stands aghast at the cost. Well, then, begin lower down. A nurseryman will often lose his labels, and have a lot mixed. I once secured 800. In them were ten choice varieties. They came quite reasonable. Get such a lot, and plant them in groups. Some will be early and some will be late. In color they will range from purple to snowy white. After blooming a few times, with the help of a cata - logue you may be able to name some of them. But better let them l&gt;e and bloom year after year, and you get acquainted with them. These will do well for lawn effect or cut flowers. Then, after a time, pet one or two of the very choicest, and then a few more, as you are able, and soon you will have a fine collec - tion of the finest flowers that grow — "Flowers for the million and the millionaire" </seg>
            <seg id="p132">CULTIVATION AND COVER CROPS FOR ORCHARDS. 131 AND COVER CROPS FOR ORCHARDS. BY ROLLINS A. EMERSON. Cultivation of orchards has been discussed so many times at the meetings of this society that it would seem needless to speak of it now. Whether or not clean cultivation is practiced by the majority of fruit growers in Nebraska it is certainly recom - mended strongly in the reports of this society. But just as we were coming to believe that the question of the advisability of cultivating orchards was settled for all time it has been opened anew by the effect of the severe weather of last winter (1898-99). Reports from various parts of this state indicate that orchards which were thoroughly cultivated during the summer of 1898 were more severely injured during the following winter than those which were neglected. These reports have come to me mainly from members of this society. I shall, therefore, leave the account of them to those who know the circumstances better than I do. Facts of the same general nature have been observed in neighboring states. At the recent meeting of the Missouri State Horticulture Society many instances of this sort were reported. President Murray, of the society, told of a nursery in northwestern Missouri which had been cultivated carefully through the previous summer and was badly winter-killed, while another which had been neglected came through the winter much better. Professor Craig, of the Iowa Experiment Station, has made a thorough study of winter-killing in Iowa. In the November n umber of the National Xurseryman he sums up the question, in part, as follows: "That the lack of a protecting blanket of snow coupled with unusually low temperatures wai the chief cause of the great loss of nursery stock and orchard trees. That, inasmuch as trees on north slopes suffer more than trees on south aspects and in proportion to the surface protec - tion present, the intensity of frost bore a definite relation to the amount of injury inflicted. That orchard and nursery trees </seg>
            <seg id="p133">132 suffered more on exposed, dry knolls with northern aspects than elsewhere. That the character of winter surface cover, in other words, desirable cover crops, is a question of paramount im - portance in northern Mississippi valley state*." Two theories have been advanced to account for the less severe injury to neglected orchards. One of these assumes that the injury resulted from root-killing, and that the mulch of weeds in neglected orchards protected the roots of the trees. The other asserts that the growth of weeds in neglected or - chards dried out the soil in late summer, thereby checking the growth of wood and ripening it for winter, while cultivation conserved soil moisture so that the trees continued to grow late in fall and entered winter with much immature wood, which was easily killed by freezing. There is probably some founda - tion for both these theories. The latter seems to explain more of the facts observed in this region than the first. Reports from South Dakota and some parts of Iowa, however, indicate that many trees died from root injury. A few apricots on the Uni - versity farm at Lincoln apparently suffered from the same cause. The twigs were in good condition in spring and the trees leaved out almost normally, but the leaves soon withered and did not reappear. In the case of peaches, however, the twigs were evidently winter-killed, while the roots and main branches were apparently little injured. The fact that winter-killing was more pronounced in culti - vated orchards than in non-cultivated ones has led some fruit growers to question the advisability of cultivating orchards at all. But those who have not allowed the misfortunes of one winter to overturn an established practice are convinced that cultivation is still all right. I quote A. J. Masters, of Iowa, who ■ays in the October number of the Western Fruit Grower: "It made me feel rather queer last spring to see how grape - vines in neglected or soddy ground came through the hard win - ter and started off to grow so early and so nicely, while mine, with thorough, clean culture, were so badly injured by the winter. But after cutting back to the ground those that did not </seg>
            <seg id="p134">133 133 CULTIVATION AND COVER CROPS FOR ORCHARDS. put out, and giving them shallow, clean culture all season up to August, I feel rather pleased with the results. I have a splendid new growth and the now dry weather and frosty nights are ripening up the wood in fine shape, while those neg - lected vines I spoke of, with no summer cultivation, look very sick, with the fruit rotting and leaves turning yellow in mid - summer. Some vines are dying outright and the whole general appearance is that of unthriftiness. This is not alone the case with grapes, but with all other small and tree fruits, so I will not give up shallow, clean culture yet for every growing crop in its season." It must not be forgotten that wiuters like the last are not a yearly occurrence, while each new summer emphasizes the importance of saving moisture by cultivation. Notwithstand - ing the fact that some orchards in grass are apparently doing well, I believe that, throughout the greater part of Nebraska, cultivated orchards will make better growth and produce more and better fruit than orchards in sod. It must not be forgotten that, in some cases at least, trees in sod were more severely in - jured by last winter's weather than cultivated trees. At the Missouri meeting, Professor J. C. Whitten reported that at the Experiment Station of that state many fruit trees and orna - mental shrubs grown in grass were injured much more than others of the same varieties which were thoroughly cultivated. The grass seemed to dry out the soil to such an extent that the trees and shrubs became nearly dormant in summer as they would naurally in late fall. Then with warm rains later in autumn, they started growth as though spring had come, some even blossoming. Their wood was too immature to stand the freezes of winter. In view of all this, whjTnot cultivate the orchard during early summer, when trees are making their greatest growth, and then about midsummer sow some crop whk-h by claiming part of the water will ekeek growth, thereby preparing the trees for winter, which will protect the roots during the winter, and which will add humus to the soil when plowed nnder in spring. In short, </seg>
            <seg id="p135">134 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. why not cultivate in the early part of the season and grow a ■r crop in autumn? To briefly summarize, the effects of cover crops in this region are about as follows: They may lessen winter injury by dryin the soil somewhat in autumn, thus allowing the trees to mature and by protecting the roots of trees with a mulch during th winter. They take no moisture from the soil during tin* carl summer, when trees need most water, but rather allow the &lt;&lt;&gt;i servation of moisture by cultivation. They will increase th soil's power of retaining water by the addition of humus whic is formed by their decay, and in the same way will improv the texture of very heavy and sticky soils by making them mat porous and strengthen very light, sandy soils. Last, and per haps less important in this region, they may add plant food t the soil, the latter being true of leguminous crops. It is onl fair to add that some cover crops may exert an unfavorable effect by taking moisture from the soil too late in autumn, after all danger of tree growth is past, leaving the soil so dry that the trees are hurt by winter drying. They may also, if too coarse and heavy, make the soil so light when they are plowed under that it will dry out badly. But these disadvantages may be avoided bj choosing the right sort of cover crops. The Experiment Rtation has begun a test of various plants, to determine their value as cover crops. On the 23d of July there were sown in plats, about twenty feet square, rye, oats, barley, millet, buckwheat, sorghum, corn, rape, field peas, cow - peas, and soy beans. Another plat, on which no crop was sown, was left without cultivation, for comparison with the plats of cover crops. On the 5th of August, duplicate plats were sown. Prom this one season's test of these plants Kam inclined to di - vide cover crops into four classes. To Class I belong plants which make a quick, strong growth and are killed by the first frost, such as buckwheat, sorghum, coin, millet, cowpeas, and soy beans. In ("lass II are included plants which make some what slower growth, and which are killed by freezing weather, such as rape and field peas. In class III I would put plants </seg>

In Class IV belong plants which make a very slow and weak growth in early fall but which live over winter, such as rye. Farther study may how that Classes II and III can be merged into one. Some limits which started growth slowly made more rapid growth when once thoroughly established, overtaking those which tarted much quicker. On the ISth of September the crops anked about as follows; those which had made sufficient growth o cover the entire surface of the ground being ranked first and hose which had made light growth last First: Cowpeas, sorghum, rape. Second: Soy beans, corn, millet. Third: Field peas, buckwheat. Fourth: Barley, oats. Fifth: Rye, no crop. It should be noted that the barley, oats, and rye did not en- rrely prevent the growth of weeds, there being almost as many eeds in these plats as in the plats where no crop was sown. In case of all other crops, no weeds were able to start. To determine which of these crops make the greatest demand on soil moisture, determinations of moisture were made in the plots of the first planting on August 8th, and again on Septem - ber 25th. The moisture in the soil on these two dates, together with the loss of moisture from each plat, are given below: Percent Water Per cent Water Lost of August 8th. Septcmbrr 25th. Water.

            <seg id="p137">136 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. It should be noted that the first planting of barley and oats made much poorer growth than the second planting. If mois - ture determinations had been made in the plats of the second planting, barley and oats would probably have shown a greater percentage of water loss. It is also of interest to note that eowpeas, soy beans, buckwheat, sorghum, corn, and millet were killed by the frosts which occurred from September 24th to 30th, and consequently must have not only stopped loss of water by evaporation through their leaves but also must have acted as a mulch from that time on, checking the evaporation of mois - ture from the soil. Nearly all the plants of rape and field pCM have been killed by freezing weather by the 25th of Novemlx -r. On that date only a comparatively few plants of barley and oats were dead, and rye of course was uninjured. The amount of water which the last-named plants took from the soil after the others had been killed was not determined. The evaporation of water through the leaves of these plants during the months of October and November could not have been as great as dur - ing the preceding two months, but it must have" been consid - erable, nevertheless. In regard to the relative value of the various crops as a pro - tection during winter, little can be said now. At present, Janu - ary 8th, soy beans and cowpeas do not furnish much protection. Soy beanB have lost most of their foliage, only the bare erect stems remaining. Cowpeas still hold their leaves, but the stems stand too erect to furnish much protection to the soil. Buck - wheat plants are but little better. Their leaves are gone and only a few of the stems have fallen over to form a mulch. Rape makes a fair cover. The succulent stems and leaves have with - ered so that the cover they furnish is by no means heavy. The plants, however, are lying flat upon the ground, making a thin mat. The first sowing of rye, barley, and oats is too thin. The first sowing of sorghum is too coarse, the stalks standing erect. This is also true to a less extent of the first sowing of corn and millet. Very good rovers are afforded by field peas and the second sowing of millet, rorn, sorghum, oats, barley, and rye. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">137 ' CULTIVATION AND COVER CROPS FOR ORCHARDS. \ The field peas hold their leaves well, and mat down, making a very thick, even cover. The second sowing of corn and sorghum is also lying flat upon the ground but makes a somewhat thinner cover than field peas. Oats, barley, rye, and millet are begin - ning to mat down somewhat, forming a closer cover than they did some time ago. In cultivated ground, the frost is out of the surface soil, leaving it very muddy. It is interesting to note that in ground free from a crop a blunt stick can be thrust down several in. while under even the poorest covers, such as soy beans, cowpeas, and buckwheat, the ground has thawed less, allowing the stick to be thrust down to a considerably less depth. Under the be«t lovers, such as field peas, millet, rye, sorghum, barley, and oata, the soil is thawed very little, so that the stick can scarcely be thrust into it at all. This would seem to indicate that i crops may be expected to prevent a great deal of the fre&lt; and thawing which the soil undergoes during a period like this, when freezing weather at night is followed by warm weather during the day. Now as to which plant makes best cover crops I am not ready to say. From this one season's experience, however, I am in - clined to favor a crop belonging to Class I. Plants which make a quick growth in early fall may be expected to prevent the growth of weeds which would ripen seeds before winter. Again, plants that are killed by the first frost undoubtedly leave more moisture in the soil for winter than plants that are not killed. A good cover crop should also furnish protection to the soil and the roots of trees during winter. Of the plants belonging to Class I, it will be noted that cowpeas, soy beans, and buckwheat furnish a rather poor winter cover, while corn, sorghnm, and millet make a good cover. It may be that in other seasons the plants included in Class II — field peas and rape — will be killed earlier, so that they would not rob the soil of moisture late in autumn, in which case field peas, which make a very good win - ter cover, might be used in place of the plants belonging to Class I, provided it is desired to grow a leguminous crop to en- </seg>

At present I should not recommend the growth of plants belonging to riass III, — oats, barley, etc., — since their early growth is so slow that weeds gain a foothold and since they continue growth very late in autumn. Moisture taken from the soil after all danger of tree growth is past will prob - ably increase the tendency to winter-kill, at least in the case of some plants. Plants of (lass IV, of which rye is the only one I have had expeiieace with, have the same disadvantages as those of (Mass III. In addition they do not take enough water from the soil to check the growth of trees in autumn and they live through the winter, so that unless they are plowed under early in spring they will make a rapid growth and rob the soil of the moisture necessary to insure a vigorous growth of the - in early summer. At present, then, I should favor millet, -sorghum, or corn as a cover crop, or possibly field peas if it is desired that the cover crop shall enrich the soil as well as fur - nish protection to the tn PLANTS AND SHRUBS SUITABLE FOR THE FARM HOME. BY J. H. HADKIN8ON, OMAHA. The beautifying of our rural homes is not a matter of financia income which every one of the present day stops to think o asking himself or others, "Will it pay?" What an absurd ques tion to ask oneself in this matter. Better ask ourselves if w my enjoyment out of life. If we do, let us go to work an beautify our home surroundings; we will surely get value re ceived from this in pleasure, if not in dollars and cents. I am not writing this for the commercial florist, nor for any other person engaged in these branches of business, but I shall endeavor to encourage the planting of shrubs and plants by our rural population, who I am sure would get enough enjoyment out of it to pay for all the labor and money expended. I shall Tiot endeavor to give a complete list of sliruhs and plants, so do </seg>
            <seg id="p140">139 PLANTS SUITABLE FOR THE FARM HOME. not be disappointed if yon find the list short. It is not a long list of new and rare plants that we need so much as it is to have intelligent and careful attention directed to those that known to succeed in our state. There is no lack of material in our state with which to beautify our homes; what we need most is to get these plants and shrubs together and arrange them in such a manner a"s to produce a pleasing effect. You must not think of planting a snowball — which grows large — in the fore - ground, and a small geranium behind it, hidden by the bush. We will take it for granted that you have a piece of good fertile ground surrounding your home — in fact, when choosing a site on which to build your hoinc. have a thought for the beauty of the surrounding landscape, and plan for a harmonious whole. Nature does a great deal for us in helping to beautify our stat&lt;-. and my advice is to follow nature in your views of this preliminary work. If you have any ideas of balloon-shaped trees, dispel them at once and endeavor to grow your trees and shrubs in nearly their natural shape. If you can get a fence, do so. There are now many good cheap wire fences made which will answer the purpose. If you cannot fence, do not be discouraged, but plant trees and strong-growing shrubs anyhow. I know of a lady in Cass county who was so interested in home adornment that she made a bargain with her husband that she should hare all the surplus change when he returned from town after buying the week's supply of groceries, etc. The result was that in a very short time she had a nice fence around their home, and when I saw it some years ago it was the admiration of all pass - ers-by. Any lady interested might try this scheme. Thorough plowing or deep stirring of the soil before planting is essential. It is also desirable to mix well with the soil some thoroughly decomposed manure as a fertilizer. When ready to plant, carefully study out the effect of your trees, shrubs, and plants, not for the first two or three years only, but in years to come when they have attained a goodly sise. Plant so they will not be crowded; also plant with the vi. \ hiding all unsightly objects. such as out-houses, etc. Vines will </seg>
            <seg id="p141">140 answer this purpose if the place will not allow of planting shrubs. Leave as spacious a lawn as possible. Do not try to get all the ground covered with shrubbery and plants. Seed or sod the space left for lawu. A mixture of English rye grass and bluegrass makes a very good combination. A little white clover may be added if clover is preferred, but this has a tend - ency to monopolize the ground and smother out the young blue - grass, as the clover comes up before it. The rye grass is used for a nurse crop for the bluegrass, and being a large seed, sprouts more quickly and is usually up in a week or so if the weather is favorable. It takes bluegrass twenty days to fi&lt;r minute. Do not sow among your shrubbery, but keep this thoroughly cultivated and mulched with rotten manure, which is always plentiful in rural districts. If you desire a hedge fence as a screen or wind-break on any side, you can use small Russian mulberry, or berberry. Either the common green leaved berberry, or this and the purple leaved berberry planted alternately, produces a pretty effect. I will now name a few plants and shrubs suitable for planting: Flowering Almond.- — A beautiful shrub with pink and white blossoms, the flowers appearing in earl} 7 spring before the leaves put out. Tree Honeysuckles. — Growing in a bushlike form with pretty pink blossoms dotted all over it. LUacs. — These are familiar to everyone, and make a splendid shrub if given enough space to grow. There are a number of varieties; the common purple, white, and Persian are all good. Snotcballs. — These are always appreciated at time of blooming, and nothing pays for good treatment better than these shrubs. Bpireas. — The Van Houttci and Prunifolia or "Bridal Wreath" are invaluable. They transplant easily and bloom freely the first year, with long wreath-like branches of white flowers. Syringa, or Mock Orange. — This must not be passed by; there are many varieties which pay well for good treatment. Calycanthus. — These will seem to be a failure the first year or two, but after they attain some size they grow more rapidly. » </seg>
            <seg id="p142">PLANTS SUITABLE FOR THE FARM HOME. 141 Tamarix Amaurensis. — This shrub will more than repay for planting. It withstands drouth remarkably well, and its pleas ing appearance, with its feathery green foliage tipped with pink blossoms, makes it one of the most desirable shrubs. Hydrangea Paniculata Grandiflora. — This produces a fine effect with its large bunches of white flowers, and pays well for good attention. « Moss Acacia. — This shrub gives good satisfaction, with its racemes of pink flowers appearing before the leaves. Among the climbers, the common woodbine or Ampelopsis quinqucfolia makes a rapid covering and does well everywhere. Clematis pnuiculatn is a good climber and covers space freely. CUnuttix javkmanii does well in localities, and its large purple flowers pay well for a little attention in covering, which it needs. Honeysuckles, trumpet flower or coral, Chinese and Hallcana, all are useful as climbers. Bignonia radicans, or Trumpet Flower, must not be forgotten, making a very pretty climber with trumpet-like flowers. Climbing roses, Prairie Queen, Baltimore Belle, and Crimson Rambler, can be used with assurance of success. Herbaceous Phlox, of which there are many varieties, are pretty plants. PaBonies of various colors, liliums, Yucca filamentosa, all go to make up a beautiful collection for the shrubbery border. We must not forget roses, Hybrid Perpetual and. Teas. The first named are nearly all hardy, but repay for covering in fall. Tea roses can be lifted and packed away in a cellar or cool pi and replanted in spring, giving good results. Geraniums, t bed, must not be overlooked. The planter must choose for him - self, as there are so many varieties and colors. Cannas are almost indispensable, requiring good rich ground and thorough cultivation. Dahlias and gladioli bulbs can be planted annually and lifted in the fall and stored away in the cellar in moist sand, not tret. Pansies pay well for trouble expended by the pleasant look on their pretty faces, trying in their flower language to thank you for good treatment. Verbenas, Phlox drummondii, French and </seg>
            <seg id="p143">142 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. African marigolds, zenias, fill up space where needed. I might also mention hollyhocks, which can be raised from seed sown in early fall; Sweet Williams, sown at same time; grass pinks, which can be safely propagated by division. All of these are perfectly hardy and will help to fill spaces in our shrubbery border. I cannot close this paper without making a few remarks. What an opportunity for the boys and girls in our rural dis - tricts to take up this work and help beautify their homes, at the same time being able to give attention to the studies which these opportunities afford. And in writing this I am not forgetting the school grounds, and I urge the directors of school districts to take this matter under serious consideration and proceed to beautify the surroundings of these glorious institutions of learn - ing — the pride of our country. BULBS. BY L. C. CHAPIN, LINCOLN. I will first take up fall bulbs. By this I mean bulbs that are planted in the fall, live through the winter and bloom in early spring. The treatment is the same for all. Select the spot wanted in some open space where it will get the sunshine ivct not in too early a place). Spade up to a depth of at least four - teen or sixteen inches; add a little well-rotted manure; plant the bulbs right side up six inches below the surface of the ground and from four to six inches apart. Just before freezing up, cover the ground with leaves, straw, or litter about four to six inches deep, this covering to be removed early in the spring. This treatment is for hyacinths, tulips, crocus, snowdrops, jon - quils, narcissus, of all kinds and colors. These will begin to bloom even before snow is over, and by May 15 will be in full blast. After blooming the bulbs may be taken up and put away, or, better, left in the ground and other flowers planted in the </seg>

Prepare the ground as directed above, and plant ■ the same. They need no covering whatever, but in about four years they will need to be taken up, the crowns divided, and replanted. As to the beauty and fragrance of lilies of the valley, no words of mine are needed. Lilies of all kinds, such as Tiger, Candidum, Auratuin, should be planted by themselves in some bright sunny spot, protected from the winds, and by selecting several kinds bloom may be had nearly all season. Prepare the soil same as above. As to varieties, would suggest the following: Lilium Candidum, Auratum, Rubrum, Album, Brownii, Tigrinum (Tiger). Tuberoses and gladioli should be planted in spring and earlj summer. Prepare the ground by spading up to a depth of eight to twelve inches, and plant two inches under ground. Plant a few bulbs every week up till June 15; in this way a continual bloom may be had. After frost cut off the tops, let the bulbs dry out, and then place them in the cellar and plant again next ("annas have now become one of our best and most satisfac - tory summer flowering plants, as well as decorative, the blooms being borne on long spikes of six to twelve flowers each, and keep up a continual bloom from June till frost. As to varieties, there are fifty or one hundred now of good ones in all colors and shades. The bulbs should be planted in ground spaded to a good depth, removing enough earth to leave the surface of the bed a little below the level of the ground, as, in order to do their best they must have plenty of water. Plant deep enough to cover top of crown an inch or two, and stir the soil occasionally to keep down the weeds, and you will find that you have dis - covered a "thing of beauty and a joy forever." As soon as frost comes, cut off the tops, dry the roots, and pack in a box with dry earth in the cellar. These roots are as easy to keep as po - tatoes. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">Dahlias are beautiful, and are of the same culture as above. However, I would advise you to go slowly, for as yet they have not been very satisfactory in our windy climate. All bulbs are of easy culture, and are almost sure to bloom - profusely. They are now getting cheap enough to be within the reach of all. NEBRASKA AS A NUT-GBOWING STATE. BY E. CORBIX, GRAND ISLAND Mr. President and ilcntlcnien of the Horticultural Society: I have taken a subject which has been on my mind for a number of years, and before I get through I think I can convince all that they can grow several of the nut-bearing trees so as to supply themselves, and at a profit for market. For about six years I have had on my mind this idea: That Nebraska has at one time been a vast timber state like New York and Michigan; that in ages long passed by — even before the glacial age — these broad prairies were covered heavily with timber, and that among them grew many trees that are not what we call today native to Nebraska. Therefore I wish to make a few remarks as to why I think Nebraska is a state in which we could grow many of the nut-bearing trees now growing in New York, Ohio, and the older eastern states. First — They grew here at some time in the past and mett here in great forests; that is, were native here, as I said, before the glacial age. I get my foundation for this belief from the great record keeper, geology, and from what I find buried in the archives of the earth. In the years 1873 to 1877 I was in western Wyoming on both slopes of the Rocky mountain range. There I became acquainted with Professor Smith, who was under the pay of Professor Marsh, of Yale College. He was then gathering .and getting out those wonders in the fossils that are so famous in the Marsh collection. I was with him </seg>
            <seg id="p146">NKItRASKA AS A NUT-OROWING STATE. 145 when he unearthed sonic of them. At this time the Haden ex - ploration of the territories had just passed and I gathei points from them. I also had the fortune to tind some fossil deposits, also one in particular of vegetable deposit, where there Hie mam very rich specimens from the vegetable world, where they had been buried for many ages and some of them verj rare. I have always regretted that this particular place COoU not be ojH'iied up more. Some of those I gave to the Smith - sonian Institution at Washington, and others to the University at Syracuse when Prof. Winchell was there, and he said they were very rate. After I found this deposit of vegetable - iniens I met .Mr. Claybourne, of Omaha, who was in the 'civil engineering department of the I'nion Pacific railway. He was well posted on botany, and with him I went to this deposit and spent a day or two getting out specimens. He was much inter - ested in these buried records, and from him I learned many of the names of these plants I had found recorded on the rocks. He also showed me growing wild the tobacco plant from which our tobacco lias been brought up to its present state by culture, also several other plants which culture has brought up to their present state of perfection. IJut to go back -to the records in the rocks. It is certain that all the region north of central Kansas, and eastward along the Ohio river, and on to the Atlantic ocean, and westward past southern Colorado and on west to the Pacific — a region taking in from one hundred to one hundred and fifty miles south of the presort line of the V. P. railway, was once a tropical region, and the climate for many thousands of years was much like that of Florida and the Gulf states. It is also shown that this vast region was once covered with a sea of/ fresh water, and that what land there was not covered was the home of those prehistoric animals which lived in these tropical forests. We find in the record of the rocks eight varieties of palms, the same as today grow native in central America; seven varieties of magnolia, native only of the tropics or semi-tropics; four or tive 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p147">varieties of grapes; two or three of willow, maple, plum, walnut, palmetto, butternut, chestnut, hickory, and many other varieties of trees, tropical and semi-tropical. We also found over twenty varieties of ferns and reeds, many of these grasses of the south, club mosses, and also the seeds of the wild cucumber in the shale rock covering the upper part of the coal deposit. Now over all this came a great salt ocean which held this great region for many, many ages; yet, long enough to give an ana of over fifty square miles of oyster bed. This deposit where it crops out at point of rocks is over sixteen feet deep. Now. us ages on ages passed, this region became covered with ice, and glacial age was on all these animals and plants. &lt;).\ - are buried under the deposits of rock, gravel, sand, and earth left by the glaciers to a depth of from thirty to sixty feet, and are found as they were cut through by the water which cut out the canyons on the slopes of the Rockies. And still more the records under^where we now live tell the same story of the timber of Nebraska in ages past. In 1887 to 1890 I was putting down the large caisson wells, sixteen feet in diameter, used by the U. P. railway for water to supply their engines. These wells were located along the U. P. railway from the pine bluffs in western Nebraska to Genoa and Stromsburg in eastern Nebraska. In all these wells I found at the depth of from fifteen to forty feet different kinds of wood. Among them were cottonwood, cedar, willow, plum, wild cherry, black walnut and several other kinds that we could not deter - mine to a certainty. I also found among them the bones of the hog, beaver, rhinoceros, tiger, elephant, rabbit. Some of those I found can be seen in the University museum upstairs. At Genoa, in Nance county, I found the best specimens in a well seven feet down. At the depth of twenty-three feet I began to find different kinds of wood; large cottonwood over one foot through, willow, plum, hazelwood, hickory, shagbark, and black walnut. The bark of the shagbark hickory was as perfect as if just taken off the tree. We found also butternut. As we went down farther we came to a very coarse gravel deposit full of </seg>
            <seg id="p148">147 NEBRASKA AS A NUT-ORO-WINQ STATE. water. This at ■ depth of thirty feet. It Memed to be a sort of wmdktrgwm mA itiettfe as it tame in from a northwest eeMM and went out at a southeast. Here we found large pieo wood showing the marks where they had been cut off by the beavers' teeth. We found also i&gt;erfect butternuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, hickory nuts, also the horns of buffalo, antelope, and deer, and they coining in with the current of the water. Some Cf the varieties we could not tell to a certainty whether chest ut or cucumber. So from this I say that at some time in past ages all these nut-bearing trees were native here. Some are here now. I have often said, in planting trees for shade or ornament, why not take the useful with the ornamental, and by combining the two effect a great gain. While east this summer this, to me, became more of a settled idea. I saw where between twenty-five and thirty years ago were put out along the roads the butternut, chestnut, horse chestnut, and along the roads and around city lots nut trees were planted. They are better than the old forest trees and the owners are getting a reward in the nuts. The trees stood thirty to forty feet high, smooth, symmetrical, and beautiful as one need look at. They were not like our box elder — crooked, ill-shai&gt;ed, broken off on one side, full of dead limbs, covered with red bugs and full of borers; but these nut trees were smooth, healthy, perfect in form and full of fruit. The wood of the chestnut is one of the very best for finishing lumber known, and as it gets age it will rival the black walnut for this purpose. My old home church at Liverpool, N. Y., was buiit in L883-4 and all finished with chestnut — doors, casing, wain ing, window sash, pews, all in chestnut, and it is one of the finest in the east for a small church. Now, some ask, "Will these nut trees grow in Nebraska?" Yes, at Grand Island; yes, at Waterloo; yes, in Polk county, south of the Platte river; yes, in Kearney, also in the south and south-central part of the state. Ten years ago Mr. Baker pur - chased four two year old chestnut trees from some agent from western Iowa. He put them out, and after growing two years </seg>
            <seg id="p149">148 148 NEBRASKA STATE HonTtCIT.TJ-UAI. SOCIETY. two of then were broken off .but cuae op again from the root. The other two arc much larger; one is four inches in diameter at the butt and from sixteen to twenty feet high. This tree has been fruiting in abundance for three years, and this year ilSUTi bore a ]M-ck of chestnuts. The other is about six inches at the butt and is from twenty-five to thirty feet high, and bore about six quarts of chestnuts in 1897. I saw two chestnut trees in Polk county not over ten feet high with chestnut burrs on, and I presume they had nuts as it was tot) early in the season to know. I saw butternut trees near Waterloo only ten years old from seed with a good crop on for size of trees. About thirty years ago a man from New York put out a lot of butternuts on his place near Waterloo; today they are large -trees, about fif - teen to eighteen inches through, and have been in bearing for over twenty years and have very large crops on every year. Since writing the above 1 have heard of several other places in Nebraska where chestnut and butternut trees not over ten years from seed are in bearing. From this I say, why not en - courage our farmers and farmer boys to plant nut trees along the roads? Alternate with chestnut and butternut, or put in with them some cherry or black walnut, and it will be but half a generation before they will be in full bearing. The wood of the chestnut is almost as lasting for post - red cedar. In the first year these nut trees need care lest tliev should get dry. Keep them well watered, and after they are once well started they will take care of themselves. And 1 say that instead of planting for shade along city lots or on farms, put out cherry, plum, peach or nut trees. Let's get rid of the box elder I have not had so much experience with nut trees myself, but from what I see of them I say. let's make a trial of them, and I hope to get a number interested this year so we can learn more about nut trees in Nebraska. I shall make a trial this year of starting them from seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">149 Owiag to the great loss in nursery and orchard the past win - ter, tin- i|iiestion of parchasiag omrwaj stock (ever the gr&lt;-. impediment to extensive piantiag) is forced upon us with in - creased interest. That we will plant, need not he questioned; the thousands of dollars sent out of the state each year for fruit should be kept at home. All of the fruit, used in the state — green, canned, and dried — capable of being produced in this latitude, should be grown within our borders. If "lie who makes two blades of brass grow where but one grew before" deserves praise, what is due to the man who makes a fruit tree grow and blyssom where only a cactus grew before? Fruit is nature's own apothecary shop; and he who supplies plenty of good ripe fruit for the family at all seasons will avoid doctors' bills suffi - cient to pay first cost of planting; and the contrast between taking the two prescriptions — the doctor's bitter pills, or his own luscious strawberries and delicious cherries — will more than compensate for time and trouble in caring for the fruit. The man who puts large quantities of fruit on the market not only fills his own coffers, but is a public benefactor and an enemy of the homeopath. The people of Nebraska should plant ten times as many fruit trees in the next five years as they hav in the past decade. The purchase money will involve thousands of dollars; more, possibly, than the farmers of Nebraska pay for life insurance, and as all nurserymen are not honest, it might be well to ask the government to appoint an EL &lt;&gt;.

Why, I knew one state agent to come all the way from Lincoln to Johnson to talk with one of these influential citizens — who he had learned wanted to plant five hundred trees — when he might have stayed in Lincoln and talked to the governor! A plan worked extensively in Lancaster county a few jean ago was the "Model Orchard," in which the fanner and tree agent were partners. The agent agreed with a few "prominent" farmers to furnish them stock at one-half list price in cash, the agent to have the crop of fruit the third year from planting as balance. Now. the "Model Orchard" was made up mostly of specialties — a few apple trees at reasonable rates, and the balance were high-priced grapes, cherries, etc. One article I specially remember in the orchard I visited was four doaen dewberries at |5 per doz. The stock was delivered: the "prom inent farmer" paid his half list price as agreed, and is still wait - ing for the agent to claim his crop of fruit. But that cat never came back. Then again, the sliek-tongued agent has trees that are grafted by a patent method, "used only by our nursery," of course, "making our trees worth twenty times as much as any Ne - braska-grown trees."'

Hogg: I think ihis would be a very good time to n up a selection of varieties to recommend for planting in diflV parts of. the state. We have recently passed through extremes of our climate; we have had a summer of unusual and drouth, and a winter of unusual cold. These extremes have severely tried many of our orchards, yet we find today that we have varieties that have stood both these extremes. It seems to me it would be well for us to go through our orchards now, examine our trees carefully, and recommend for planting only those varieties that have stood the test in bothi' doing this I believe we can save millions of dollars to the fruit growers of the state in the future. In my orchard I have - varieties that have been standing there thirteen or four years; I have been waiting for them to come into bearing, hop - ing they would at least pay for the trouble and expense they have been to inc. and today they are killed by the winter — ab - solutely worthless.

You will find small patches of half an acre — or even two or three rods square — of land that has a hard subsoil; again you will find it extend ing over whole areas. You will find a loose, easily penetr subsoil, and a subsoil that is almost as hard as a rock, on the same acre of ground. Ex-Gov.

I have not lost any of the faith I had in subsoil preparation for planting trees, but I rei&gt;eat that the past season has pretty nearly upset all theories, and 1 find some things that I have not been able to understand. I have been trying Prof. Bessey, Prof. Swezey. and the other scientists at Lincoln, but none of them haVe been able to give any correct theory upon which we may rely. So. as I said to Prof. Bessey in writing him not long since, I fall back upon the old Biblical statement that two men should be in the field, one should be taken and the other left; two women should be grind - ing, one should be taken and the other left. I think, however, there is something in location. I have always argued aa a theory that we wanted a northern or western slope, but this year I have my best showing on southern and eastern exposures, which upsets all the old theories in regard to northern and west - ern slopes.

It is to help, if possible, those who desire to have burial places, in their main features, like those of the cities. It is certain we cannot have their imposing gateways, chapels, and receiving vaults, but these are luxurious embellishments, not essentials. Nature's good things, from the perennial blue- </seg>
            <seg id="p160">159 RtTRA I M to the grateful white elm, are at home with us, too. Our cemeteries can also be planned for paths, walks, drives, and views, and many other improvements, though these may not all come for many years. The principal object is to adopt such plans as will encourage each succeeding- generation of our famili make further improvements. With room for continuous burials and possibilities of additional embellishments they will not only continue what we have begun, but they will refer to our fore - sight and work with gratitude and pride. "While there are thousands of abandoned cemeteries in this country, it is said on good authority that not one capable of continuous use and improvement has been thus abandoned. Hence it is plain to see what is needed to make a burying ground a perpetual cemetery — an opportunity for continuous use and continuous improve - ment, combined with the organization outlined by our statutes. These statutory requirements are that not less than five persons may incorporate themselves, when the state will protect them in doing any and every reasonable act they ■ lit to do during their lives and the lives of their successors for all time. The first and most important matter is that these persons fully agree as to what is desirable in a cemetery; that they are previously acquainted with each other; that each has unbounded confidence in the integrity of the other four; that each has the courage to face left handed applause with composure; and that tmeh has a little money to spare to pay for a good thing. No one should expect that a cemetery can be made to pay for itself in the sense that a wheat crop pays. Those who invest in this should do so with the understanding that it pays in the same sense that ornamental planting in oar front yards i It seems fitting that those who have lived surrounded by na hue's beauties should sleep in their midst, too. It is best that the association shall be made up of a few indi - viduals, and that they be members of large families, being rep resentatives of their respective families; then when one fails another of the same family can be chosen, thos giving more like - lihood of continuity of purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">160 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. Each member of the original association should hold his posi tion by articles of incorporation (taring his pleasure, during his lifetime, or during his continued residence in the vicinity. When one place becomes vacant by law — that is, there being ;han five members left — the four remaining should at once elect one from MMBg the lot owners. They will, of course, elect one who will help to continue what has beeH began; one who sees the whole matter in the same light as they do; one who is worthy to take the place of the'lost one. The principle is that those who begin a good work, the means of which comes out of their own pockets — those who furnish the judgment and run the risks of failure, shall not, ought not, and need not be turned out the moment the undertaking becomes an assured success. Then a large majority of those who have bought one grave space, or the least permissible sized lot, are not sufficiently interested to be qualified to vote in cemetery management. If anyone does not like this undemocratic way of doing, he need not buy therein. Jt should be distinctly understood that no person has a right to buy any lot lie may choose. The association should exercise great care as to whom it sells its large lots. It isn't money alone that the association needs; it is an abiding interest of « family ab v e and willing to help carry on the cemetery in the decades and centuries to come that is needed. Sell to such or hold the lots. The active usefulness of an American count r\ graveyard is approximately fifty years; then the lots of those who have public spirit to care for them are full; then as no land can be bought adjoining, another ground must be chosen, and as few families feel able to support two graveyards, the old one is abandoned. The owner of the farm from which the land was taken keeps up the road fence for self protection; the inside fences, already old, go down by decay and gravitation; the tomb stones go out of sight, by shame and gravitation, but the old graveyard, not to encumber the earth, joins heartily in the tin expressed desire of the neighborhood that all of the sad scenes enacted therein be effaced from sight, as they soon will be from the memory of man, and at once produces annually a luxuriant </seg>

As this gnm patch has not been run down by cropping during the past half century, has been self-fertilized as well as artificially en - riched continually, the bluegrass is remarkable as to quality and quantity. And herein lies the difficulty of buying adjoining land; the owner of which, seeing an acre coming to him by peace - ful occupancy, naturally asks the value of it added to the price of what is wanted, and the community, not willing to pay for their forefathers' lack of foresight, go elsewhere. And this shortsightedness is repeated. I know of dozens of graveyards thus abandoned, while I do not know of one piece of ground that merits the name of cemetery that has thus been deserted. Hence one of two events is extremely like to come to all burying grounds: The many now used will be wiped out; the few will be retained, continually becoming, as the generations go by, more and more the centers of reverence for the past, and of inspira - tion for the future. This cemetery to be proud of, and to be a permanent embel - lishment to a community, is never built up except through the most energetic opposition of a majority. One complains of one thing, another of another, and seldom anyone buys a lot until he is compelled to. And then he feels abused by those who have been working ten or twenty years to prepare a suitable resting place for his dead. While a cemetery should be managed by those who pay for it, they should understand and feel that it is for the repose of the rich and poor alike, and therefore they should incur no ex - pense for mere display of wealth. Do nothing as individuals but what the soil, trees, shrubs, plants and grass, guided by good judgment, can help do. These are equally within ■■ of all. No matter how poor a man may be, his child's grave may be kept pretty and sweet without money and without price. No burial ground can rise to the rank of cemetery without the trustees, through the superintendent, having control of all planting; still, as a matter of fact, this power is not often needed. Ike trustees are only too glad to have lot-owners plant 11 </seg>

The great difficulty is in getting pay for lots and work. ()n&lt; - half of this is done away with when it is once understood that a cemetery association is not a charitable association. It is barred by law from profit, hence it has nothing to give; it must pay for everything it buys, and, therefore, must have pay for everything it sells or its members are defrauded. The other half of the difficulty is gone when it is clearly understood that in any possible case of poverty someone is able and ready to pay. If the nearest of kin cannot, there are several possibilities before we reach the county commissioner, who is by law ready and able. Do not give a warranty deed for lots sold. Copy from the statutes and deed the right of "sole interments." It is claimed to be by far the best way to sell lots at such a price as will justify the association in forever caring for themi It will be exceedingly difficult to do this in the present state of public opinion. I am not satisfied that it is best even if pos - sible. Let us make a cemetery that is so enduring as to plans, business management, and embellishment, having room for the large lot-owners to bury their dead for at least one hundred and fifty years — five generations — that the community may be proud of it. Then let us trust that our descendants will have as good ability and taste as we have; that they will have the same revcr ence for the past, and the same hopes for their descendants that we have. If an association will keep back plenty of large lots, though it may have to close its ground against the single grave and small buyers, it will be more likely to be successful. There are now families in every precinct that will be willing to paj as lot-owners near our large cities whenever it is made probable to them that they are to have a lasting cemetery. These are the families to be attracted, the more of them the better, and the less of the single grave space buyers the better. The former will, in their descendants, be in the nature (if an endowment. </seg>

Hence, to be self supporting, they should pay such a sum as put at interest will bring enough interest each year to keep their grounds in order and help fence the ground, together with the &lt; -ost of the grave space up to date of buying. My information is that this space ought not to l&gt;e sold for less than ten dollars. this amount to go into a perpetual care fund, the interest only of which is to be used. The transition from total neglect to perjH'tual care of the hole cemetery will be a difficult and slow pro nietery cannot be a most beautiful one while a par le lots are neglected and a part are well cared for. The hole ground must lyive good care. Then individual lots may be highly embellished to the general advantage; but while one &gt;t grows to weeds it will be as part of a frame to the next, owever well kept that may be. Hence it is for the int. ' all those who desire a beautiful cemetery that every one lall pay for good perpetual care. Those who do not desire to »ay for this had better go where weeds and neglect are willingly emitted, or join together and buy land and give it away. Another matter is not to be forgotten. Any one of the i ation has no more rights in his cemetery than any other lot wner who is not a member of the association. The members [ the association have duties to perform and responsibilities &gt; bear, but they have not one additional right. They arc barred v law from any profit therefrom. Every dollar of income must e faithfully expended for the use or embellishment of the inetery. It is of no more interest to the trustees to receive a arge price for a lot than it is for the lot owner. The money ■ceived is put to the improvement of the cemetery as a whole. Those who resjM-ct their dead will desire a cemetery where exact records of burials have been kept from the beginning so that the location of the remains of every person buried therein can be determined from a book record made at the time of in - terment. If this record is kept in triplicate so that the three </seg>
            <seg id="p165">164 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. copies shall never be under the same roof at the same time, loss by fire is not probable. Without this exactness and pre - caution, no cemetery is well kept. If these measures are not taken at the time of first burials there will be confusion, for which there is no remedy. Nothing but this exactness, faithfully carried out by courageous men, will prevent the bones of our dead from being innocently disturbed to make room for strangers. There are probably burying grounds enough in number in every county in the state. The mass of our people arc satis fled with them. Before these grounds are full is the time to begin cemeteries which will be a credit to our beautiful coun - try, worthy of ourselves, a never ending pleasure to our pos - terity, sacred to our dead, sacred to our memory, sacred to our posterity forever.

I am not a cemetery superintendent, nor has the subject of land - scape gardening come much within my study, yet I have always had this theory: That I should prefer to be put in the ground in some place where the trees, shrubs and plants of all sorts grew almost as nature grows them. This morning as Mr. He- Intosh and I left Mr. Aldrich'l house we went cross lots, and the thought came to me (I hough I didn't say anything about it because I didn't want to bring any such solemn thoughts into Mr. Mclntosh's mind) that there would be a good place to be buried; where the foliage came down to the very ground. I wonder that in so many of our cemeteries the trees are trimmed up; or if not trimmed op, standing so far apart that one can see the monuments between them. It seems to me we should make the cemetery as much as possible a forest with forest paths — not gravel, but just such roads as we went through this </seg>

In the year 1866 a very prominent horticulturist and land cape gardener, Albert St ranch, a German by birth, who was ppoifited at that date as sui&gt;eiintendent of Spring Grove Ceme - ery, Cincinnati. O.. su^ested putting into practical use this ystem of cemetery, which had been recommended as early as 832 by J. c. Louden, one of the most prominent horticultural nd botanies] writers of his day. Since the introduction of his system at Cincinnati, all of the larger and many of the mailer cities, one by one, have adopted the same plan, until oday the park or lawn cemeteries of the United States are ac - knowledged to be the model remeteries of the civilized world. While it is not a pleasant duty to bring this matter before you at this time, you will all agree with me that death is certain </seg>
            <seg id="p167">166 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. With all of us sooner or later. Therefore it becomes our duty as horticulturists to take the initiative move in eliminating the cause of this dread of visiting our cemeteries by making them as beautiful as we possibly can. And to accomplish this end I would recommend as my tirst reason for adopting the lawn system of cemetery, its economy of construction and operation. It matters not whether it be the large cemetery in the city, or the smaller one in the rural district, the principles are the same. The lawn or park cemetery is so constructed as to take advan of the natural topography of the ground. No more avenues than are absolutely necessary for practical purjjoses -{which may be from 980 to (JIM) feet apart) are admissible. These ave nues have two functions to perform: First, a means by which an reach the different parts of the cemetery. Second, they should be so located that the surface water can be conducted along them in sewers or in open ditches as the case may be. Consequently they usually follow the lowest portions of the ground, or lead to those portions. Cemetery lots are always more valuable above the level of the avenues than below. Ave - nues may be curved in any graceful manner so as to reach any prominent object desired, to the advantage of the general plans. Straight lines ought to be avoided when practicable When the avenues are properly located, very little grading will be re quired. The economy of this system must be quite apparent, as unnecessary drives or walks are very expensive to keep in proper condition, and detract from the general appearance of the grounds. My second reason for adopting the lawn system is, simplicity of management. When the avenues are located as recom mended, the sections of ground between the avenues should be graded, if necessary, to look as if nature had planned the whole grounds. If the surface is undulating, so much the better, pro - vided the grades are not too steep. If there are any depressions on the surface which cannot be used — such as a lake — they must he tilled up until they will drain surface water off. This can be accomplished by cutting down some of the prominent knolls </seg>
            <seg id="p168">167 WHY COUNTRY CEMETERIES SHOULD ADOPT LAWN SYSTEM. been reduced to the grade required, this should be accepted as the established grade and should not be changed for any cause unless for something of special importance such as the building of vaults, which need affect but a small portion in the immediate vicinity. Lots should be staked out on such sections to coincide with the curves of the avenues. Whatever walks are necessary must be kept in grass and on the same level as the general surface of the lots. This applies to single interment departments with equal force as to family lots. Graves are tamped thoroughly while being filled, consequently they settle but ,very little and are left but little above the surface — Just enough to keep out the surface water. No fencing of individual lots or «oping of stone or other material around lots is admis - sible. Only one monument should be allowed to one lot, and this must be set on proper foundation, suitable in size and depth to weight of structure to be received. No marker should exceed one foot in height above the level of the ground — or, better still, should be level with the ground — with foundation in pro - portion to size. A space of ground should be set apart in every cemetery for single interments. The management of such cem - eteries will be very much simplified by adhering to such rules. You will readily perceive that the grounds being free from fences or mounds, a great deal of the work can be done by horse power. My third reason for adopting the park or lawn system is Hi beauty; or rather, to form a consistent whole. Individual in - terests will be lost sight of and the embellishment of the ground must be under one controlling taste, subservient, of course, to some general plan which has been adopted by those interested. I would set aside a sj&gt;;i&lt; •&lt;• of ground twenty feet or more in width on the inside of the boundary fence on all sides for orna - mental purposes. This enables the management to plant tree* and shrubs quite liberally. This will form a background to the mmmty which will at once convey the idea intended: that of a quiet secluded nook of nature, away from the busy bustle of </seg>
            <seg id="p169">168 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. the business world, where we can go and commune with the beauties of nature while we are visiting the resting pla&gt; our dead. The planting of trees and shrubs in the interior of a cemetery is somewhat more difficult to arrange than for a pleasure park, for the reason that all the available pond must be staked out in lots for the practical purposes for which it was intended. Consequently the trees must be arranged with thai in view at all times, though the landscape effect must never be lost sight of. The corners of the sections at the junctions of all avenues may be planted for some little distance from the junction, and any prominent knolls may be made still more sn by planting clumps of trees and shrubs. But vistas of beautiful open lawn are of great importance, when the planting will be confined to a beautiful single specimen of tree or shrub, or possibly two or three to form a background for some beautiful work of art that may be located in the cemetery. The whole will exhibit a grace and dignity which cannot be obtained where single lots are planted indiscriminately. The centralizing of rural cemeteries has been very highly rec - ommended by writers in the Park and Cemetery from time to time, and all who are interested in the improvement of loue - teries should subscribe for that monthly periodical, which is published exclusively in the interests of cemeteries. The editor and publisher, Mr. R. J. Haight. 134 Dearborn St.. Chicago, and his staff, are thoroughly competent and always glad to answer any questions that may arise in cemetery management. CULTIVATING THE ORCHARD. BY T. E. SNODGRASS, JOHNSON. The cultivation of an orchard is of as much importance as the cultivation of any other crop. No one thinks of planting com and letting it grow up in weeds. On the contrary the land </seg>
            <seg id="p170">169 CULTIVATING THE ORCHARD. is kept in the best possible condition. The cultivator and har - row are kept going constantly. Then why should the orchard be allowed to grow up to weeds and grass? Everyone in this section cultivates the orchard as long as it will pay to grow crops of some kind between the rows of trees, after which cultivation stops. This is certainly a mistake. My experience is that there is no time to stop cultivating until the trees are dead. When the crops between the rows no longer pay, the trees havo commenced to bear fruit. The trees still need to be kept growing, and it costs them something to ripen their fruit, hence a double need of cultivation. The object of cultivation is to retain the moisture of spring and early summer for August and September. In these two months the winter apples make their greatest growth, and to ripen the seeds in an apple takes a great amount of moisture. During these two months we are apt to be short of moisture, and this is the time of vear to see the difference between an or - chard that is choked with a blue grass or timothy sod and one that has been well cultivated. For lack of moisture the former has made little or no growth: the apples are small and uneven, and worst of all, they lack flavor. On the other hand, the latter has made a good growth, the apples are large and even, well colored, and the flavor excellent. Besides, the fruit buds for the next crop are strong and healthy. We usually have sufficient rainfall if we take the precaution to preserve it. The best possible way to do this is by forming a dust blanket on the top soil. Mulching answers the same purpose, but is too expensive and inconvenient. Besides, mulch - ing brings the feeders too near the top of the soil. Cultivation causes the roots of a tree to grow deep, thus avoiding in a meas - ure the effects of the scorching summer sun, giving larger and finer fruit. An orchard that has been cultivated throughout the season holds its fruit much better in the fall than one in weeds or grass. An orchard should be cultivated as soon as possible after each rain. Evaporation goes on very rapidly, </seg>
            <seg id="p171">and if not cultivated wo as to break up the little cells formed by capillary attraction, the moisture in the soil is soon lost. Next best to cultivation is a growth of weeds provided they are mewed — or, better still, plowed under before they ripen their seeds. This makes humus in the soil, and there is nothing much better to hold moisture than humus. A common mistake is to cultivate near the trunk of the tree and let the balance go uncultivated, or to put manure close around the trunk. This is not where the feeders are; they are out as far as the ends of the limbs. BIKI&gt;S AND HORTICULTURE. BY MRS. I. J. BALL, BROCK. It no doubt seems presumptuous for me to sj&gt;eak to you of birds; you who have been their daily companions for years as you traversed the meadows and woodlands; while I have known them mostly by their fjlad songs as they came in through the ojHTi window where I busied myself with household toil. The subject as I have chosen it is: "Tan We Afford to Kill Our Birds?" As the money question is the all-absorbing theme of today, we say again, "Can we afford it?" Let us stop for a moment to consider the slaughter that is daily carried on ajrainst their defenseless lives, and then repeat the question uttered eighteen hundred years ago: "Why, what evil hath he done we mean to deal in dollars and cents, we will not mention the solace his frlad note has been to us in sorrow or illness: that was beyond the price of money to buy; but let us deal in hard, cold facts, and try to learn what the bird is really worth to us. Were it not for these little friends the earth would soon be overrun with insects. Those who have studied the subject affirm that the agriculturist is deeply indebted to them. Yet these benefactors are ruthlessly shot down by any ignorant lad who can gel hold of a gOB. The merciless dest i kills at random everything that is clothed in feathers; kills in </seg>
            <seg id="p172">one day's ■hooting, perhaps, the author of more good to the public at large tlian he will be able to confer upon his country or society in a lifetime. From a rough calculation it is • mated that many millions of insectivorous birds are kill" year. The hibold (or golden-winged woodpecker) is one of tli most persistent workers of the bird family. He seldom It an apple tree on which lie has searched for food until he has destroyed every insect upon it. Thus he is busily eagaged from morning till night, tipping every part of the tree as he for the worm that is slowly but sorely eating away its life, and hii instinct enables him to detect it where man would fail to do ho. Yet in Long Island alone over one hundred thousand of these beautiful birds are killed annually. Who does not love the robin and listen for his glad note as the herald of returning spring?. Prof. Lintner of New York e "The robin is one of our most useful birds, and its fondness for larva of all kinds, and its ability to obtain those that are hidden beneath the 'turf. give* it a usefulness for destroying cut-worms which no other bird possesses in the same degree; and for this alone its greater abundance should be encouraged." Prof. Forbes, of Illinois, says that in his examination of over stomachs of these birds during ten months of the year, he found the contents to consist of 04 per cent insects and .14 per fruit and seeds. Then he asks this question: "Will the destruc - tion of 17 quarts of average caterpillars, together with at least 8 quarts of cut-worms, pay for 24 quarts of then Its, grap currants?" and then answers in these words: 'I for my own part can only reply that I do not believe the horticulturist can sell his small fruit anywhere in the ordinary market at so high a price as to the robin."' I have lately read an account of two young sportsmen, who in one excursion, killed over thirty dozen, and in Long Island this bird is killed by the thousands — I believe statistics say about 250,000 every year. The indiscriminate slaughter of birds has so reduced their numbers that insect life has greatly increased, until it of the most serious plagues the farmer has to contend m </seg>
            <seg id="p173">172 The ravages they commit often spread universal havoc. The fruit trees are scourged with various curculio and other in - sects; the oats, wheat, rye and barley — in fact, every article grown for the benefit of man — is injured by them. Many of the forest trees all over the country have of late years sickened and died, destroyed by insects. On the hickory, walnut and many other trees, the Tiger Cermbyx deposits its eggs; the worm soon hatches, and. eating into the tree, makes a burrow two or three feet in length which in time kills it. We all know that the little English Kjmrrow was introduced into our coun - try during a scourge of geometrical worms which were eating away the leaves from the shade trees in Brooklyn and New York city. So bad had the scourge become that the worms would let themselves down on anyone who might pass beneath the trees. We know, too, what a short time it took the sparrows to dispatch this enemy of man's comfort. An investigation was made by scientific men to ascertain how many eggs a- single chickadee would eat, with surprising results; there being no difficulty in identifying the eggs of the canker worm which were found in the birds' stomachs, as a great portion of the shells remained intact. The number of eggs found in the stomachs of four of these birds amounted to 1,028. Thus we can see the good the birds are ever doing. It has been stated that a pair of house wrens have been observed to leave their nest and return with insects forty or sixty times an hour. In one particular hour the pair carried food no less than seventy-four times, and in this business they were engaged the greater part of the day. It may be interesting for some of you to know that cabbage millers are among the insects de - stroyed by these birds. I know a lady who found a double hand ful of their wings lying around the nest where parent birds had lately fed their young. Swallows and martins, too, live entirely on insects, and as they are always on the wing, they rid the atmosphere of nox - ious pests that but for their friendly aid would render the world unendurable to man. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">BIRDS AND HORTICULTURR. 173 It is not from the depredations of the masses of insect species that we lose our crops or suffer severe losses in a single &lt;1 tion, but from the few that at times beeOMC abnormally numer - ous, such as chinch bugs, grasshoppers, and, fresher still in our memories, the army worm. This being true, the bird naturally turns its attention to what is most numerous for the bulk of its food supply. Even a bird will not ignore food which is plentiful for that which is more difficult to obtain. Many of our birds migrate southward as winter approaches, yet a few remain with us all the year. Of course, those that remain must be fed, and if left to themselves they will find that food. They now change to a vegetable diet, of which they find a plentiful store in the numerous weeds, and, to man, useless seeds that lie about the ground. Even here the bird be - friends the tiller of the soil by searching out and destroying the seeds of many noxious weeds that would quickly grow up and occupy the ground to the disadvantage or destruction of that which is being cultivated. There are instances where a bird may be harmful part of the season and exceedingly beneficial the remaining part of the year. In such a case, if we apply business principles, we will carefully estimate both sides of the account before a sum - mary settlement is made by destroying the bird. In the red - winged blackbird we have a friend we little dream of when we see the large flocks gathering about our corn fields during late summer and early autumn. The balance of the year he is waging war against various insects, including such forms as the grub-worm, cut-worm, grasshopper, May beetle, army-worm, beet caterpillar, and many others. Even when he visits our cornfields he more than repays for the corn he eats by 1 1 1 • struction of the worms that lurk beneath the husks of a large per cent of the corn in every field. Several years ago the beet fields in the vicinity of (irand Island were threatened g injury by a certain caterpillar that had nearly defoliated the growing crop. About this time large flocks of these birds ap - peared and after a week's sojourn the caterpillar plagae had </seg>
            <seg id="p175">174 vanished. Yet man, in return for all these benefits, only re wards the little worker with death. Dnriag the fall season when the blackbirds begin to wing their way toward the south where they feed on wild oats and other seeds that grow along the reedy marshes, they are taken advantage of when they ■top for the Bight. As the reeds become dry, hunters surround the marshes, coming in under cover of the darkness. Fire is then set to the dry stocks on all sides and before the birds are fairly aroused, the tlames are blazing all about them. Scream ing with fright and stifled by the smoke and heat, they try to make their escape, only to be shot down in great numbers in the light the conflagration has kindled, while their terror and death mis furnish great fun for the sportsmen thus engaged. Tlie food habit of the turkey vulture, and the carrion crow, are of such nature that the destruction of these birds should be prohibited. They live almost exclusively on carrion, or decora - • 1 animal matter, and, in their manner, aid in the prevention of diseases that might result from the presence of such tilth. The hawks and owls, after careful investigation, have been pro nounced of great benefit to man. These birds, commonly looked upon as enemies of the farmer, and indiscriminately destroyed, really rank among his best friends, and with few exceptions, should be encouraged to take up their abode near his home. Only six of the seventy three species and subspecies of the hawks and owls of the United States are injurious, of these, three are so scarce that they need hardly be mentioned. Omit - ting the three specie* that feed largely on poultry and game, namely: Fisher-hawk, Sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawk — omitting these, 2,1'12 stomachs were examined of which ."&gt;(! per cent contained mice, and what is of more interest to us. rats, young rabbits and Other mammals; 27 per cent insects, and only :?i per cent poultry or game birds. I fear my long Betel may weary you. but permit me to men tion just one more, and that is the Bob-White Quail. Perhaps no other bird is so valuable to the farmer.

In fact, it only takes stray ker nels that otherwise would be lost. It is one of the few birds that feed upon that unsavory insect the chinch bug, and the num - ber of these that occasionally fall its prey is really astonishing. Quails" stomachs haw bee* found filled with them; more than "&gt;00, at least, having been sacrificed for a single meal. Rev. .1. K. Long, of Michigan, states that a pair of quails flew up out of his garden, and in making a turn about the corner of his li one of them missed its reckoning and, striking the wall, fell dead. On examining its distended crop, 101 potato bugs were found to have l&gt;een the little fellow's breakfast, for the bugs were yet alive and began to move about when brought to the fresh air. Let us repeat the question: "Can we afford 1 to kill our birds V One gentleman went so far as to say in my hearing that he was injured when his neighbors killed the birds on their own farms. And this does not seem so far wrong when we remem ber that many birds are rapid flyers and in a single days search for food, wander many miles from their nests. Much complaint is brought against the birds during the fru i. and w not deny that our little friends relish a juicy cherry ami appreciate a fruit diet as much as we. In view of this fact, we would advise the setting out of mulberry, cherry and e.ther trees whose fruit is known to be appreciated by the birds. these out instead of the long rows of maples and box elders for shade trees, with a view to the comfort of the birds, and leave the fruit on the trees especially to attract them to your homes. There is no extra cost to thiB; the ground is completely lost when given up to fruitless trees; and what can be more pleasing to the sight than the snowy banks of cherry blossoms, or the beauty of the red fruit hanging in the green foliage.

And then the music of the birds these trees will bring to your doors; the wild, rollicking cho - ruses they sing with their hearts bursting with gladness. &lt; &gt;h ! our debt to the birds! How can we ever pay it? What sound in childhood was ever so sweet to our ears? I would not forego even the owl's weird hooting in the distant woodland on a sum mei's nijjrht. And, who that ever heard it, can forget the whip poor-will's plaint; the wood thrush's piping at evening, or the pewee's mournful song? Who has not felt his pulses thrill to the love songs even of the blackbird? What sound is there in all nature to compare with the sad note of the Turtle Dove? What would our world be without this sweet bird music? You who would send forth your daughters to the high schools of training in harmonic sounds, go forth at morning and evening for just one hour to listen to this heaven trained orchestra. What sound, I say, is there in all harmony to compare with the clear ringing note of the Meadow Lark as it lifts its song to heaven, warbling forth a glad hymn of praise to the (liver of sunlight and morning? Then answer this honest question to your heart: "Could the masters of art, for any sum of money. train your children's voices to such pure, rapturous sounds?" What artist has ever blended upon canvas such tints as glow upon the Blue Mountain Lory, Evening Cross Beak, Scarlet Lauger, Golden Pheasant, or Purple (Jallinule? Even the Hum ming Bird or the Snow Owl, beggars human art to reproduce. Can we afford to wipe out forever from our sight these glinting, gleaming colors that skim and flash and dart before our won dering eyes? Shall I tell you of a cloak I once saw? It was an imperial garment belonging to the people of a heathen nation, for which one whole species of birds were killed, each little victim furnish ing only a single feather of a beautiful golden color which grew in its forehead. The garment is composed of millions of these feathers woven into a cloth which in its completion looks like shining yellow fur. imd has hitherto been worn by the rulers of </seg>

It is a Murage piece of royalty, or, shall I a royal piece of savagery? Yes; for mill ions of lives have bft-n sacrificed. But let it pass; they are a heathen people. Oh! what excuse can we offer when we must stand before the Author of all life to give an account of our stewardship over His creatures? Let the savage deck himself in bones of snakes; in claw bears; or even the scalps of men when the dried blood yet clings; but we! we have civilized and refined tastes, and recoil from such trophies. We delicate, shrinking women, who faint away at sight of blood, can d*eck ourselves in the dead bodies of birds; those innocent, defenceless creatures that can offer no re ance. Yes; we women are the ones who support a traffic which takes not only the creature's life (if the parent died alone that were bad enough), but the birds are of most value in their nesting Reason, as then their plumage is brightest. And for this beauty they must yield their lives, while their babies in the nest call in vain for food and the warmth of their mother's sheltering wings, till with hunger and the chill of the night dews, they die. Thus four lives are added to the charge by Him who "Bean the raven when it cries and marks the sparrow's fall." Four deaths, instead of one, for that pretty bird which nestles in the dainty laces on your bonnet. In the Australian woods, from whence many of our most beautiful birds come, the traders employ this method in their capture: First a single bird is caught, and after its eyes have been put out, it is placed in a tree the branches of which have been covered with a sticky gum used for that purpose. The trapper then returns to his home, well knowing that the little blind captive must stay there and die a slow death from hunger, while its plaintive cries make the forest resound with its grief. And though the human heart is stone against its call for mercy, yet the various birds of the woodland, hearing its cry, come to its aid, only to be caught on the gummed branches. And as one after another is stuck to the tree, they add their frightened screams to the piteous note of the captive they came to save; 12 </seg>

Then the trapper returns and secures his treasures, carrying them homo with him where they are skinnned alive, as the feathers take on a rough appearance if renunetl from the bird after death. A gash is cut in the skin along the throat and across the hi ■ then the quivering body is torn out by cruel hands and thrown down to die, while another, and another, by the hundreds, suf fer this awful death. And for what? Khali I say for Christian women? That "Hue" might "just look lovely with that Bet Gull sitting jauntily on one side of her toque. And did yon see Minnie the other evening in her new walking hat? T.hert'"s two Orioles perched right in the front. Oh! girls, it's too lovely for anything!" l,et me beg of you who are present today; you in whose hands these innocent lives are placed; to give one moment of sober thought before allowing a dead bird to ornament your headwear. "Oh, well,'" you say, "no need to be so serious; those I have on are only wings." IHd you know that many birds are useless aa ornaments excepting their wings? And so the trader just wrings off the wings from the bird and throws the live body down in the grass to die of its wounds, not even taking time to put it out of its suffering. And I am so glad to note that there is not a lady in this audience today whose hat is orna - mented with birds or bird wings. Prof Newton, of England, once said that the custom of wear - ing bird skins for ornamenting ladies' hats was a pernicious one, and would, if persisted in, cause the total extermination of many species from the earth. All the world over where the birds have a brilliant plumage, the same destructive war in he - lag waged with a result that can be imagined when we remem - ber that for many years the fashion has been universal, and that it was estimated that in one year twenty to thirty millions of bird skins Were imported to supply the English market alone; and from statistics carefully compiled it is stated that more than fifty millions of bird skins have been sold for ornamenting </seg>

Many of these were imported from other coun - tries, but some millions are our native birds, including the thrusheH. orioles, blackbirds, and many others. The little black In-ailed pull, once so plentiful along our coast, is now rarely seen, and it is doubtful whether this beautiful bird will stand the war waged against it. The white heron has been entirely exterminated in Florida, its chief breeding place in North Ainer ica, and it is the opinion of the Indian local authorities that nothing can save the beautiful birds of India from complete •lest ruction but a prohibitive tax upon the export of their skins and feathers. Such is the demand for the adornment of ladies' bonnets and dresses in Europe, Asia and America, that the time is ripeyfor this derisive remedy if India is not to lose her crop of rice by insects. In Bengal and Madras the harmless poddy bird, the oriole and the little sunbird, are being exterminated, and bird feathers closely parked are going away from Indian ports in ship loads. In onr own country, seagulls have been killed in such numbers from the Gulf of Mexico that scourges of fever have swept along the coast from Mexico to Central ft If rift, arising from the dead fish lying along the shore, daily washed in by the tide and left to decompose, upon which these birds used to feed. It has been stated that such is the craze for bird feathers that wires have been stretched along the south of Franc*' on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, where the birds of passage alight to rest after their long flight, and are instantly killed by currents of electricity kept playing over the wires for that purpose. As the trees have been cut away from the shore, the birds can have no choice but to alight on the wires. But I have one morsel left to tell yon to prove that the last spark of feeling has not yet died out of the human breast, and. that is: a law has been passed in the state of Massachusetts prohibiting the killing or sale of birds for millinery purposes. The law is so stringent that ene may even be prosecuted in whose possession a bird skin is found. I find we have a section </seg>
            <seg id="p181">180 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. on the statute boeks of Nebraska that might be interesting to know. It reads thus: "It shall be unlawful for any persons in the state of Nebraska to knowingly or intentionally kill, injure or harm, except on the lands owned by such person, any robins, larks, turtle doves, thrushes, blue birds, king birds, sparrows, wrens, jays, swallows, orioles, wood-peckers, yellowhammers, cuckoos, yellow birds, bobolinks, or other bird or birds of like nature that promote agriculture or horticulture by feeding on noxious worms and insects, or that are attractive in appearance, or cheerful in song. Any person violating any of these provis - ions shall be fined not less than three (|3.00) dollars nor more than ten ($10.00) dollars, for each bird killed, injured or harmed." Then let us guard with tender care Each bright, glad life that's given. And praise our Maker for their songs; Their hues, sweet type of heaven. Shall mortal man God's gift disdain? In death shall every song be hushed? Shall army-worms eat up our grain, And caterpillars carpet earth? No! let us rise in manhood's strength; Let women echo back the cry: "Protection to our birds!" From now We will not stand and see them die. We'll lift our voices and our arms, If such are ever needed. We have the statutes on our books. And we'll see that they are heeded. DISCUSSION. Gov. Purnas: I have been very much pleased with the lady's presentation of this subject of protecting the birds in connection with horticulture, and for one I wish to thank her for the val uable manner in which she has presented it. Years ago when I first commenced to experiment with horticulture in this state I was wonderfully vexed with the birds. I would shoot, and have them shot, in every way possible to get rid of them. Af- </seg>
            <seg id="p182">terwards as I increased in years and learned more, I conceived the idea of dividing the fruit with the birds, and of planting fruits for them to ripen at the time of some of our principal fruits. To protect the last orchard I planted I surrounded it with Russian Mulberry and Wild Cherry for the purpose of feed - ing the birds, with most excellent results. With the sparrow, of which she speaks, I have bad some ex - periete. I was one of half a dozen who first brought the Eng - lish Sparrow from the east and introduced it into Nebraska, and have had experience with it. I have this only to say of the English Sparrow: If I shall ever be forgiven for helping intro - duce it into Nebraska, I will never do bo again. He is a pug - nacious fellow, and drives off ten of these insect-devouring birds where he fills the place of one. He drives our song birds away; he drives our insect-eating birds away; I have not a good word for the English Sparrow; not a single word. .Mrs. Hall: I thank Governor Furnas for his kindly words in commendation of my remarks, yet he has upset it all by what he said in condemnation of my little friend, and I resent it. If he will permit me to read a little extract from the Government Re - port at Washington, I am sure he will not dispute that: "The argument that the help of the sparrow is not needed for the suppression of the canker-worm, becadse various effective devices exist for the protection of the fruit and shade trees, decidedly loses its value, when summer after summer we have seen these devices applied with care, and in spite of these the foliage was destroyed, except where the sparrows were present in sufficient numbers to check it. Prominence has always been given to the alleged fact that the sparrows drive off indigenous birds. According to my personal observation in Cambridge, and other suburbs of Boston, this is not true. • • • The argument that sparrows drive other birds out of the bird boxes is rather a funny one, when it will be remembered that all those bird boxes were placed only for the sparrow. I think every bird will fight for its home; nevertheless I observed sparrows driven out of the box which they had used the year before by swallows, which raised their young safely among a dozen boxes near by used by sparrows.

It occurred, 1 believe in Australia, a good many years ago — at least in one of the English colonies — that insects became exceedingly abundant. And the colonists there remembered the grackles (which is pretty nearly our big blackbird) in England, and they got it into their heads that these grackles would destroy the insects. So it was managed to get the grackles into the colony, and the people were happy, for the insects went. But after a while they forgot the service the grackles had done in destroying the insects, and the people began to say the grackles were a nuisance, and in time there was a clamor to kill the grackles. That clamor arose until they got a law permitting the killing of the birds, and placing a bounty on them. Tlie small boy was turned loose, and in winter the fellow with the gun bad nothing to do but shoot grackles. But as the grackles disappeared the insects began to gain; an&lt;l they gained, and gained, and gained, until finally the people began to wonder what had become of the grackles ; and they got -the grackles back again. It may be that we are in the period of the people who have forgotten what the little fighting bird has done for us. I don't like to have the little fellow get around the eaves of my house; I don't like to have him get around the south side of Nebraska Hall and carry out there great wads of straw and stuff, but all the same that little fellow is eating millions and millions of insects every year. We Americans have got to learn a few things from our own experience; and I presume we will go on until the sparrows are killed off, and then we will begin to wonder why the English Sparrow is gone.

            <seg id="p188">185 STRAWBERRIES. BY C. H. BARNARD, TABLE BOCK. We as horticulturists do not work entirely from philanthro motives, therefore we look for that branch of horticulture which in onr opinion will give the greatest reward for the amount of thought and labor bestowed upon it. In this line it seems to me that the strawberry, of all the fruits grown in our state, is the most neglected by the great mass of people, y&lt; responds most readily with a good return of pleasure and profit for a very small investment. Plants cost but a trinV and (hey need so little care that it seems to me that the strawberry ought to be a part of every farmer's garden the same as - and potatoes or any other vegetable or fruit. In the planting of a strawberry bed the first thing is to thor - oughly prepare the soil so as to have it fine and moist. This will insure a good growth of plants and lessen the cultivation after planting, as soil in good condition does not need the culti vation after planting that soil which has been poorly prepared does. To do this it is a good plan to prepare the ground in the fall so that winter frosts and snow may render the soil fine and moist. Bet as early as frost is out of the ground in the spring, thereby insuring the longest possible growing season for the plants. Strawberry plants should be set from eighteen inches to two feet apart in the row, and the rows about four feet apart, so that most of the cultivation may be done with a horse cul - tivator. The plants should be cultivated as long as weeds grow in them; in other words, they should be kept clean of wt The setting of the plants is the most essential part of the strawberry business, as careless planting means a poor stand of plants, and a poor stand means a short crop of berries at pick ing time. It may seem lik.e a simple thing to set a strawberry plant, yet, simple as it seems, there are a great many people who do not know how to set a plant correctly. The plant </seg>
            <seg id="p189">186 S NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. ■ should be set deep enough so that when the ground settles the crown of the plant will be level with the surface of the ground or slightly below it. One of the best tools for setting straw berry plants is a common spade. Mark the rows out with a common marker, then set the spade in the mark, pressing it forward, leaving a hole back of the spade in which to insert the plant. Care should be taken to see that the roots are placed in good shape 1 , remove the spade and firm the earth about the plant with one foot while you set the spade for the next plant. As the strawberry plant is very tender, and the roots quite sub feet to injury by sun and wind, use a pail partly full of water to carry your plants in so as not to expose them, and you are reasonably sure to get a good stand. Sometimes plants may be set in August after fruiting time, but as a rule our falls are so dry, especially the month of An gust, that plants die before they become established, and fail - ure is nearly always the result of fall planting. VARIETIES. The variety of plant is somewhat a matter of taste; whether you wish them for table or market, and how distant the market is. The soft, tender varieties may be grown for home or table use, while for shipping they are too soft. I might name some of the varieties which I have tested and consider worthy of planting. The first on the list for me is the Crescent; a good, strong grower, making plenty of plants, productive in bearing, firm in fruit (which makes it very desirable for shipping), the color being a light red and the size large, especially on the newly planted beds. The Warfield is another of the early berries that is first-class in all respects. These two varieties are &gt; pistillate plants and need a fertilizing variety planted with them. We use the Beder Wood for fertilizing these -two varieties, as it blossoms at the same time and is a very free bloomer, also a good berry for home or near-by market. It is too soft for long shipment, but desirable for the purposes named. In planting the varieties it </seg>
            <seg id="p190">187 is a good plan to alternate the rows with pistillate and stam - inate varieties, or alternate the beds, if not too large, as they will fertilize quite a distance. "Buttons," as we call them — the small, hard berries, deformed and not filled out, are mainly caused by the lack of fertilization. The Parker Earle is a very fine, large berry, but does not make plants freely, and the fruit is tender and often damaged by onr hot sun and wind. Bubach's No. 5 is also one of the strawberry monstrosities which may 5e grown in a small way as curiosities of what may be done by berries, but they do not produce enough to make it profitable. The stems are very short and the berries hard to keep clean of dirt from our heavy dashing rains. The Robinson is one of the best late berries, coming in after the Crescent. It is to my notion the best table berry of them all, yet, as I said before, varieties are largely a matter of taste. What is true of one is true of all of the very large berries that I have tried; none of them are as good, as productive, or as strong growers as the medium berries? In closing let me urge all of my horticultural friends, if you do not have now a good strawberry bed, plant one and then do not wait until the old bed is entirely dead, or unprofitable, but keep planting new beds from year to year so as to always have a supply of this delicious fruit on hand in season for yourself and a surplus for your more careless neighbors, who will al - ways pay you a good price for them. I recently had a conversation with Gov. Furnas in which he was telling me what he had done in the way of raising straw - berries on a small piece of ground. From one bed containing 810 square feet he picked 400 and some odd quarts of berries. I have been figuring a little on that, and I find that an acre of ground at the same rate would produce 20,000 quarts of berries; a little over (500 bushels. But someone will say, "That was a small patch." If you will put in a large patch and give it the same care you can do the same thing, though I simply cite this instance to show what may be done on a small piece of ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">DISCUSSION. The President: I should like to ask Gov. Furnas to tell the audience what variety of strawberry he fruited on that small piece of ground Gov. Fuknas: The Brandywine. Mr. Christy: I should like to ask Mr. Barnard if he has the Mb. Barnard: We did have but discontinued it. We found §was too tender a variety; in a dry season the sun would scald e leaves badly. The President: Will you rate the varieties you like beat? Mr. Barnard: From twenty years' experience I would bead the list with Crescent, and fertilize it with Beder Wood. The PVarfield is a close second to the Crescent. From eight or nine ears' trial of it I would place it and the Crescent very near ogether. The President: Is not the Beder Wood about the best early rfect-flowering berry? Mr. Barnard: It is a good berry, but soft. It ripens before it gets red. G. W. Alexander: I would like to ask if anyone in Neuiaha county is growing strawberries on a commercial scale? I un - derstand the Governor is only growing a few; not in a com mercial way, and it seems to me there is a great opening here for growing strawberries on a commercial scale. I believe the nty is lac-king in fruit growers of that kind. it. Firnas: I raise a great many berries by using the in termediate spaces between the fruit trees. We ship thousands of boxes every year to various parts of the state. I don't know just how many acres we have; I never reckon them in that way. Perhaps so far this year we have shipped 25,000 quarts. tMR. Alexander: What do you get a quart or a box? Gov. Furnas: This year about four and one-half cents; not much as usual. The prices of fruit have all decreased. I remember when I sold my first Moore's Early grapes and got </seg>
            <seg id="p192">189 BTRAWBERRIE8. f 1 a basket for 10-lb. basket. We think we are doing pretty well now is we get fifteen or eighteen cents a basket by the car-load. All these things hare deteriorated in price, Vhile I think the quality of the fruit has improved. Mr. Alexander: Speaking of strawberries, the new varieties, Wolverton and Tennessee Prolific, have given as good satisfac - tion as anything I have tested. They are nice home-trade ber - ries whenever it is damp so they won't do to ship; the Wolverton and Tennessee Prolific will give just as large berries until the last are gone as they do at the beginning of the season. I like these as commercial and home berries. I have tried the Cre« - ifiit, but it hasn't given as good satisfaction as these berries; they have nice, strong spikes, stand up well so they are not down in the mud and sand. I get more profit out of these vari - eties than any others I have cultivated. R. N. Day: Why is it that as soon as the foreign berries are exhausted — which we buy for six, seven and eight cents a box — and berries of our own growing come on the market, the pri&gt; advances so readily? Is it not that we are negligent in supply- ing our own demands? Gov. Furnas: I think so, to some extent. The earlier berries come in before we get ours ripened, but they are not so good as our own home-grown berries, and they generally come here in such condition that you and I would not use them. Ta one year with another I regard the strawberry as profitable as any other small fruit crop we can raise. Mr. Alexander : I should like to ask Mr. Barnard what he gets for strawberries? Mr. Barnard: I retail them at home at |1.50 per case, and figure that we make more clear money on strawberries tha any other crop we raise. H. F. McIntosh: I hope the society will pardon me for ing a few words about strawberries from the standpoint of consumer. I am satisfied that the berries we get from Mis» and Arkansas about the first of May are fully up to the </seg>
            <seg id="p193">190 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. braska standard of quality if we are willing to pay the price for good berries. We can get all varieties of quality; for instance, this year in Omaha there were many times when berries sol&lt; for from forty cents to |2.50 per case for 24-qt. cases. I bough three cases at one time for home use at fl.25 per case — jus about five cents per quart — and they were very good for can ning and domestic purposes. I think a large number of the &lt;•&lt;•&lt; nomical people of the cities supply themselves wit;h berries dur ing the cheap period of southern berries, so they will not con game as many home-grown berries at the prices they have t pay, say three boxes for a quarter, or two for a quarter, or even fifteen cents a box straight, retail, during the season of home - grown berries. I think so long as the home growers insist on these prices they will find the market limited, coming in as they do after the market has been glutted with foreign berries. The very best berries we get in Omaha are the Hood River, Oregon, berries, which are shipped a distance of 3,000 miles. Before they reach the market they have probably been picked a week, and yet they will stand up longer on the retail market after they are taken out of the refrigerator car than the home - grown berries after they are taken out of the garden. More than that, the Oregon berry has about 20 to 25 per cent larger domestic value per box than our home-grown berries, for the reason that it is a firmer berry, with thick, red juice, and goes further for canning or preserving, or even for eating with sugar and cream. So we prefer to pay fifteen cents a quart for the Oregon berries rather than twelve cents for the home-grown berries which come in at about the same time. But one thing that surprises me is this, and it is the point to which I wish to call attention: I have never been able to ascertain from anv of the horticulturists of Iowa or Nebraska what this variety of strawberry is that is grown in the flood River district. Why don't we wake up and grow the best berry on earth? &lt;5ov. Fcrnas: Perhaps that is the most valuable strawberry for Hood River, Oregon, yet if we should plant the same variety </seg>

I remember the cantaloupes I ate in California; they were the finest I had tasted, and I obtained some seeds from the fruit I had eaten and brought them home with me; but they didn't produce the same fruit here at all; not at all. So with those Hood River straw - berries; they have those peculiar characteristics of firmness, and the other characteristics of which you speak; yet I doubt very much if that Hood River strawberry were transferred to this climate whether it would produce as large and fine berries as are grown there. RAISING AND PACKING FRUIT FOR MARKET. BY MISS MAGGIE GILBERT, BROCK Raising fruit for market is a very profitable business, but I cannot say a pleasant task. As described by a lady from Lincoln at a farmers' institute, the picture would be as follows: "On an ideal summer morning, when the grass and foliage are covered with the gentle dew, fanned by the cool breeze, what a pleasant and healthful recreation it is to pick the luscious, ripe berries." Speaking of different tasks on the farm, including the above, she said: "If one knew how to do such things sys - tematically, such work would become mere pleasure." Let me describe the picture for you as it is in real life: On a sultry summer morning, after the heavy dew is thoroughly gone (for berries should never be picked when they are moist) to go between two high rows of bushes, where the "cool bn is barred out from you — though you can see where it is waving the topmost branches of the trees — with the sun above you pour - ing down a heat of 109°, carrying a carrier of six. eight, ten, twelve or sixteen empty boxes to be filled (and the farther you go the heavier the load), walking to the berry shed every so often and being reminded frequently that the branches have such a "clinging" nature; and when you have handled - </seg>
            <seg id="p195">■ - of grapes in one day, I know it is something besides mere "pleas ure and recreation." The fruit growers of Pottawattamie county, Iowa, have large fields of different fruits. They build sheds about midway in the fields where the berries are packed, covered, and made ready for market; where cases, boxes, and carriers are kept for the day's use. The pickers start from the shed with the carriers filled with empty boxes; these boxes are set together by the con - sumer, and that is done on rainy days and when the dew is on. Each picker has a ticket fastened on his or her person marked with the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8. Two pick a row; one on each side, and picking it thoroughly of those that are perfectly ripe ■ till it is finished, picking and keeping the soiled and unsalable berries separate. These carriers are shallow boxes with legs ■ and handles; they will hold four, six, eight, ten or sixteen boxes, and are made for convenience and to prevent handling the ber- ries again. They are filled and brought to the shed where the picker's ticket is punched with the number of quarts he has picked, before his carrier is removed from his hands. He does not need to wait for his carrier to be emptied and refilled with boxes, as there are carriers waiting. These filled boxes of berries are removed from the carriers and placed in the cases, which hold twenty-four quarts., hand- ling them carefully to prevent the berries from settling and mashing, and seeing that each box is filled a trifle oval and all stems and leaves removed. One or more persons stay in the Bshed while the picking is going on, and are kept busy punching tickets and packing and nailing cases. As soon as a case is filled it is nailed up to keep the dust out. I A bell is rung at a quarter before twelve for the picking to stop so that the berries can be cased and ready for market, for the morning berries go at noon and the afternoon berries at night. Those who belong to the Ffuit Growers* Association which </seg>
            <seg id="p196">193 193 RAISING AND PACKING FRUIT FOR MARKET. is organized in Council Bluffs, deliver their produce there and they dispose of it to all parts of the 1'nited States; while those .who do not belong to the association peddle their berries to the two cities. All berries are put in quart boxes except red and yellow rasp - jerries and mulberries, which are put in pint boxes, as they are so perishable. Strawberries and gooseberries are picked with the blossoms and stems on; I ■! I ■■!■ with the stems on. ind sold in the quart boxes; the stems are left on the cherries, and they are sold in X-lb. or 10-lb. baskets. Plums are picked &gt;ver and sold in X-lb. baskets, covered. Grapes require more ime and particular work than all. First the handles have to &gt;e put on the baskets, the covers stamped with the two different stamps — one for the grower's name and place, the other the association stamp. The baskets are taken to the vineyard and scattered along the rows. Sometimes large trays that will hold from forty to fifty pounds of grapes are used to pick in. There is a great demand for half-ripe grapes for jelly making, and then the entirely green grapes are picked off the bunches; but for later shipping only those bunches that are entirely ripe must be cut off, and never picked off, for picking them off leaves a ribbon on the bunch which mars the beauty of the grapes and also injures the vine by tearing the bark. Caution must be taken to prevent the bunches from falling, and to keep the filled baskets in the shade, as the sun soon blisters the grapes. The basket should be filled to weigh eight pounds or a trifle over as near as one can estimate. These baskets of grapes' are taken to a well-ventilated house and left to stand about twelve hours to allow them to wilt and settle so that the packing and covering will not crush them. The baskets are then made to weigh exactly eight pounds, when they are handed to the packers and all the grapes are taken out of the baskets and replaced, each bunch overlapping the stem of the other, leaving no decayed grapes or leaves and stems in sight. Now they are ready to be covered, which is done by fastening both 13 </seg>

A heavy canvas is fastened over each load of fruit to shield them from the dust and sun. The morning pick ing is packed at night, and the afternoon picking in the morn - ing. Cultivation of the different fruits is going on all the time except in the immediate neighborhood of the pickers, where t is stopped in order to keep the dirt off the fruit. Cleanliness and tastefulness should be observed in preparing fruit for market if a speedy sale is expected, whether for a large or small quantity. GRAPE CULTURE FOR PLEASURE AND PROFIT. BY G. W. ALEXANDER. There is no doubt but that the grape is a very desirable fruit to plant. It is one of the most ancient of fruits, and away back in the dim past the historian tells us about the culture of grapes and wine making. But in this practical age every .thing must be summed up in either pleasure or profit, hence the question "Will it pay?" has come to be the all-important one. Having spent several years of my life in grape culture in Nebraska, I studied how to obtain the greatest amount of money out of the business. Profitable grape growing is made up of many little details. The average grape grower is sure to meet with many disappointments, and very often the differ - ence between success and failure is a small matter. You can not know too much about the business. Grape culture" requires certain conditions, among which are proper soil and drainage, suitable varieties for the locality, proper planting and care after planting. I think in order to make a perfect success of grape culture, a man's knowledge must be something more than book knowledge. A person should have a natural love for the </seg>
            <seg id="p198">c w w\. a i rj t*\ t * t t \y jh^b t^^AwB^^mj k^b *»?* \y i KUr 1 1 * business; he should study the growing habits of the different varieties; note the time of ripening, productiveness, size of bunch and berry, color, also hardiness of vine. To be successful in grape culture, like any other business, requires diligent stidy and constant care. Twelve years of experience with about one hundred different varieties has taught me that in order to get a sure and large yield of fruit every year in our climate the vines of all varieties must be protected during our severe winters. The proper pruning of the vine is another essential point. Some prune too much and some do not prune enough. The proper pruning and training of the vine is a nice point to know, and can only be gained by actual experience. Too much cutting means a light crop; no pruning at all means a fair crop of poorly developed fruit, ripening several days later than it should. Most of the books on grape culture give some infor - mation on this subject of pruning, but it never can all be got out of books; it must be learned from actual experience in the vineyard. You cannot treat all varieties the same. Some re - quire long pruning, some short pruning, and others spur prun - ing. Always remember that a properly pruned vine will ripen fruit several days earlier than a neglected vine, and the earli - ness of fruit has a great deal to do with the value in the market. It is often said that anyone can grow fruit, but it takes a smart man to sell it well.* I found that nice, clean, well-devel - oped fruit put up in clean, new baskets holding about seven pounds of grapes, brought a fair price. But for fancy table varieties I prefer a 3-lb. package. Those little square baskets such as they use in California, or a 3-lb. Bradley butter box makes a good package. With the average customer fine looks has more to do with the sale than fine quality. The red and black grapes sell best in most markets. I would recommend the growing of the finer varieties of table grapes because I be - lieve it will pay best. About the only difference between grow - ing a good variety and a poor one is the first cost of the vines. </seg>

Do not be led to believe that the Concord is the only grape that is adapted to our climate; there are many varieties that will yield equ%l to the Concord, and if people would only plant the better varieties the Concord would soon have to take a back seat. Ninety miles west of this I have picked from a six-year-old Duchess vine, six 8-lb. baskets of as fine fruit as any on&lt;* could wish. I consider the Duchess grape a very desirable one for market or family use, because it has fine keeping qualities. 1 have had it on exhibition in fine condition at the State Horticul - tural Society's meeting in January. For all the Duchess is a white grape, it handles well and sells well. But I am told that the Duchess does not do well in Nemaha county, while it did splendidly in Saline county. 1 would recommend the following varieties for table use or fancy market: Brighton, Woodruff, Goethe, Agawam, and Jef - ferson. Brighton and Agawam'should be planted among other varieties as they are not good self-fertilizers. For black grapes I would recommend Worden, Herbert, Wilder, Early Victor, and Telegraph. The Telegraph and Early Victor are fine early grapes, ripening as early as Moore's Early. I would include i this list of black grapes the Moore's Early, although it has a ways been a very shy bearer with me. I am told that it does much better here than further west. For white grapes I woul&lt; plant the Duchess and Diamond. Vifles of all of these varietie can be procured at a nominal price. But before planting I would consult with the most experi - enced grape-men of the neighborhood, for after testing about one hundred varieties I only found about thirty or forty that were worth cultivating. It is not to be supposed that out of the six or seven hundred varieties of American grapes that they would all be adapted to this locality, although I believe the conditions in this part of the state are highly favorable to sue cessful grape culture. I would not advise the planting of more than eight or ten varieties. There is a vast territory west and </seg>

With a fair set of brains and a little common sense, with proper vari - t'ticH and suitable location, well pruned and good care, any man or woman can make a success of grape culture. DISCUSSION. tAfn. YorN&lt;;ERs: Isn't it a fact, Mr. Alexander, that if you -re planting ten acres of grapes yon would plant about nine res of them Concord? Mh. Ai.exanhkk: No, sir; I wouldn't plant a single Concord. Gov. Furnas: Nor I either. Mr. Youngehs: We find that the Concord at two and one-half or three cents a pound will net us more money than any red or white grapes we can grow. The great mass of people prefer a black grape to any of the white or red ones. Gov. Fcrnas: Horace Greeley said: "The Concord is the grape for the million." I guess that is so; and for that reason I don't plant it. Out of 25,000 grapes I have not a single Con - cord. I put Moore's Early in its place. The Niagara is a grape which I think there is nothing can beat as to quality. It yields well, is a fine looking grape, though most grape growers put it on the market before it is ripe. It should be a nice amber color. Mr. Barnard: I want to say a word about the Duchess. I don't want this record to go out in its present shape. The Duchess grape is not worth one cent. I wouldn't give a man room on my place to plant it, because it sunscalds; the foliage is very tender. Our brother here was speaking about laying vines down in winter. I want to say that I have been all my life in a vineyard and orchard, and I never buried a grape vine yet. I have some thirty varieties, and with the exception of one or two they came through this past winter all right. But the Duchess has never done any good. I have tried it several times in order to give it a fair test, and while it winters fairly well, when the hot suns of summer come the leaves sunscald. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">and leave a few little, scrawny bunches hanging on the vines which the sun cooks before they are ripe. I am like Mr. Young ere; I have never been able to make a success of the white grapes. Mr. Alexander: I don't intend to defend the Duchess grape, the good qualities of it, or the success of it in all parts of the ■fate of Nebraska, but I shall have to defend my former state - ment. I think there are gentlemen in this room who saw the Duchess exhibited by myself at Lincoln a great many times, and they will surely say it was successful with me. Mb. Youngebs: I have seen the Duchess exhibited by Mr. Alexander at Lincoln, and they were very tine. I have the Duchess at Geneva, however, and it is not a success there. I have thirty-four varieties, and I make more money out of the Concord than any other variety I have. The President: I wish to make a statement while it is on my mind. In our vineyard last year from 700 Concord vines we picked 3,500 baskets of grapes and sold them at thirty-five cents a basket. I have not found any other vineyard in the state of Nebraska that has made that much money. KI'RAYING KV PETER VOUXGER8, GENEVA This is a very broad subject, and one upon which so many articles have been written and so many experiments conducted that it would seem as though we ought to have at hand infor - mation enough to enable us to successfully cope with the insect and fungus pests that annoy the horticulturist. Yet many things happen to prevent the successful application of the mix - tures at the right time, and often just as we finish spraying a heavy rain will render useless all our labor, thus making it nec - essary to immediately go over the same ground again. Then, </seg>
            <seg id="p202">too, we have sometimes had occasion to question the purity of the Paris green or London purple used. But while we have met # with many disappointments, we have also had good success in many ways. Taken altogether we believe in spraying. We have used the spray pump for codling moth, tent caterpillar, and fungus. This season it will require almost 500 pounds of sulphate of copper for the work we have undertaken. We commenced spraying this season on May 18; have now sprayed the entire orchard three times (a portion of it fonr times) and expect to give it another spraying. We find on ex - amination that in that portion of the orchard where Bordeaux mixture was used in connection with the London purple last year the trees wintered better and are in better condition than trees that were sprayed with London purple alone; the foliage and general appearance of the trees were much improved. I believe that if an orchard is sprayed four times during the sea - son, the first and last sprayings should be with Bordeaux and Paris green mixed. By following this method I believe that we can not only drive the insects out of the orchards, but the fungus and scab as well. I have seen cherry trees that were almost entirely stripped of their leaves by mildew. In one orchard near Topeka, Kan - sas, qnite a portion of the trees were entirely winterkilled where the mildew had affected the trees last season. The pre- matnre loss of the leaves left the vitality of the trees so low # that the severe winter killed them. The trees were about five inches in diameter and had been bearing for a number of years. I believe that with two or three applications of Bordeaux at the proper time last year, the trees would have been bearing thi« season. We have been spraying the nursery trees as well as the orchard, having sprayed the young apple, cherry, plum and pear stocks, buds and grafts four times this season. It is our pur - pose to destroy the insects on the trees, hold the fungus in check, and retain the leaves in as healthy condition as possible </seg>
            <seg id="p203">200 NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. until their proper time for falling. We believe that in thi8 way the life and vigor of the tree are sustained so that it is in much better condition for future growth. For nursery trees we use 12 lbs. sulphate of copper, 8 lbs. quicklime, and \ lb. Paris preen to each kerosene barrel of wa - ter. For orchard trees we use just half as much of the copper and lime, thus making the Bordeaux mixture only half strength. The abOTe is twice as much Paris green as is ordinarily used, but we find no bad effects from using this amount in connection with the Bordeaux mixture, as the lime prevents the poison from burning the foliage. In spraying with Paris green alone we only use \ lb. to each barrel of water. In dissolving the sul - phate of copper better results are obtained by putting it into a sack and suspending it in a barrel of water, than by simply pour - ing it into the water. It dissolves faster when suspended in u sack. As to results, up to the present time we have a good, strong growth in the nursery and are free from insects. The orchard j has a smaller per cent of wormy apples than ever before at this season of the year, but we intend to keep on spraying for a while longer to make sure of results. IX) FLOWERS PAY? BY L. C. CHAPIN, LINCOLN. The question of today is 'Does it Pay?" Your neighbo builds a fine house; does it pay? You buy some blooded stock does it pay? Or you buy another farm; does it pay? You hear the question asked of nearly every transaction of today. So very properly we should ask, Do flowers pay? I think they do and will try to show you why. Twenty five years ago many of us in Nebraska could not have had them even if they did pay; but all that has changed and it is now time for us to have. </seg>
            <seg id="p204">201 some of the pleasant things of this life, and at the mm time the paying ones. You will all admit that advertising pays. Well, there are different kinds of advertising. Buy a farm upon some well traveled road; let the fences fall down, shingles blow off the house, leave the farm implements in the roadside among the weeds — you are advertising, and soon i HI jot who drives along that road will know your name, where you cane from and where you are going to irind up: and, strange to tell, your credit will not be good at the bank. Change this. Build up the fences; clean tip the yard and set apart even a small place for lawn; plant a few flowers, shrubs, trees, etc. You know how it goes. Soon you will paint the house and tidy up the place, and make that home the prettiest one on that street. Everyone who passes will know your name, where you came from, that you are not going to wind up at all, and, what is not strange, your credit will be good at the bank. And now for a bit of nature. Does a squealing pig pay? N'o, because he is not contented. Does a lowing cow pay? No; same reason. Does a discontented farmer or fanner's wife pay? No; same reason. Do discontented farm boys and farm help pay? You know they do not. Now you can cure all that, and one of the ways is to plant a few flowers, shrubs, etc, and fix up even a small lawn; keep grass and weeds mowed and make it a sight good for tired eyes. Then your wife, as she looks at the pretty yard, will say to herself, "I have a pretty home." and will turn to her work with renewed strength and a contented smile. And as you come home from your day's work you will glance at the neat lawn and fragrant flowers, and I guarantee you will do more work and do it better. Your help will feel an interest in the place, and will of their own accord do as their employer does. If he takes an interest in keeping everything neat and tidy, they will do the same. Plant flowers, and soon you will plant the fruit; the two go </seg>

And now that Nebraska has been proven the purden spot of the earth, it is time for us to wake up and Mcfc one set his neighbor a good example by planting flowers, shrubs, and fruit. Let us begin to live; for indeed it is only the pleas ant things, such as these, that we get out of life as we go along that makes it worth living. So I say, plant flowers. Plant the kinds you like, no matter what that kind may be. Take care of them; and when asked the question, "Do flowers pay?" even the oats, wheat, and corn will nod their heads and answer "yes"' on account of the better care they have had. You yourself will reply, "Yes; they pay not alone in dollars and cents, but in life's happiness." FLOWERS. BY MISS EDNA NAYLOH, JOHNSON. The committee gave me the very expansive subject of "Flow - ers," but I have attempted to prescribe limits by lengthening the text, so will give a few thoughts suggested by the following: "The Evolution of the Average Flower Grower." Yes; the growth and development of the flower grower, for he, too, grows as well as his plants. Indeed, their growth is dependent upon his development, and serves as a measure of his progress. The average flower grower makes his first attempt at flower growing with little or no knowledge of the subject, and as we contemplate his crude efforts a wave of sympathy sweeps over ■ OS, for we too have traveled the same rough road and have not yet reached smooth ground. Possessed with a degree of love for the beautiful, or perhaps with a desire to rival a successful neighbor, the novice sallies forth in spring determined to have a flower garden; secures a </seg>
            <seg id="p206">quantity of seeds, bulbs, and plants, and proceeds to plant with - out regard to soil, location, or adaptability. Perhaps the ground was worked when too wet and became hard and lifeless; the weather grows warm and weeds flourish spontaneously; the plants are crowded and weak; and when the scorching heat of mid-gammer arrives, all hope of blossoms perishes with the plants. If a desire to equal a neighbor was the source of the effort, it will probably be the last, and the verdict will be: "I can't raise flowers; I never have any luck with them." Bat if a real h&gt;ve for flowers was the moving force, a determination to con - quer grows out of the defeat. All available articles on floricul - ture are carefully read; catalogues studied; friends consulted; and by the return of spring many of the mistakes of the past season have been located, and much information gained. This time the beds are given more careful preparation; the soil is spaded deeply and well pulverized; if necessary a little sand and some rich soil from the barnyard are added ; the plants are given room to develop, and space allowed to permit cultiva - tion. Copious showers now descend and the novice at last sur - veys a wealth of bud and blossom; success seems assured. But alas! "things are not what they seem." August is not June; Mother Nature refuses to supply rain; the plants begin to droop; their owner rushes for the watering pot, pours on the water liberally but vigorously, and then wonders why the ground becomes so dry and the plants are so ungrateful as to fail to respond to such devoted care. So precious are the blos - soms that picking is not to be thought of, and they are allowed to wither on the stalk, and the vitality of the plants is so ex - hausted in ripening the seed that they fail to recuperate when the cool rains of autumn finally arrive. But the gleam of success acts as a stimulus and strengthens the determination to grow flowers. A good flower magazine is now subscribed for, not to fill the paper rack or adorn the li - brary table, but to be diligently read and filed away for future </seg>

More care is given to the requirements of each indi - vidual plant, and preparations are made to counteract the Hum - mer drouth. The surface of the soil is stirred as soon as possi Me after every rain to prevent the escape of moisture, and this stirring is repeated every three or four days during a protracted drouth. If it is desired to apply water by artificial means, — unl&lt;*s an abundance is at hand and apparatus available for imi - tating nature's plan for applying it, — the simple method is it - sorted to of sinking several flowerpots among the plants and filling them with water, which slowly sinks away through the holes in the bottom or sides of the pots and reaches the root! where it is needed without hardening the surface soil. Nature's n in generosity has also been learned, namely, that picking the blossoms from most classes of plants only brings them in greater abundance and extends the blooming season, and while gathered ample bouquets, the plants are pruned and kept in shapely form. Only a few of the most perfect blossoms are allowed to ripen seed. Within doors the window garden keeps pace in improvement with that without. The first attempt results in a shelf full of dusty, nickly plants, poorly drained, usually wet and sodden, but sometimes famished for water and the soil dry and hard. "Oh." says the owner, "if I could just have some 'green things a growin' ' during the dreary days of winter I should not mind about the blossoms." But when that success is attained the standard of excellence is raised and blossoms are eagerly striven after. The novice may now be called an amateur floriculturist, hav - ing a growing comprehension of nature and her wants. A re - lationship is established between them which is never broken, but grows stronger with each succeeding year. The arrangement of the plants, that they may really be an em bellishment to the home, now absorbs the attention, and there dawns a conception of the whole — the buildings, the trees, the flowers, the immediate surroundings, all containing to make </seg>

From this enlarged view there cannot but grow yet broader ideas; he concurs in the idea that a beautiful country makes patriotic citizens (the masculine pronoun is ion tinually used only because of the poverty of our language), and widens his interests to include the improvement of roadways, streets, and all public grounds, and lends aid and encourage ment to all efforts to disseminate practical knowledge along this line. Perhaps some' of my hearers may say the change is too great; that it is too much to ascribe such progress and at - tainments to the (irmiye flower grower. Well, possibly it is at the present time; if so, just reserve the description for the mediocre of the early years of the coming century — sa&gt; years hence — and it may even then fall below the truth. I predict, and trust to the optimism of the prophecy to gain pardon for assuming the role of prophet, that the process of development from novice to successful floriculturist and pro - moter of out door art will in the near future become more rapid and pronounced. The efforts of the fast-multiplying improve ment associations, with their various names but united purpose, and the enthusiasm of the public school teacher in introducing nature study, must, result in a spread of both knowledge and zeal, and this always beautiful land of ours shall become yet more beautiful. KEEPINC. THE CHILDREN ON THE FARM. BY MISS HATTIE MILLBR, JOHNSON. It seems as if the above subject assigned by the program i mittee should have been given to^some one who has had ex - perience in keeping children on the farm, but perhaps the mem - bers looked at another phase of experience, as your humble servant has sjM'iit her life in the country. We shall endeavor * </seg>
            <seg id="p209">206 NEBRASKA 8TATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. to give a few thoughts from observations made, bat we feel as if we can give but little to interest older minds than ours. The subject of child study should be thoroughly investigated by parents on the farm. The old saying, "Children are little men and women," is quite true. In their plays, children often manifest what vocations will be a pleasure to them when they hrrmr grown men and women. Their natural tastes and desires shonhl be cultivated as much as the parents are able. Of course it is understood that these natural tendencies should be cultivated in such a way that will lead to noble lives and useful occupations. We believe any child who has attained to the age of sixteen years should have some idea of what his life-work will be. If child study were more carefully investigated, many of the teachers who merely Btay in the schoolroom, some of the physi - cians, lawyers, and ministers, in fact some in every trade and profession, would be on the farm. On the other hand, more of the farm boys and girls would find their way to occupations in harmony with their natural talents. If Mr. A. is a farmer, it should not follow that all of his sons should be farmers, any more than all the sons of the merchant should follow the mercantile business, the sons of a doctor ad - minister pills and quinine, or the children of a chancellor of a great university be authority in educational centers. This would be a step toward taking up the custom of castes as exists today in India and a few other countries of the Orient. We should not insist upon keeping all the boys and the girls on the farm. The foundry, the blacksmith shop, the machine shop, the store, the schoolroom, the senate, the bar, the press, the president's chair, and the pulpit need our boys or girls with their sound bodies made so by the physical exercise and the boundless pure air they have obtained in their simple country life. The city with its vice would in years become almost de - populated were it not for the new life and strength the young people from the farm take into it. # </seg>
            <seg id="p210">• 207 KEEPING THE CHILDREN ON THB FARM. What would onr nation have been if Lincoln and scores upon scores of other stars, that shine out so brightly in the annals of our country, had stayed on the farm simply because they were born there? Our great ship of state has never been more safely guided than when some of o,ur nation's sons from the farm have been at the helm. We do not wish to be misunderstood with regard to our boys and girls going into vocations that will cause them to drift into he city. Our theory is, keep the children on the farm if posei - &gt;le, but if their natural talents lead toward some other voea - ion do not put a stumblingblock in their way. iln selecting a vocation for life, the farm boy or girl should t take up the first one that suggests itself. They should not ink, "Oh, just anything but farm life." One thing to be de - rmined first is, Will it give me a subsistence? If it cannot, it ould be rejected. Other questions to be answered are: Does have attractions, is it agreeable, is it a work that will elevate ose with whom I associate as well as myself? Hew many peo - b have chosen a life-work that has a subsistence but no pleas - e in it, thereby living unhappy lives, and even causing the rrounding atmosphere to be full of dissatisfaction. It is often the parents' fault that many of the children leave the farm. If one child should seem exceedingly bright, he must have the best education. He must be fitted for a profession. The boy who seems the dullest of the family, because,- perhaps, his mental faculties are a little slower developing, receives a scant education. Why? "Oh, he is going to be nothing but a farmer, anyway." The wishes of either one are not consulted. Why not give each of the boys a course at the agricultural col - lege? It is a great mistake to send the brightest children to the city. No other occupation requires such a vast scope of knowl - edge as agriculture and the division- horticulture. kWhat a blessing it is that we as a peoj&gt;le are beginning to ?1 that agriculture and horticulture are intellectual as well as mual pursuits. Some of the trades and professions require </seg>
            <seg id="p211">208 work mostly with the intellect, while others require more with the hands than with the intellect. The true farmer unites both the manual and intellectual and becomes the well-developed being his Creator intended he should be. The impression should not be made 1 upon the mind of a child who is nearly grows that farm life is more narrow than life in the city, for it is not. Horticulture girea it a still broader phase. All rscea and classes, excepting the inhabitants of extremely cold countries, have always depended so largely upon horticul - tural and agricultural products, that it is of common interest to have a knowledge of them. The flower and vegetable, the gar - den, the orchard, the field have always been the most liberal contributors to the welfare and pleasure of the human family. The horticultural and agricultural domains present the greatest laboratories known. Nature's stored up riches in these wait to yield more of her valuable treasures, not alone to supply mate - rial for food, raiment, and shelter, but food for the intellect as well. Everything appears as being useful or not useful. On the farm, the work means the necessities of life, a comfortable home. Mr. Harris, 1*. S. Commissioner of Education, says, "Fortunate are those children whose early years are spent in the country, in close contact with the boundless riches it bestows." The surroundings of the country children are so much differ - ent from those of their city cousins. The flowers, the trees, the leaves, the lields, and the landscape in general make such dis - tinct images in the child's mind, that stream through every av - enue of the soul. The same colors, sounds, and forms, though presented in endless succession, give numberless varieties in beautiful harmony. Children, naturally, are lovers of the beauties of nature, but their progress in the knowledge of these beauties is often thwarted on account of the parents' or the teachers' ignorance of them. If nature study w r ere practiced more in the home cir - cle, that the children might hear something besides corn and hogs, the boys and girls would not have such a dislike for the farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p212">209 The horticultural division of agriculture should be pract lore. Horticulture in our language has a broader meaning than he old Latin noun, hortus, from which the first part of the word s derived. It takes in all that pertains to vegetable and orna - nental gardening, fruits of all kinds, floriculture, and for« Vhat we need in keeping children on the farm is to have them htain broader views of horticulture and agriculture. What little child is not interested in the growth of seeds, and, as we have stated before, the beauties of nature? Enlarge the •hild's mind along this line, step bv step. There is an old truth. Our natural characteristics are developed only through the •&lt;eiises bv contact with those natural things around us." The work of the farm and garden is not degrading, neither is it a slave's work. Parents on the farm or anywhere else make a great mistake when they utter such statements before their children. There are some farmers, yes, many of them, who make their lives almost slaves to the farm by wanting to get half of the land surface of the earth. It is a slave's life only when greed takes the place of common sense. Children should be taught life on the farm is the most inde - pendent life in the whole wide world. Every one else has to de - pend upon the farmer. He does not have to respond to the call of the bell nor the blow of the whistle. Every vocation has some unpleasantness, "tone bitter with the sweet," and its own pecu - liar routine. But teach the child in the country, yes, everywhere, that the farm has less of these than any other occupation has. This bit of poetry, taken from the Farm Journal, might be instilled into their minds with good effect: . •Better to delve all -day, With the blessing of peace at night. Than to fritter the time away With fingers idle and white. For labor is God's good gift, Though it be a curse of the fall. And the hands that struggle and lift Are the noblest hands of all." 14 </seg>
            <seg id="p213">K Agriculture and horticulture were man's first occupations ac - rding to the Bible. So have they been first in importance Bnce, and always will be. If these were honored by our all-wise reator, why should we dishonor them, and urge our children to dishonor them? I say our children, for I consider my influ - next to the parents'. In my course of humhle instruction 1 tell my pupils there is no nobler occupation than that of agri- Bulture, and many times have I told my boys to stay on the farm nless they were sure they could better themselves. The farm child must have a pleasant home, not necessarily a luxuriant one, by any means, to keep him there. He must not be made to think that all he is fit for is to work. The improve - ments on the farm should not consist merely of a house to shelter the family, and barns and sheds for the stock, but the yard and garden should have many shade and ornamental trees and flow en». Plenty of fruit should be provided. If the homes were made more attractive both inside and outside more children would want to stay on the farm. Every farm home should be supplied with good horticultural and agricultural papers. The children should be encouraged to read these as soon as they are ©Id enough to comprehend the contents. We must not merely be pleasant with the children, but amuse - ments and entertainment must be furnished them. If they do not find these at home they will find them in the neighboring village. Good books and music should find their way into every farm home. Nothing adds to the beauty of a pleasant home more than music, either vocal or instrumental. Great care should be taken in the choice of literature, even for the children. It is in the spring time of life when good seeds are sown for high grade reading. A person becomes like that which he admires. People often pattern after their favorite characters in a story and become like them almost as much as if they could associate with them in person.

Such lit - erature is sure to make our boyi become unsettled and dissatis - fied with the farm. There should be some books and a good magazine on birds, for certainly there is no greater friend to the farmer and the horticulturist than our feathered friends. Let the boys become interested in them by making houses and convenient drinking places for them, and the girls by feeding them when it is cold. It seems as if horticulture offers as many, if not more attrac - tions, than any other occupation. No fanner should be an ex - clusive agriculturist. He should mix in horticulture. It makes the dearest of all places, home, more pleasant. There is another pleasure, one can always see the fruits of his labor. It is not only an attractive and money-making occupation, but it require* thought and study. Fruits combine beauty and palatableness. In the long list of edibles there is no article so well liked or healthful as fruit. Children may become interested in the farm or garden by be - ing skillfully trained in the care of fruit and vegetables, so as many luxuries may find the way to their tables as grace the board of any in the cities. We say better luxuries, because oar city friends do not know how long the fruit has been picked, unless it is the few who have their own orchards, bushes, and vines. But the farmer may have it fresh every meal and between meals if wanted. Children will take a greater interest if a small part of the proceeds goes to them. If they are allowed to have money of their own, the work will not seem such a drudgery to them. Along with the money should be taught a correct economical usage of it. Let the children care for a setting hen, claim the brood and the money, too, that they bring. As they grow older a calf, a lamb, a pig or a cow might be given them. Let them feel as if they had something of their own, and not wait until they are twenty-one years of age before they possess a single iota. </seg>
            <seg id="p215">212 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. There are so many ways on the farm to interest the children. What little six year-old does not like his own little garden, and is elated beyond description when presented with a set of tools, such as a little rake, hoe and spade? His little flower-beds will then be a source of pleasure to him, as will also a little peanut patch. As they grow older have them bud some fruit trees, re - serving a few for their own. It is a pleasant and instructive occupation. Children, as a rule, like to work, and nowhere on this beautiful earth are such educational advantages offered to train children to love their work as in a good country home. The best graded school in Boston can never equal in educative value the education on a farm if conducted with intelligence. This training makes the child put his brain to work in such a way that will make him feel responsible for something. Out of this responsibility grow habits of industry, trustworthiness, and a feeling of personal power. These alone are qualities which go to make up the necessary elements of character, except the phases of character which arise from contact with society ex - ternal to the home. This coming in contact with elements outside the good moral, spiritual home is one reason why we should keep the children on the farm as long as possible, for it is conceded by all, there are more vices thrown around them in the city. So many parents who live in the country are not informed with regard to these matters, and therefore do not realize the temptations set before their children. Many of our farm bojs and girls desire places in town, because they think the work is more honorable. Many girls get this idea and often envy the position of girls who are apparently enjoying life. Their being in the midst of gaiety and animation does not reveal the fact that at the same time they are suffering from want of things which keep soul and body together. There are few who see the , well-dressed girls behind the counters of the large department stores of our cities who realize the starvation wages received.

What has she left to finish providing her temporal wants? Such wages mean a life of poverty or a life of shame. The farm home, however attractive, will not always send out its inmates to be farmers. If they choose some other occupa - tion, have them go from the farm with the opinion that agrical - ture is a noble and worthy occupation. Furthermore, the only reason they leave is because they know they will be of more benefit to themselves and their fellow-beings, and beli&gt; have chosen a work that will develop as many of nature's talents with which God has blessed them as is possible. RASPBERRIES. HY C. ('. MARSHALL, ARLINGTON. Mr. PrmUkmt: I haven't prepared any paper, and don't know that I can say anything that will interest you, but will do the best I can. It seems to me from my observation that the rasp - berry has not received the attention that it deserves. If you ask anyone about grapes, or plums, or anything of that sort that we find growing wild in our state, they will tell you, "Ye«; we can grow them; we have them growing wild here." But if you inquire about the raspberry you will find very few who have tried it to any extent, and those who have attempted to g them have generally failed. Still we have them growing wild in nearly every county in the North Platte country. We find them growing even as far north as Sheridan, Dawes, and Butte counties. Wherever there is timber, and in the galchfli and canyons you will find raspberries growing wild. I think raspberry culture in Nebraska is in its infancy. A great many people in using the raspberry use it as a luxury, not as a necessity. I think- the people should be encouraged to plant more raspberries, and I also think they can be educated </seg>
            <seg id="p217">to buy more of the fruit. In our home village of about 800 in - habitants, when we first commerced to sell raspberries two or three cases would overstock the market. Today it is nothing uncommon to sell ten, fifteen, or even twenty oases in one day in that little town, simply because the people have become ac - customed to buying them. When raspberry season comes every body is wanting raspberries. Our mode of planting and growing raspberries is very simple. We started in ten or twelve years ago on a very small scale. and what we have now are growing in young orchards; we have none planted by themselves. We aim to plant about seven feet apart, or make the distance .is near that as we can by planting in the rows between the fruit trees. The varieties which do best for us are some of those recommended in the paper just read. The Nemaha does well; the Palmer is our best early berry. The Gregg is a very good berry; it is a good keeper and a good shipper. The Older is a splendid berry for the home market, but a poor shipper. Mr. Day: Do you raise the Kan Ma. Marshall: This season is the second year we have fruited that berry; this being a dry year it did very nicely. One thing about the Kansas is it comes and goes quick; you doa'1 have to go over the patch very often. The Palmer is much the same in that respect. In the matter of cooling we consider good aeration of mqre importance than anything else. Some six or seven years ago we got a refrigerator that would hold twelve or fourteen i of berries. The ice was right under the berries and if our bar - ries were not soft of course we could keep them in there for sev - eral days, retailing them right out of the ice-box. But if we took them out to ship they would not stand up at all; they went right down. This year we practiced taking the wagon right into the field and carrying the berries to the wagon as fast as they were picked. As soon as a few cases were filled they wen - taken to a shed where there was shade, the sides being open so as to give a good circulation of air, and we never had as good </seg>

They could be picked one morning and hauled to Fremont the next morn which is ten miles from our place, and arrive in good condii The town of Fremont will consume a good many more l&gt;ei than are being raised within ten miles of it. Mr. Hess: How do yon rate raspberries for profit? Mit. Marshall: There is more profit in raspberries for us thin year than in any other crop we have. Of coarse the black berries are light. Mr. Hess: Take it on an average for ten years. Mil. Marshall: I think they are more profitable than any oilier fruit we raise. 1 Miring the ten years* we have been frui' raspberries we haven't had a total failure. We have had several partial failures, while this year acre. they paid us about |125 per Qikstion: How much a crate? The first few years we raised always found the market Mh.

We get most of our pickers from the country, the vil - lage being small. Most of them pick for berries and we have ihem take their berries on Saturday and in that way we do not have any berries to put on the market Saturday. Qtomtiok: You said that raspberries ought to be considered a necessity; why do you think so? Mh. Marshall: We frequently hear it said that a man isn't prepared for winter unless he has a good supply of apples in cellar. If we had berries so that people would get an idea of their real value they would become accustomed to putting them up and they would be regarded as much a necessity as any other fruit. 1 M. Ul l&gt; Mk. Yager: I would like to ask Mr. Marshall what he thinks about the relative value of raspberries and blackberries for « Mr Mr Mh.

Our bushes were very large this year, but we knew this spring that they were hurt with the winter somewhat while the raspberries were not hurt very much. Even after some of them had set fruit the stalk died and didn't mature the fruit, which makes them very ■potted. In places we will get into a row where we will find lots of ber - ries; then we will find a space where there are none at all. Mr. Bombergeu: What experience have you had with red raspberries? Mr: Marshall: We have paid very little attention to red raspberries. What little experience we have had with them lias not been profitable. Mr. Dunlai-: What varieties of the reds have you tried? Mr. Marshall: The Turner and Cuthbert. Mr. Ddmup: Which of those two do you find most profitable? Mr. Marshall: 1 think the Turner. Question: Have you tested the London? Mr. Marshall: No sir. Mr. Whitford: Have you ever found any profit in the Cuth aert? Mr. Marshall: No sir. Mr. Titus: The Loudon is no hardier than any of the other red varieties. Qctktion: Have you any of the yellow raspberries? Mr. Marshall: We have one. It is a seedling, is perfectly hardy, and has fruited every year for the last six years, but the quality is poor and it is not a profitable berry. It is too small. Mr. Rich: I Would like to hear Mr. Wallace tell us something about his new raspberry. Mr. Wallace: I guess the best way is just to taste it. (Mr. Wallace then passed around a box of the berries and gave the following description of the Wallace raspberry): "A new seedling hybrid, seven years trial, vine vigorous. nearly thornless, a fine tipper, sufficiently hardy, a good bearer, season longer in bearing than blackcaps: ripening a little later </seg>
            <seg id="p220">217 RASPBEK! than the Gregg, fruit quite tart but rather rich in quality; size medium to large; inclined to be laxative, we think, instead of costive as the blackcaps are; fruit is some softer than the black caps, not quite so good a shipper; better for home market, best for family use.". Oapt. Irm: I will say that I hare givm considerable atten - tion to the matter of testing different varieties of raspberries. For a numjt&gt;er of years I have had charge of one of the experi - ment stations of the State Horticultural Society of Iowa, where we are testing all kinds of fruit. Especially during the last two or three jean I have given particular attention to experiments with raspberries, having on my own grounds perhaps twenty different kinds. I will say that yesterday I had the curiosii call at Mr. Wallace's place and examine his plants carefully. He has about an acre and a half planted to the Wallace rasp - berry. About one half of the patch is large fine plants and have produced fruit on the last year's wood; the other half of the patch was planted last spring, and I must say I have a more favorable opinion of that raspberry than any other I h;ivr set'ii. The bushes seem to be very healthy, dean and nice; they stand up well, are tippers, do not sprout from the root, and the most remarkable thing I saw about those berries was that there was a good crop on the last year's canes, and a fair crop on the canes produced this season. I cut a branch and Mr. Wilson brought it down here, but on the way some of the berries dropped off. There will be berries on those canes yet for a week, though they commenced picking and selling by the crate on the 6th of July. My raspberries, further north, were all gone as much as a week ago. Considering the fact that the bushes are apparently ex - tremely healthy, and the fact that the crop ripens so as to begin picking and selling by the crate on the 6th of July and follows the bearing season right along for nearly a month, it is certainly a remarkable berry. With me the Cuthbert is a little tender; the Thwack is too soft for market; the Kedtield is too small, the color is not good, and it is too soft; I have Miller's red and other varieties of the reds, but in my judgment I have seen nothing else that I consider equal to this Wallace. </seg>
            <seg id="p221">CURRANT CULTURE. BY L. (&gt;. WILLIAMS, KEARNEY, NEB. i main years I have considered currants one of the most profitable fruits we have, and it enjoys a unique position among our .fruits from Hie fact that it stands alone on our markets. It is not placed in competition with the southern fruits. There is where we suffer largely with our fruits here — from southern fruits coming into our markets. The currant is not grown south, and we do not get the Michigan currants until later in the sea - son. S&lt;&gt; it seems to me that if we can cultivate the currant suc - cessfully here we will find almost an unbounded market for it in the future. I consider as one of the essential points of success the selec - tion of good, strong-growing varieties that will produce large, handsome berries. I believe the Red Dutch ought to be dis - i-arded. I would place as the leader the Victoria, which has borne more fruit for me by 50 per cent than the Red Dutch, and has borne better selling fruit. The berries are large and bright, and the greatest advantage the Victoria has over the Red Dutch is its lateness of ripening. It is quite an important item to hold your currants back as late as you can. A great many growers have suffered from forcing their currants on the market just as soon as they are ripe, many of them getting them on the market by the Fourth of July. The fact is that nobody wants to put up currants at that time of year, the markets are dull and you can't sell them. The Victoria will hold its fruit for a month after it is colored if the season is reasonably favorable. If there should happen to be heavy rains, of course there would be more or less waste, but as a rule I would hold currants until after the Fourth before putting them on the market. Another essential point in currant growing is to have MR Er less shade. I planted a thousand Victoria one spring five r six years ago in the open soil. They were large, fine bushes </seg>
            <seg id="p222">il made a splendid growth and set full of fruit buds, but up last spring they have not borne enough to pay the first cost the plants. They suffer from the dry winters where they planted in the open. Planted between the trees in the cherry hard the same varieties have borne heavily year after year, other point in favor of shade is that the bushes will hold ■ir fruit longer than bushes planted in the open soil. In view these facts I believe that currants should always be planted ong orchard trees, and the orchard trees should be planted se enough to give quite a little shade to the currants. I The Fay's Prolific is a variety that has been discussed before iety. and while some prize it very highly, others con - mn it utterly. Mr. Hess, a neighbor of mine, has grown the iy's Prolific very successfully and ha*s had remarkably fine ait. I don't question the size of the fruit at all, but its pro- Icness. My father began growing the Fay's the first year he me out to this country. He paid flO a dozen for the plants, id I am sure, he would l&gt;e glad to get his money back. I tnally they bear a crop of excellent berries, but they are too y bearers for profit. There are other varieties like the Pom ia, which friend Wilson here has tried. I would like to hear in and others speak of them. Mr. Yaher: How about the North Star? Mr. Williams: 1 haven't tried them. Mr. Terry reported at the meeting of on state society a few years ago that they were no better than the Bed 1 Mitch, or not enough better to warrant pushing. Mr. Bombbbobb: How about the white currants? Mr. Williams: I consider the white currants profitable grown on a small Male. If I were planting a few currant bushes I think I should plant not over one-fourth white currants and I should plant the White Grape. Mil McIntosh: Have you tried the Cherry currant? Mk. Williams: Yes, in a small way. I consider it a valuable </seg>
            <seg id="p223">220 '■ bash, perhaps more reliable than the Fay's, but it doesn't have the capacity of the Victoria. It is a slow grower. Mr. McIxtosh : I notice that the &lt; "berry sells higher than other varieties in Chicago. Mr. Williams: Yes, 1 think that is true on account of its size. Mr. Raymond: I have been growiag currants quite exten - sively and I would say that one advantage of the Victoria is that it retains its foliage much better than the Red Dutch and some other varieties. The varieties that drop their foliage early are not so valuable for the reason that it exposes the fruit to the sun and the fruit is injured thereby. But the Victoria is not the currant we are looking for; we haven't got a currant yet that fills the bill. The Victoria is second rate in quality. It looks pretty nice in a box, and people buy it because it looks nice. We want a currant a little larger than the Victoria and better in quality. Another mistake that Bro. Williams made was when he told you that you could take your time in picking currants. It is true that there is considerable leeway in the time of picking currants, and while we like to please our custo - mers, and like to give them a good article, yet if they demand half-ripe currants, sell them to them. Almost every housewife who buys them intends to make them up into jelly and she wants it to look nice. She don't care so much about the quality; she likes to hold up a glass of jelly to a neighbor lady and say ■I»oesn't that look lovely?" just because it is dear and nice. If yon are going to have nice clear jelly you have got to have it made before the currants are too ripe. STKAWBEKK1ES. BY E. F. STEPHENS, CRETE. Notwithstanding all that has been said regarding the ing of the strawberry and the effort our society has made to spread correct information and encourage planting, I noticed </seg>
            <seg id="p224">221 *TKA WnERKIKBi &lt; with some surprise this summer that the markets of Lincoln and the principal towns west through the state were supplied to a considerable extent with strawberries from Hood Itiver, Ore gon, Utah, and Colorado. The cost of express per case from Oregon to Lincoln is considerable, and to other towns in the state west of this line not much less. As a rule I noticed that Oregon, Utah, and Colorado strawberries sold in the various towns visited at from 10 to 12^ cents per quart. While (artless and improper methods have not yielded large returns in the grvwiag of the strawberry in the hands of the average planter over a portion of the state, by what is called dry farming, there has been developed in recent years in our state so many successful irrigation canals, covering in their acreage about one million acres, that all of these minor fruits can be grown as readily in Nebraska as in Colorado, Utah, or Oregon, since on this one million acres of land already under cultivation we have soil equal to or superior in facilities to any which they have in the states above noted. The waters of the Platte, the different forks of the Loup and the Republican, with their tributaries, are more easily led out into the valleys and lands bordering them than in any other state where irrigation is attempted. The water supply is quite certain, abundant in amount, and very easily led out and ap - plied. Under these conditions we should at least supply our local markets and should cultivate and develop these markets until they use at least ten times as much fruit as is at present con - sumed. When fruit can be obtained fresh from the planter in the best possible condition, and only a few hours from the field, it will be consumed in much larger quantities, and likewise when abundant production brings the prices down to one-half the prices now obtained for the small product now sold, the profits will yet be large and the consumption increased ten-fold. In der irrigation there is good profit in growing strawberries at f 1.50 per ease for the local markets, which saves express charges and secures return of cratesi </seg>
            <seg id="p225">MSBRA8KA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCI ET Y. 222 As an illustration of the rapid increase in the consumption of fruit under lessening prices, the Pacific Express agent at North Platte stated to me this season that t lie reduction in price from f 1.75 to f 1.10 per rase on peaches enabled him to increase the number of cases of peaches handled by his company and consumed in North Platte from about :ioo annually to 2,000 &gt; last season, all supplied by one grower at Ogden, Utah. This gentleman also states that the consumption of strawberries in North Platte reaches l.ooo cases in a single season. West of the line of Columbus I know of only one party worfe - ing the strawberry extensively for market — Throckmorton &amp; Griffith, of Albion, who are growing more strawberries than any other parties in the state of whom I have heard, irrigating from Heaver creek. West of these gentlemen I have heard of only one party who grows so much as an acre of strawberries. W. L. Park, superintendent of the North Platte division of the Union Pacific, grew this season a scant acre of strawberries, from which he picked 4,000 quarts, securing a net price of about 10c per quart, or $400. This was Mr. Park's first attempt. With increased experience and a narrower list of varieties his men will no doubt secure much better results. Selection of Boil. — Avoid low, w-et ground and also lands strongly alkalied. Choose rich, deep, loam soil, although the sandy soils will answer if heavily fertilized. Heavily manure with fine old manure on any soil, since on a crop which pays so much jK»r acre as the strawberry it pays to grow the utmost pos - sible on each and every acre. In preparing the soil, would plow and subsoil to the depth of fifteen inches or more if possible. In selecting land would prefer that which has a very gentle fall, giving easier control of the flow of water as needed. Would plant in rows 3£ feet apart, and if the plats are so prepared that the centers of the rows are a little above the general level there will be less likelihood of flooding the crowns of the plants in subsequent watering. Cul - tivation should be weekly or oftener, and watering may be </seg>
            <seg id="p226">NT ISA WHERRIES. 223 - I needed once in two weeks. Always cultivate as soon as possible after watering. In covering for winter use slough hay rather than straw, owing to the liability of weed seed or grain in the straw. The only drawback or serious risk in the growing of straw - berries in any quantity in any of the irrigable valleys of the tate is what we call the May freeze, to which we are liable. Vccidental instances in great number seem to show that if m an be turned on from the ditches on nights when a told wave s expected, there is almost a certainty that the freeze will be &gt;revented. In every case I have heard of so far where this was one no harm resulted from the freeze. Desirable pointB in the selection of varieties might be named in the following order: First, solidity and ftrnu m&lt;l. brilliancy of color or attractiveness in appearance; third. Flavor is of less importance. Picking. — In picking I would plan to grade, putting only fruit of best quality in certain boxes, everything inferior in other boxes. Be careful to pick with stems on and without bruising. Be careful to employ the best help, that will pick and grade ex - actly as desired. LThis secures the best possible prices for 80 per cent of the ait. The remainder had better be sold at what it is worth than to reduce the price of all of it by being sold together. In our En experience this season our first-class fruit brought from 10 12£ cents the season through. The inferior, which we graded t and sold by itself, brought 8 cents. Marketing. — If the market is near at hand and fruit can be taken directly to town no special care will be required for cool - ing. But if the fruit is to be held twenty-four hours before it is consumed or must be shipped 10 to 100 miles or more, it will be advantageous to be prepared with a chill room and cool the fruit carefully soon after picking, to be sure it is cool when it starts to market. If necessary to ship the fruit a considerable distance after cooling (and in cooling fruit remember it must </seg>
            <seg id="p227">224 be only cooled and not chilled) the fruit will carry to market much better if each quart box is wrapped in a sheet of parchment paper, making almost air-tight packages. The size of the sheet suitable for this purpose will be 18 by 18 inches. When we have supplied our local markets with all they can be induced to consume, we should then turn our attention to other and more distant markets. For this work Nebraska has unusual advantages. The Union Pacific, Lae Burlington, the Elkhorn, Rock Island, and other systems all run fast train ser - vice with refrigerator cars carrying our fruit east and west, north and south, giving us unusual facilities for reaching dis - tant markets as well as surroundings. Other communities have had to wait for refrigerator cars and fast freight trains until a large production of fruit brought such service. We have it al - ready established at our doors. Having mentioned some of the advantages which the irrigable districts of Nebraska have in the growing of the strawberry, I would like to mention the successful work of some who are grow - ing the strawberry depending on the moisture which nature gives through rainfall and which can be conserved by suitable cultiva - tion. T. C. Jackson, of Purdum, in the northwest part of Blaine county, raised this season over 1,000 quarts of strawberries on a plat 50 by ~2C&gt;() feet, giving the same frequent cultivation and field culture. This quantity of fruit was in addition to what his friends and neighbors, children and pickers consumed. Most of the fruit brought him from 10 to 12^ cents per quart, selling a portion of it at home, but shipping most of it to towns west of him. He is located in a neighborhood where 95 per cent of the people arc confident that fruit cannot be grown. The meth ods which he has so successfully applied to orcharding on that elevated table are yielding excellent success in the growing of the strawberry. Briefly, the essentials of success in the growing of small fruits and the strawberry in particular on the elevated table lands </seg>
            <seg id="p228">225 STRAWBERRIES. of Nebraska, which are also often dry, and where farm crops not infrequently fail, are, lirst, that the ground shall be very deeply prepared, preferably the fall before, that it should catch as much snow and frost as possible through the winter, leaving ii considerable amount of moisture in the early spring. Plants are best planted in the early spring because at that period but little growth has been made. The leaves are either wanting or are very small. There is but little evaporation. The air is more likely to be cold and moist at the time of planting. Success is easy and quite certain. Planting is usually done be - hind a spade as you would plant a hedge plant, in rows 3^ feet apart. The earth is tramped solid to the plant. Cultivation is frequent. Should the weather be dry and very windy they should be cultivated three or four times a week until they get established. This lessens the drifting of the soil and increases the humidity of the low lying atmosphere next to the ground. After plants are established cultivate until September 15th, which should retain needed moisture, or the latter portion of the season the plants can be mulched. Kemember now that where the grower depends entirely upon rainfall, and in certain locali - ties the rainfall maw be as little as l(i inches, it is not wise to allow the matted rows to be more than 15 to 18 inches in width. It is at once apparent to any one that a row 12 to 18 inches in width does not require as much moisture as a row 3J feet in width, and it leaves room for that frequent cultivation which, with our soil and climate, conserves moisture. After these rows are established it is practicable to mulch the middles and cease cultivation. At the approach of winter they should be covered with slough hay put on if possible just before a rain or snow, that it might stick or be Matted together to pre - vent its rolling off with high winds. At intervals of ten feet, or between the third and fourth rows, and at like intervals there - after, open spaces six feet in width should be maintained to can y a windrow of hay.

LUENCE OF THE HONEY BEE ON THE FRUIT CROP. BY L. D. STILSON, YORK. No person who has ever given the subject of bee culture, or has looked after the relationship of bees and fruit growing to any considerable extent will deny that bees play a very import - ant part in the great work of proper pollenization or fertiliza- tion. Flowers are an absolute necessity for the bee, so, too, is the bee a necessity for the flower. The flowers by the delicate perfume they give off attract the bee to the nectaries, from which they extract the honey there secreted, but while there en - gaged in extracting the honey they become dusted with the pollen grains with which the antlers are covered and released when properly ripened. This pollen or fertilizing dust is carried by the bees from the antlers of the male blossom to the stigmata of the female blossom of the same species, otherwise no seeds will develop, and consequently no fruit will be raised. Some - times we have abundant blossoms, while continued rainy weather prevents the proper ripening of the pollen, or cloudy weather prevents the bees from flving. so that there is no mix- tnre of pollen and therefore no fruit. Many of you will recollect the abundant bloom of 1893. The fruit set in great profusion. Many speculated as to where such quantities of apples were to find a market. A month later, when the apples began to be one-half to three-fourth of an inch through they began falling, and in a few days all were down. On cutting these fallen apples open the core was perfectly formed but not </seg>
            <seg id="p230">a developed seed, showing that no fertilization had taken place. Many of you today are mourning for want of a prospective apple crop, when your trees were loaded with bloom; heavy downpours of rain washed many of the flowers clean of pollen, and when the sun shone again the bees,were too few to carry what pollen re - mained to all the blossoms, and today the majority of the apples on the trees are in the immediate vicinity of the apiary or in line of flight of bees on the sunny days following the rains. An - other fact is here developed, the apples such a year as the pres - ent are small, ill-shapen, and ill-flavored. This is evidently the result of in-breeding, or fertilization of the blossoms from the male blossoms of the same tree, while if the pollen were prop - erly ripened, and the weather suitable for the free flight of bees, the pollen would have mixed more from other trees and cross - fertilization effected, and more vigorous and better fruit the result. Probably in no state, as a whole, do the honey bees play so im- K&gt;rtant a part in fruit raising as in Nebraska. With few natural roves to harbor insects, there is less insect life, capable of car - ving pollen at time of fruit bloom, consequently we must de - pend on the honey bee for this work; and the thoroughness of tieir work is shown, I think, in my own cherry orchard, -where tiis year was gathered the fourteenth consecutive crop without failure, while other orchards a mile or so distant have failed f crops three to five times in the same length of time. Also &lt;ike the orchard of E. Whitcomb, of Friend, Neb., in 1893, pro - ucing 300 bushels of cherries, while orchards equally as good, utside the flight of his bees, produced none. This was an exceptional year, there being only a very few hours when bees could fly during the period of time when the pollen was ripened sufficiently for fertilization, and his bees be - ing in the immediate vicinity of the trees, these were visited first, with profitable results. Many instances of this kind have been noted at different points in our state the past years; all tending to show that the closer </seg>

Stilsox: For several years there has been quite a contro - versy as to whether bees destroy grapes. The fact is that we have a great many insects late in the season when the grape crop is ripening, and the grapes are punctured by some other i and the bees simply go there to gather up the juice. The formation of the bee's mouth is such that it is absolutely im - possible for a bee to puncture the skin of a grape. Mit. Williams: It is a question with me whether if the bee had been at work this season during the time the apple trees in blossom, we would have had a better crop of apples. I notice so far as I have been out among the orchards this year that there seems to l&gt;e a lack of fertilization. There is a scab which you see on the outside of the apple, which seems to ex - tend right to the core. This would indicate something radically wrong right at the center of the apple, and I think it is a lack of fertilization. Yet on going out last week, gathering apples for the Pottawattamie exhibit in the Wigwam, I visited an orchard where there were fifty or more swarms of bees, and 1 could see no difference in that orchard and the other orchards which I visited where there were no bees at all. It may be due to the fact that the bees couldn't work when the trees were in bloom, but so far as the bees were concerned last spring I could see no advantage from the presence of those swarms in that orchard. Mr. Stilson: You must recollect that at the time the apples were in bloom last spring we had heavy rains; and no matter how many bees you have, or how many blossoms you get, the pollen on every flower must l&gt;e perfectly ripened before it is good for anything for fertilization. If you have rain enough to wash that pollen out of the flower before it is ripened, no mat - ter how many bees you had you couldn't get any fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">229 PEACH CULTURE AND VARIETIES. PEACH (TLTl'RE AND VARIETIES. BT SILAS WILSON, ATLANTIC, IA. Mr, I'rvxidtnt: This is a very interesting subject to us all, and • ■specially to me, because I have considerable faith in \» growing in this latitude. I have believed for a good many year* that by a judicious selection of the most hardy sorts and careful cultivation we might get some peaches at least two or three years out of five. Mr. Russell has had more praetical experience in this line, perhaps, than any other man in the Missouri river valley that I could name. When he took up this busine&gt; peach growing he had great faith to begin with. Most of yonr Nebraska nurserymen and fruit growers were as skeptical about peach growing as we were over in Iowa; but Mr. Russell be - lieved in peach growing in this country. I heard him say once that he went south to select a good place for growing peaches for commercial purposes; but that after visiting a number of favored localities in the south and investigating them thor - oughly, he came back convinced that he could make peach grow - ing in Nebraska just as profitable as in any of the southern states, not excepting Georgia. Accordingly he began and ha» given it the most thorough trial of any man that I could name in this country today. He chose a good location, made a good selection of varieties, and has given his trees the most thorough care and cultivation. It was a pleasure to me to visit Mr. Rus - sell's peach orchard. Everything there is done in the most thor - ough manner. I don't believe I could make any criticism on his management of that orchard. The trees are planted just about the right distance apart and the location is on quite ele - vated ground, which is a very important thing. I believe the cause of peach culture in this country owes more to Mr. Russell than to any other man I could name. He has demonstrated the fact that it is practicable to grow peaches in Nebraska for </seg>
            <seg id="p233">230 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. menial purposes, and I believe what is true of Nebraska may be made true of southwestern Iowa. I have had no experience in peach growing as compared with Mr. Russell, but I certainly en - dorse his methods of planting and cultivation. I have traveled east and west; in the Grand River valley in Colorado; in Cali - fornia and the south, and T have seen no place where they give their peach orchards the care and cultivation that Mr. Russell gives his. And he is bringing you results. it comes to varieties of peaches it is very difficult to say what is best. Of course, I represent a country on the northern limits of possible peach growing. I have tested a good many va rieties in a limited way, but have had more experience with Bokara No. 3 than any other. About ten or twelve years ago Prof. Budd imported from Bokara a number of peaches. Tn common with all the other horticulturists of Iowa, I had no faith in them at that time, but I secured some scions of those peaches. There were six or seven varieties of them. I had np stocks to graft or bud them on except wild plum, so I collar - grafted them and grew them two years. The one labeled "No. 3" made a better growth, had better foliage, ripened its wood better in the fall than any of the others, and thus attracted my attention. It was the first one of the lot to produce fruit, and it produced very fine fruit. When they had the Bluegrass Palace at Creston I exhibited peaches there of this variety that were 8i inches in circumference. The people made all sorts of fun of me and said they were California peaches. And even when I took, some of them into our home town some of my neighbors looked at me in utter astonishment and said: "Did you raise those ont there?" I said "Yes, I grew those," and they could hardly be - lieve that such peaches could be grown there. The other vari - eties that I got at the same time-^or the different numbers, rather — were small, inferior peaches, and many of them killed to the snow line, but the variety I got for No. 3 has never killed ; it has survived 28° below zero. I disposed of all the other vari - eties a number of years ago, so there can be no question about </seg>
            <seg id="p234">• what I got in the first place being No. 3. Another peach which I believe to be valuable is the Bailey. It has been successfully grown in eastern Iowa for forty years and it is said that it can be depended on for two or three crops oat of five. Last winter was a test winter. We had 25° below zero at oar town, a degree of cold which is jrenerally supposed to be fatal to the peach crop. Down at Glenwood, at the horticultural meeting last win - ter, the general opinion was that there would be no peaches there at all, and consequently I felt pretty blue. I thought if they had no peaches there I would certainly have none. So when I went home I examined my peach buds and found most of them killed. Later on I found that the Hill's Chili, Champion, Crosby, were entirely killed; that the Bailey would have just a sprinkling of peat-lies, and that the Bokara would have more than any of them. That variety survived 25° below zero and still produced a pood crop, and the peaches are on the trees to show for it today. So I think we should not be discouraged. I have seen the Crosby, Champion, and Hill's Chili winter-kill, but I think we should hold on to these new seedlings and in that way develop a list of varieties that will stand our climate, and I believe we can do it. And I want to say right here (including myself) that fruit growers are the most skeptical class of men in this country. They don't have faith in their own business nor in themselves as they ought to have. This seems to be a characteristic of the American people. Three months ago we believed that we had no navy and that Spain would come over here and blow us out of the water. I believed that everything that got in range of I our jruns would go down as it has gone down. I believe in the United States of America. I believe our country is equal or sn - perior to any other country in the world [applause], and I be - lieve that we have the best part of the United States right here in the Mississippi valley. [Applause.] All we need is more faith in ourselves and in our country; then if we go ahead and </seg>

The conditions in eastern Nc braska are very similar to those of western Iowa, and I have faith enough to believe that this is destined to be distinctively a fruit country. If there is any one who has any questions to ask in regard to this peach business, I shall be glad to mm them the best I can. nisii Mr. Jackson: What distance do you consider the best for planting peach tre&lt; ■- Mr. Wilson: About twenty feet apart each \v;iy where you plant peaches exclusively. I l&gt;elieve in heading the trees in so as to stock them up as much as possible. Mr. Brown: When do you cut otT those branches? Mr. Wilson: In April. March, or any time along in the spring. Mr. Jackson: How much do you cut back? Mb. Wilson: All of the previous year's growth where the limbs stand away out. It throws the growth into the center of tbe tree and makes a more stocky tree. Mr. Brininc;: Do you know any way to prevent the peaches from rotting on the trees? The Alexander, especially, rots very badly with me. Mr. Wilson: I think that is owing to the season more than anything else. We have been troubled very little in Iowa with peach rot. Mr. Bruning: Mine rot every year. Mr. Hogg: Onr friends seem to think that the question of fruit growing is confined to the Mississippi ami Missouri val - leys. We have the great Platte valley up west here which I don't like to see trampled on. I live a hundred miles west of this and for the last ten years I haven't missed a crop of peaches but two years, and my peach trees todav are loaded with fruit. I don't want the impression to go out that we can't raise fruit anywhere in the state except right along the river banks. Out west we have ;i many people who think we can't grow </seg>
            <seg id="p236">233 RASPBERRIES. fruit any place except along the Missouri river, but out at my place I have proved that we can. This thing of confining fruit growing to the eastern part of Nebraska is all a mistake. Mr. Russell: Mr. Wilson advised giving more attention to the development of new varieties particularly adapted to oar conditions. I think he is on the right track there; we have not paid enough attention to these new varieties. Mr. Bomberger: I don't think we want to get so interested in peaches as to all go into the business on a large scale. It is true that we have been able to grow peaches quite successfully for the past four or five years, but I attribute this to our late dry falls which allowed the peach wood to ripen up thoroughly. Before those years we had summer or fall weather that would leave the wood in such shape that it would not winter at all. In my particular locality the trees killed right to the ground. As soon as those conditions return we may have more or less trouble with our peach industry again. I think, however, that by giving proper attention to the location of our peach orchards, and by the use of different methods of shading or -whitewashing the trees to get greater hardiness of wood, we can in a measure supply the conditions that will make the trees a success on our own grounds. I think we should pay more attention to those things than to the variety or the thermometer. KASPBERRIES. The subject of raspberries has been gone over so many times that it is impossible for me to write anything new, and I will only undertake to give the cultivation of the blackcap as prac - ticed on our place. The soil should be of the best, or should be made rich at least one year before setting them out. Timber or brush land I consider the best. North and east slopes are BY A. VAN KIRK, GLENWOOI), IA. </seg>

The rows should be seven feet apart and about two feet in the row, or close enough so as to make a solid hedgerow, thereby protecting one another, with the rows running north and south and sidewise of the hill if possible. The ground should be pre - pared for the plants the year previous to setting them out by keeping it clean and fall plowing to free the ground of weed seed, cut worms and other insects that work on the young plants. It also makes the ground loose and mellow so that the plants can be set early in the spring. Early setting is quite an ad - vantage as one geti a letter stand and growth. The best we ever grew were set in March. The T&gt;est plants are grown by placing the ends of the vines perpendicularly into the ground about two inches the first of September or when the ends as - sume a purple or snake-like appearance. Plants grown in this way cannot be sold for four or five dollars a thousand. An easier way to grow them is by running a lister with one horse between the rows, covering them lightly. As fast as we nrark the rows out with a lister we dig the plants and set them out with as little exposure as possible, taking care that the fresh dirt is placed all around the plant and pressed down firmly, then filling up with a little loose earth, leaving the crown just under the surface. We consider this method of planting the best, as the dirt can be plowed in. covering up the weeds and putting the plants more firmly into the ground. They have a tendency to work up on a ridge in a hilly country. Care should be taken that they do not wash out by making small ditches to throw the water out of the furrov The cultivation should be done frequently and shallow. Do not wait for the weeds to come up, but cultivate often. We hoe once before fruiting, and immediately after, and run the Planet Jr. cultivator nearly all the time. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">S IN PEAR GROW 235 The first summer after planting the top should be pinched off at about eighteen inches high. After that about thirty to thirty - six inches, only pinching them back once in a season. In the spring all of the old wood and part of the new must be pruned off. The fruit should be gathered as soon as it will part easily from the vine. AVe furnish 4-qnart carrying stands to the pick - ers, requiring each one to pick his half-row and return the boxes to the fruit house where they are inspected aud placed in the crates. The berries must be picked clean at least every other day, as a few over-ripe berries will spoil the sale of a crate. We manage to get nearly all of the berries gathered by noon before the heat of the day. and to market as soon after as possible, and the fruit was received in good shape. We ship nearly all of our fruit, but the closer the grower can be to the consumer, the bet - ter it is for both. After the vines have been winter-killed, or the blossoms frost bitten, there is considerable after-growth, or sec - ond crop, and they are always the largest and finest fruit. By encouraging this and propagating along this line, we might get a valuable addition to the raspberry. FIFTEEN YEARS' EXPERIMENTS IN IOWA PEAK (JKnW- ING. HY M. .1. &lt;JRAHAM, APEL, IA. The person assigning this subject to me must have had some knowledge of my efforts in this line, for it was in the spring of 1883 that I made my first planting of pears, — one tree each of Bartlert and Longworth. I was told that pear growing in Iowa was in the "experimental stage," and that I had better go slow. The Bartlett was planted near a blighting crab apple, and early fell a victim to fire blight. And right here I will digress to say that this represents the experience of nine farmers out of ten, with pears, — they plant one or two trees in the garden near the ever present and worthless crab apple, upon which blight in </seg>
            <seg id="p239">236 2M NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. some form is usually present, and sooner or later the disease is communicated to the pear; it dies, and the owner exclaims, "You can't grow pears in Iowa !" A few years later my attention was directed to the success of Mr. Shaw, of Qftrdefl Grove, la., in growimg certain varieties of the finer pears, — Howell and Sheldon in particular, — bo I planted ten each of the two above named and of Flemish Beauty. About this time f learned that hardiness of tree was one of the features most desired in pear growing in Iowa, and accord - ingly, in the spring of 1889, planted forty trees, comprising four - teen varieties, of the Russian and Chinese pears. These grew finely and soon began to bear, when I found the fruit small and of inferior quality, unfit for any use. In the spring of 1S!»4 I top-grafted the Russian trees with the finest varieties of French and American pears. The grafts made a strong growth and everything was lovely until June, is!t."&gt;, when the Cicada, or 17-year locusts, appeared in large numbers. These insects sub - sist by inserting their beaks through the bark of the trees and sucking out the sap. As a result of this operation the bark on the trunks and main limbs of the trees was perforated with minute holes, through which the sap exuded. Within a few days all the Russian varieties, also Flemish Beauty and a few others, perished with blight. These were removed and burned. In many cases the blight began on the terminal shoots of the Russian pears, yet in very few instances were the top grafts affected, and they only succumbed after the limbs were killed below the point of union. Prior to the advent of the Cicada, and the exit of the Russian pears, I planted fiOO dwarf trees, mostly Angouleme, Anjou, and Howell, also about two hundred standard trees, including Boussock. Clairgeau and Kieffer, and a few of the newer kinds for trial. These were all subjected to the ravages of the locusts. but the loss of trees from blight was small— less than 3 per cent. LOn April 2o. 1*!»7, when the greater portion of the dwarf and me of the standard trees were almost in full bloom, there oc- </seg>
            <seg id="p240">237 curred a hailstorm of great severity which cut off all the fruit ■pan and killed mam of the brandies back two or three feet. Notwithstanding this treatment very few 4 blight veloped and the loss of trees was less than one per cent. Now (or results: The Lougworth tree, first above referred to, is healthy and loaded with fruit; the standard trees, of varieties other than KietTer, are not bearing but are well tilled with fruit buds for a &lt; -rop next year. The dwarfs are bearing, from a few specimens up to one half a bushel each, and promise a large crop next season. I have found that the French pears, and their seedlings grown in this country and usually designated as American {tears, are fully hardy, and that they are as free from blight as are our common varieties of apple trees. In fact, there is more blight today on one Yellow Transparent apple tree in my orchard than there is all together on one thousand pear trees. It appears that varieties of j&gt;ears (and of apples as well) orig - inating several degrees south of our latitude, are much less liable to blight when grown in this section than are those originating north of us. For this reason, etq&gt;ecially for general planting, we have much to hope for in such pears M Koouee. Alamo, Lex - ington, and Krull. MOINTAIX KVKIMKEKNS. I1Y J. I'. UUNLAr, DWIGHT. The Ponderosa or Bull Pine is the hardiest of all trees for the dry plains. It thrives and grows healthy trees on dry ridges where the Box Elder and Cot ton wood can hardly live. In the valleys the cold of winter nor heat of summer, dry weather nor hailstorm, seem to do it any harm. Its native home is far out on the plains. From an altitude of about 4,000 feet above the sea level, it climbs on up the mountain until it reaches an altitude of 9,000 feet. Specimens of it may be found in the </seg>

It is a good timber tree and excellent for fuel. It frowi about as fast M the Austrian pine and is a good tree to cultivate in all parts of Nebraska. The White Pine is the principal forest tree in the rainy dis - tricts of the Hocky Mountains. Scattering specimens are found as low as 5,0(10 feet, and as far up as 12,000 feet. This is a good timber tree, but worthless for fuel. In their native home they grow very close together. Large bodies of this timber may be found where trees six to eight inches in diameter and forty to fifty feet high will average about three trees on the same space occupied by one hill of corn in Nebraska. But in the course of time the smaller ones die out and the stronger ones occupy the space until they become large trees. In the course of years the leaves accumulate in the forests to the depth of several In the latter part of the summer when the rains are not so heavy these leaves become dry enough to burn, and some - times the wild fire burns large districts until stopped by creeks. In these burnt districts in the course of years the surface be - comes covered with moss and huckleberry brush, and then a thick growth of young pines comes up, and owing to the cool short growing season there, these young forests make but a slow growth, but when transplanted to the plains they make a fairly rapid growth and appear to be well adapted for culti - vation in Nebraska^ The Silver Cedar much resembles the Red Cedar in wood and form of tree, but has a rich silver tint and holds its color well in winter. Its native home is from about 5,000 feet to 7,000 •a level. This tree is worthy of cultivation as an ornamental tree. The" Silver Spruce, Piccn pitngens, is the most beautiful of all evergreens. Its symmetrical form and brilliant hues are not equaled by any other tree. Its native home is between the alti - tudes of 5,04)0 and 10.000 feet. It is hardy in Nebraska, and grows about one half as fast as the Bull Pine. Its timber is </seg>
            <seg id="p242">239 of little use, its main value being as an ornamental tree, but for this purpose it stands first of all. The Engleman, or Blue Spruce, grows at about the same altitude, or perhaps a little higher than the Silver iffce. It is about as rapid a grower, not quite so hardy, timber of about the same value, but its thick blue foliage makes it worthy of cultivation. The Concolor, Douglas Spruce, Balsam Fir and Trailing Juni - per are native trees of the Rocky Mountains, and are all worthy of cultivation where the conditions are favorable to their growth. THE CULTURE OF BLACKBERRIES. The culture of blackberries has been discussed so often that I do not know the necessity of writing a paper were it not for the fact that we are constantly reminded by inquiries regarding the method of cultivation, etc., from those who do not attend our meetings, and fail to get the benefit of these discussions. It is easy to refer them to some state report, where they usually get the information they desire. The blackberry is one of our most valuable small fruits, and hould not fail to be found in all fruit gardens, and it is found uite profitable if grown for commercial purposes near the arger towns, where ample facilities for shipping are at hand hen the local market heroines orentoeked. With the con tantly growing demand for this fruit, we feel encouraged to ncrease our acreage. As to location, would select land sloping o the north, if possible. Would prefer soil that had been fanned or some time, and if any fertilizer is needed would enrich with manure. Our prairie or timber soil is originally too rich, and roduces too large a quantity of wood to get the best results. he best field of berries that I have known in the vicinii ouncil Bluffs was planted about fourteen years ago on ground lat had been farmed for a number of years before, and had lost </seg>
            <seg id="p243">240 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. its original fertility for producing corn, as it was not considered first-class corn ground any more, and there has not been a year since it was planted that it would not produce a paying crop of berries, and some years a very profitable crop. The land was, a« I have described, slightly sloping to the north and west. Since I have been raising blackberries I remember two patches that I was compelled to abandon and plant to other fruit. In both cases the land was very rich and would make a wonderful growth of canes, but produce very little fruit. Soil and location have a great deal to do with the success. We make another mistake by allowing our rows to become matted too much, ('an- should be taken to keep the young shoots well thinned during the season of cultivation. I have some of mine planted among the fruit trees, and divide the distance between the fruit trees from seven to ten feet. Seven feet, however, is too close. I think nine feet about the proper distance, but in my way of planting the distance will depend somewhat on the distance the fruit trees arc apart. Where I planted by themselves I have the rows about nine feet apart. The shade of the trees does not seem to be detrimental. I usually plant potatoes or some- hoed crop the first year; after that the plants will take up the ground. Do not allow the weeds to get possession of your ground at any time. I have had good success by planting sucker plants, although I would prefer good root cutting plants in order to secure a per - stand the first year. I have the Snyder, Western Triumph, and Stone Hardy, but my principal crop is Snyder. The yield is from 150 to 200 cases per acre. To any one desiring to engage in growing fruit for commercial purposes they will find the blackberry among the most profitable. In the present crop, which is just being harvested, we realize very satisfactory re - turns. </seg>

While our town is no large, we think it is one of the best of its size — if not the ver best — in the state. There is more business done in this littl town than perhaps in any other one of its size in the state. am sorry I can't turn the town over to you, but I am not autho ized to do that; I am simply a farmer like the rest of you, bu I can assure you that you are welcome to this town. I also extend you a hearty welcome from the Johnson County Horticultural Society. We regard this one of the best counties in the state for fruit-growing — in fact, I think we can raise al - most anything here that can be raised in any other part of the state. I believe they do raise some things in Kansas that we don't raise here. [Laughter.] Now, Mr. President, it is late and I will not take up more of your time, but I bid you all a hearty welcome to this place. Ev - erything we have is yours. Every latchstring hangs out, and we shall be glad to have you, one and all, visit us in our homes. [Applause.] RESPONSE. BY EX-GOV. FUBNAS, BROWNVILLE.

            <seg id="p248">PROCEEDINGS OF SUMMER MEETING. 245 However, I am sure that I voice the feeling and sentiment of every member of this society when 1 say that I thank you for the hearty welcome you extend to this organization. I want to congratulate all upon this fact: That finally a sum - mer meeting — one of the important meetings of this state society — has been called to meet in one of the oldest counties in the state, and where, perhaps with a single exception, the first fruit tree planting was made in Nebraska. Mr. Masters, of Otoe county, probably planted the first fruit trees in Nebraska; the next planting was done in this county near Peru. So you are now met in a part of the state where horticulture took its rise, so to speak, in Nebraska. It was my good fortune to have been associated more or lew with the pioneers in tree planting in this state, consequently I feel like retrospecting a little; looking back to see where we started and what has been accomplished. It was my good for - tune to be one of the original organizers of this society, and as I look back from this time to that and see what has been accom - plished in this state for horticulture, I feel a very great pride in what has been done. When I first came here from Ohio we didn't know whether we could raise fruit here or not, but in looking over the country we decided to try it anyway ; that was the best we could do under the circumstances. All the intelligent efforts made proved quite successful, and after a while we began to think that perhaps we could raise fruit along the river, and the planting has gradually spread out over the state until I think it is safe to say in regard to fruit growing in Nebraska that wherever it has been attempted intelligently it has succeeded without any doubt. It is true, perhaps, that we have certain climatic conditions in these river counties that are not to be had in some of the more western counties, but the fact remains that a careful selection of varieties and proper cultivation have given good results in every portion of the state. When we first came to the state it was all wild and untried. We didn't know what to plant. We came from a region where they raised R. I. Greening, Yellow Bellflower, Spitzenberg, etc., and we thought </seg>
            <seg id="p249">246 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. nothing would do but we must plant those same varieties here So far as my observation and experience are concerned those old varieties have not proved a success in Nebraska. Those o as who started in with those old varieties to which we had bee accustomed back east, had some costly experience. Some tim ago Mr. Masters, Mr. Morton, and myself were estimating wha has been the cost of our permanent plant. I think we summe it up that the trees we had standing at that time had cost u about f 100 apiece. Mr. President, I trust you will pardon this little digression. I am glad to meet with the men who are pushing this work for - ward in our state, and again thanking the good people here for the hearty reception they have given this society, I will not now take more of your time. [Applause.] </seg>
            <seg id="p250">WINTER MEETING. The annual meeting of the Nebraska State Horticultural So - ciety convened in Nebraska Hall, State University, Lincoln, Neb., Tuesday, January 9th, 1900, at 2 o'clock p. m., President Geo. A. Marshall presiding. The various papers and discussions will be found in another part of this volume. President Marshall delivered the following PRESIDENTS i ADDRESS. Fellow Members and Friend* of the Horticultural Society: An - other twelve months have rapidly rolled around and we find ourselves again convened in annual session. The very sight of this lecture room brings beams of sunshine in pleasant thoughts of the many past meetings which have been held here. It is with pleasure that we meet and greet each other. The horticul - turist is always hungry to learn from his co-workers, to know their past experience, etc., and perfectly willing to impart his in exchange for theirs. There is no information that is so use - ful, or that is remembered so well, as that gathered from per - sonal contact of mind with mind. Hence the great good of these meetings. Here each one is the gainer — receives more •than he gives — yet no one is the loser. Information given by one is received by all, and thus in a meeting of one hundred persons the average person will get one hundred times as much as he gives; or in other words, the gain will be one hundred fold. 'The ordinary horticulturist has no secrets. He is not so selfish as to wish to receive information always and never impart any. In the field of agriculture, grain, vegetables, etc., can be planted, grown and harvested in one season and the planter has the experience of the plant's entire life. His mi* 1 takes all being fresh in his mind an effort can be made to avoid them the second year; thus much more rapid progress can be made without the aid of his neighbor's experience than in hor- </seg>
            <seg id="p251">248 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETT, ticulture, for in horticulture it takes from ten to twenty-five years to complete this amount of work. Information once gained should never be thrown away or carelessly lost. We certainly never were given all these ad - vantages and privileges to simply and selfishly hem in and smother out existence. When our forefathers first crossed the Missouri river and said "We will raise fruit in Nebraska,'* they were ridiculed and called foolish ; yet by never-failing faith and untiring effort they have shown to us and the world that these fertile prairies can be made to blossom as the rose, and that no home need be with - out such blessings. It is well for us to consider what we are doing for the world and posterity. Now that we as a society are not so hampered financially, can we not look forward to the time when the office of the Secretary shall be kept open the year round and be a sort of bureau of information, and where specimens of fruit can be sent to be named. I believe it best to locate the Secre - tary's office permanently at Lincoln. This done, we can com - municate with the outside world easiest. To give this a trial, I would recommend that the Secretary keep open office in Lin - coln at least two or three days each week, and do all of the society's correspondence from there. This would, at least, lay the foundation for what we desire, and we would commence to reap the fruits as soon as we began the work ; thus there would be no loss, even though reverses should prevent us from reach - ing the millennium. We should continue to encourage the work in the farmers' institutes, as that is one of the very best means of spreading horticultural information. In case the Agricultural Society should decide to not hold a state fair this year, it would be well to consider where we could hold our annual fruit show to best advertise the state. We now know what we may depend upon the coming season for premiums, and are not hampered as we were last year. We should acquaint ourselves better with the various horticultural societies of the adjoining states. Some </seg>

The extreme cold of last winter has brought considerable loss aJl over the central states, and has taught some valuable lessons. The more tender varieties that were creeping in grad - ually for the last ten or twelve years, and making quite rapid strides the last two or three years, were taken back a step, and the planter reminded that hardiness is one of the principal points to look after, and that the tree must be given a chance to mature for winter; also that none were cultivated too much the first part of the season, but that it is possible to give too clean cultivation through August and September. Trees that were considered perfectly hardy under some peculiar circum - stances were badly injured, while others in the same neighbor - hood, of more tender varieties, came through with much lew injury, showing that hardiness alone did not solve the problem that time. Last winter was an all-around object lesson that will bear considerable study. CHANCELLOR'S ADDRESS. DR. CHARLES E. BESSET. Mr. President, and Members of the Society: I imagine this is coming back to the old-time practice of having an address of welcome from the Chancellor, or whoever happens to stand in his place. I am glad to be able to stand here and to first bid you welcome. I do not do that in a formal way, because actions speak louder than words, and you know very well that you are welcome. If you had not been welcome here you would not have continued coming year after year as you have done. So, while I bid you welcome here, let it be understood that it is not a formal welcome, but I want to take this as the opportunity for saying some things. And these are not said in a formal way, nor by way of mere compliment; but as I said to one of your officers, I am glad to be able to speak now, for there are some things that I want to say, and have been wanting to say. </seg>
            <seg id="p253">What does it mean to have you here each year? What does it mean for us? It means — and let me assure you that I want to divest what I have to say of everything in the way of com - pliment — it means a good deal to us because we learn, first, who you are. That you do not realize as much, probably, as some of ub do here; you have become so much accustomed to meeting a good many of the professors here that you take it as a matter of course. But go into any other state in the Union almost, and the members of the state horticultural society are, to a large extent, unknown to the professors in the University, simply be - cause the two bodies of men very rarely get together. Second, we learn (and this is even more important than learning who you are) what you think. That is, what men in your line of wor are thinking about and planning. And this is not merely fo the professor of horticulture; of course he is particularly inter ested in your work, just as the professor of mechanics woul be greatly interested in a meeting of the mechanical engineers of the country, but the body of the faculty are interested i knowing who you are and what you are doing. And then, las under this head, it does our studente good. You will not see very many students in each session, but if you were to keep tall at the door you would find that first and last a good man students of the University drop in. I can tell you why the don't come in and stay for two or three hours at a time; the have learned_that they must be at their places. Students ge into the habit on the campus here of keeping time very care fully and very accurately; and that is one reason why they are not in attendance at your meetings more fully. On the other hand, I think I may ask the question, '"What does a meeting here at the University mean for you?" You learn, as men interested in the educational work of the state, what we are doing. That is a good deal. And we are glad to have you know just what we are doing, because it is much better for us that you should know exactly what we are doing, and not what you think we are doing. You learn, also, what we are not doing; and that is a good deal. You find out why we i </seg>
            <seg id="p254">do what we do. Of course, if you say you haven't found out as much as you want to, that may be true, but I don't know whose fault it is; you have the opportunity, at least, as you come here and are with us, of finding out why we are doing what we do. And then, you learn to whom you can apply for help along cer - tain lines of your own work. This year you have called, I think, oh only three or four of us; you have called on Prof. Bruner, on Prof. Emerson, and myself, of those who are at the present time connected with the University. I want just at this point, under this head of your learning to whom you may apply for help along various lines, to make a suggestion. When you hare called on the Horticulturist, the Entomologist and the Botanist, you have by no means touched on all the departments that might be made of use to you. And this without straining any point at all. For example, you might call on the Chemist to help you. Now let me say once for all, that I am not certain it would be best to call on a man every time for a paper; call on him for suggestions, or to pronounce on a certain matter which comes up. Without entering into all that the Chemist might do, here are two or three things: He is able to pass, and tell you how to pass, on the purity of certain things. For example, the purity of vinegar. The chemist will tell you all about that from a chemical standpoint. He can give you means for d&lt; mining the purity or impurity of jelly, which is another matter of much interest to you. The chemist can take up the dis&lt;u&gt; of the purity of insecticides arid all the chemicals used for spray - ing. I have noticed a good many discussions that could have been cleared up very quickly by a few words from the chemist. Second, the Geologist can tell you all about soils, the water In the soil and above the soil. And in this particular case, our own Prof. Barbour can tell you all about windmills, the dm of getting the water up out of the ground and out on the land. Then there is the Meteorologist. You have usually called on him, but this year you skipped him. He can tell you all about the weather. The Zoologist, Dr. Ward, run tell you about the habits of gophers, slugs, squirrels, etc. He could keep you going </seg>
            <seg id="p255">252 a whole half day if you wish, and it would be very interesting and very instructive. Outside of men of this kind, there is the professor of political economy, wHo has never been called on by you to my knowledge. I doubt very much whether you would think of calling the pro - fessor of political economy into a meeting of this kind, yet there are problems connected with your work which could have much light thrown on them by a man who makes it his business to study the relations of population to any particular line of busi - ness. Then there is our irrigation expert, Prof. Stout, who has a better knowledge of the scientific aspect of irrigation, prob - ably, than any other man in the state. He can tell you all about the water supply, the means of measuring this supply, and all that. Then the mechanical engineer, Prof. Richards. I had a little talk with him yesterday, and I rose from that talk with the feeling that you should call on him every year to talk to you. As a matter of fact, the professor of mechanics is closer to yon and should have a more practical relation to you than the botanist. There are all those matters connected with me - chanical contrivances of all sorts. Why, there is materia enough there for a whole session of this society under the dire tion of an expert in these matters. When you come to the di cnssion of the various contrivances used in the drying of fruits many of these, I am confident, you will find could be very a curately made if you had the mechanical principles involved I think it would be a good idea to call in the mechanical exper now and then to get light from a man who has made it his bus ness to understand the mechanical principles underlying these processes. Then we have a number of lawyers who are professors in the law college. Why not call on these men to enlighten you on rights, methods of procedure in case of certain rights, etc.? There would be a chance to get some legal advice gratis — one of the most remarkable things on record. Then the professor of agriculture should not be left out. The relations between horti - culture and agriculture are such that it is a one-sided affair if </seg>
            <seg id="p256">253 you go on and leave him out. Then we have a librarian in this University who is possessed with a great deal of sense, and every organization of this kind is interested in books; in the purchase of books; in the reading of books; in the proper distribution of books on horticulture; and so it would not be a bad thing to call upon Mr. Wyer, our librarian, for hints and suggestions as to local libraries, also suggestions as to the purchase of books. A librarian's business, if he is a proper librarian, is to know how to buy books so as to get the largest number of good books for the smallest outlay of money. You might also call on our Domestic Economist, Miss Bouton, whose line of work and whose study are largely given to the ques - tion of the use of those things that you are growing — hor - ticultural products. And last, there is Prof. Burnett, superin - tendent of farmers' institutes, who may throw some light and get a great deal of help from you in regard to the missionary work possible in the state in the department of horticulture. Just a word here. I have every year had occasion to get out into the state in some out-of-the-way places in my botanizing, and one of the things that this society should do is to send horticultural missionaries into some places where the people are yet wandering in darkness, and haven't any idea as to whether they can grow anything or not. I wish you would send missionaries out into some of these places. I will not indicate just where they are now, because it would be just as well to do that at another time. Here, then, are twelve or more university men and women who can be made to contribute to the work of horticulture in Nebraska. Here are a dozen persons who can in this way be made interested in your work. You know it is a fact that if you ask a man to do a thing for you he will become interested in your work. If you were to call the chemist out for a paper on insecticides, he would become very much more interested in your work. If you were to call on Miss Bouton to tell you about the canning and preserving of fruits, etc., she would become very much more interested. In this way, instead of calling on </seg>
            <seg id="p257">three departments as you have this year, you would enlist the active interest of a dozen or more people. This is not a bid for an opportunity for the professors to go out and make speeches. They all are over-loaded with work. It is simply a suggestion as to how you can interest more men in your work, and you can make them interested by asking them questions which they can, in most cases, answer at least fairly well. Further, let me remind you that in three months the regents will make their annual appropriations to the different depart - ments of the University, and to the experimental station. Your time for showing them what you would like to have them do is just now. Do not wait until after the board meeting or until just a day or two before the board meeting, for then it is too late. Do not say that these regents should know what to do without your prompting them. There are no public servants who always know everything without any prompting. Further - more, the regents are thus constantly beset by other organiza - tions urging their claims. If you do not indicate now, or early, what you think should be done, you need not be surprised to find your interests neglected. If you were in the position of the regents you would act just that way. The greater the pres - sure from any certain side, the greater the probability that those interests will receive attention. The scientific men of the coun - try are alive to this fact, and they keep up a constant clamor for the best possible. You ask why is it that the scientific men in the University get so much recognition? Take my own depart - ment; back of my own personality there stands a great list of men and organizations that I can bring to bear when I want something done in my line. The regents feel the force of that. The various societies to which I belong,. the moral force of all those societies is going to help me to get what I want. Just about the holidays a full dozen or more societies met here along with the State Teachers' Association, every one of them keenly alive to have something done along their line in the University. These organizations are looking out for the interests they have in charge. The Agricultural Society, which meets next week, </seg>
            <seg id="p258">PROCEEDINGS OP ANNUAL MBHTINO. 255 the Stock Breeders' Association, which met only a few weeks ago, keep their interests before the regents by communications and committees. The lawyers and judges look out for the law school, and so on. Now, members of the State Horticultural Society, do not be behind these other organizations. Consult with the men in whose work you are most interested. If things are perfectly satisfactory to you, — they are not to us, — if they are perfectly satisfactory to you, then, of course, things will go on just about as they have been. If they are not, if you want more attention given to certain lines of work, you must get be - hind these and push. Consult, then, with the men in whose work you are most interested, and plan with them for definite work. I say consult with these men and plan with them, because if go ahead and say "do this, do that," possibly a little consultation would have shown at once that the suggestion was not feasible at the present time. So plan for that which ran be done; some definite thing, and then ask for it. And last, do not ask for the earth ; there is not money enough for that; but as an organization I would ask for just a little more than I expected to get; that is my advice to you. I don't do that in managing my own department. But don't ask for the whole earth; you can't get it. Make a reasonable demand after consulting with those whom you are going to back up, and then push that; push it with a good strong committee; ap - point a committee who shall not be merely a committee to go and make a feint and then back off. These are some of the things I wanted to say. I trust you will take them under advisement. You can do much if you want to have anything done, and I know you do want something done. Take hold of it in this way and push it, and I am confident you will gain your point. [Applause.] </seg>
            <seg id="p259">Mr. President: I suppose that everybody is about as full of responsiveness as possible after hearing that address. I was very much impressed. It strikes me that we have been moving in too narrow lines and grooves; I like this idea of branching out. I should like a brand new program. Some years we have the apple, some years the plum, some years the cherry, and then we start in and go over the same ground again. Of course our society is branching out in the forestry department. That ia a matter of overwhelming importance, and as we reach out on this line we should reach out on other lines. We want all the help we can get. I am very thankful, indeed, to hear what Dr. Bessey says. It moves the horizon out wider; the vistas are grander; and as we go on we shall have more room and do more On motion of C. H. Barnard the president was instructed to appoint a committee of five on "Policy of the Society," to whom he president's address, and any other matters which the mem - &gt;ers wished to present, should be referred. The president ap - pointed the following committee: C. H. Barnard, E. P. Stephens, . H. Hadkinson, Peter Youngers, C. S. Harrison. Secretary Barnard presented the following report: Officers and Members of the 8tate Horticultural Society: Once more we meet in annual session to compare notes of successes and failures, and to plan for the betterment of the condition of horticulture in this our home state. We are to be congratulated on the fact that none of our active working members have been removed by death, and so far as I think of now, but two of our life members. Our ex-treasurer, Chris Hartman, and Ex-Governor Alvin Saunders, of Omaha, have been called to their reward.

With the beginning of the year came the work of our legislative committee, which, judged by its fruits, has been one of the marked successes of the year's work. As secretary I was more or less in consultation with the members of this committee, consequently am in a position to know that they faithfully per - formed their work. Our legislative committee should be reim - bursed for time spent and expenses paid in work in which the entire society is interested. The summer meeting, held at Johnson, Nemaha county, will be long remembered as one of the busy sessions, in which local talent took a prominent part, thus helping to make it a very pleasant and profitable time. We were conducted through a number of the best orchards in the vicinity, where we had an opportunity of seeing some forms of insects at their work, and of studying ways and means for the prevention and cure of their ravages, all of which added materially to the effectiveness of the meeting. The summer meeting has come to stay, and we should all put our shoulders to the wheel. At this meeting the proposition of the Hastings people for us to take part in their street fair was accepted, and the sum of f 150, or so much thereof as might be necessary, was voted by the board for the purpose of installing and maintaining a creditable exhibit. THE FALL FEUIT SHOW. At a meeting of the board of directors at Omaha it was de - cided to hold our September fruit show in Omaha provided suitable arrangements could be made with the Greater America Exposition Co. The matter was referred to a committee, which after several attempts effected a fair arrangement. The florists, in the meantime, at the request of the Supt. of Grounds, had already part of their display on the grounds, and had a partial agreement made which they waived in order that our society might hold the September meeting in Omaha. The arrange - ment waa practically that the horticultural society should hold a week's fruit show on the Exposition grounds and give a free fruit day to visitors of the Exposition, the florists to maintain 17 </seg>
            <seg id="p261">to be paid to the horticultural society and $300 to the exhibit- ing florists at the end of the fruit show, which amounts were paid and applied as per contract. The remaining $400 was to have been paid on or before the close of the exposition THE HASTINGS STREET FAIB. The Hastings people had erected two tables 7 feet wide by 48 feet long, which we filled with very handsome, showy fruit. As this was not a competitive exhibit, we used nothing but large showy fruit, and mostly of the fall varieties of the leading kinds the state over. I think I can safely say that at no time in the history of our society have so many people seen our ex- hibit and examined it closely in so short a time as at the Hast- ings street fair, and I think it is the universal verdict that the money was well invested.

The fruit exhibit at a state fair is put up for show, and that alone, while a competitive exhibit must necessarily be a more varied collection and therefore not so showy as large amounts of one kind of highly colored fruit. I am a firm believer in the street fair as a means of giving horticultural information. I believe that in this way the most good can be done to the most people at a minimum cost to the society.

            <seg id="p270">REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON OBITUARIES. Alvin Saunders. Resolved, That in the death of Governor Saunders our society and the state have met with a great loss. Mr. Saonders was an ardent horticulturist, and in his life was embodied much of the history of our state. He was a friend and supporter of the lamented Lincoln, and was the last of the war governors, gratefully acknowledge the impress which he made .on our state and the encouragement he gave to the work of our society. Christian Hartman. We gratefully remember the services which Mr. Hartman ren - dered to our society in the past. Fop years he was our treasurer, and in every way in his power he sought our interest and suc - cess. As one after another of our members thus fall by the way we can but mourn for them as for brothers who have toiled with us for the transformation and enriching of our beloved state. C. 8. Harbison, Chairman, Lewis Henderson, Luke Russell, \s fjirw If wwm IvC. Ex-Governor and Ex-United States Senator Alvin Saunders was a native of Fleming county, Ky., where he was born July 12, 1817. Died November 1, 1899, at his home on Sherman ave - nue, Omaha, at the age of eighty-five years. The death of Governor Saunders removes one of the few sur - vivors whose names are connected with the early history of the middle west. Alvin Saunders was a great lover of horticulture. His father was a farmer. In 1829 Alvin, with his parents, started for the west; located first in Illinois, where he attended school intervals of farm work until 183G, when he removed to Mi </seg>
            <seg id="p271">268 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. Pleasant, then a part of Wisconsin, bat now in Iowa. He was appointed postmaster of Mount Pleasant by President Van Buren, and with other prominent citizens built up the town and surrounding country from a wilderness to highest civilization. While Alvin was a student he took up the law and was ad - mitted to the bar, but never practiced, the field of banking and real estate speculation offering the stronger inducements to a young man at that time. He was largely instrumental in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln for president at the national republican convention held in Chicago in 1860. In March, 1861, he was appointed by Lincoln governor of the Nebraska territory ; was reappointed governor in 1865 for another term- of four years, which duties he performed to the great satisfaction of all. In the early struggles of Nebraska during the Civil War aside from the duty of raising over 3,000 men for the Federa Army (although Nebraska at that time had a population of les than 30,000) Governor Saunders had also to face the necessity of putting down an insurrection of thousands of Indians, whose acts of murder and depredation at that time were the bloodies and most appalling recorded in the history of Nebraska. H successfully performed this task, assuming the entire burden without appealing to the federal government. In 1876 Governo Saunders was elected United States senator for a full term o six years. One of his most important achievements as United States .sen - ator was the correction of the northern boundary of the state, by which he secured over 600,000 acres of additional land for Nebraska. Governor Saunders was one of the earliest and most enthusi - astic advocates of a trans-continental railway, and in his first message to the territorial legislature, in 1861, he said: "A mere glance at the map of the country will convince every intelligent mind that the great Platte valley, which passes through the heart and runs nearly through the entire length of Nebraska, is to become the route of the great central railway that is to </seg>

            <seg id="p274">connect the Atlantic with the Pacific states and territories." When the bill that authorized the organization of a company to bnild the road was passed by congress, Governor Saunders was made one of the incorporators, and his prophecy was ful - filled when construction was actually begun on December 2, As a citizen of Omaha and the state of Nebraska, a charter member of the State Horticultural Society, Governor Saunders had been more intimately connected with many of the most important events of its history. He was chairman of the com - mittee of citizens that secured the location of the Union Pacific bridge across the Missouri. He was also president of the Omaha and Southwestern railroad, and one of the original stockholders of the Omaha Smelter. He was largely instrumental in securing the erection of the Omaha high school building, the gas works, the street railway system, and other great enterprises. More recently he was vice-president of the Trans-Mississippi and In - ternational Exposition Association, and was one of its most en - ergetic promoters. Among the honors in which he always took the greatest pride, however, was his election as a third-class member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion. The members of this class were selected on account of distinguished loyalty to the government during the rebellion, and they comprised lea* than three per cent of the members of the commandery. Governor Saunders was married at Washington in 1856 to Miss Marthenia Barlow, who survives him. His other surviv - ors are a son, Charles L. Saunders, president of the Omaha Real Estate &amp; Trust Co., and a daughter, who is the wife of Major Russell B. Harrison, son of Ex-President Harrison. Hon. Christian Hartman was born in New York city March 7, 1844. Died September 28, 1899, at his residence, Laureville, 3411 Farnani street, Omaha, Neb., after an illness of ten days.

In 1861 he enlisted in Co. D, 1st Nebraska Vol. Inf., of which Gen. Jno. M. Thayer had command. He participated side by side with Gen.

In our immediate vicinity apple trees in orchard were not seriously injured by the winter, though nnrsery stock suffered severely. A great number of our peach trees were killed down, but the hardier varieties are all right, and now bid fair to pro - duce a good crop of peaches next summer if the thermometer does not go lower between now and the first of March than it has done so far. The past season has been the lightest crop of berries, grapes and cherries known in ten years. The tender varieties of grape vines were killed by the winter, and many of the varieties con - sidered hardy were so injured that their growth this year has been only six, eight, or ten inches, when it should have been as many feet. Concords and some other varieties were not injured at all and bore a good crop this year, but grapes were ■ Our apple crop was light, and those we did get were of poor quality. While we shipped in car lots something over a hundred cars of apples out of the county this year, the quality was very poor. The price, however, was good, running for summer apple* from thirty-five to fifty cents, and. for winter apples from fifty to seventy-five cents right at the orchard. A good many were sold at sixty-five to seventy cents on trees. The apple crop this year was worth nearly f 50,000 in the county; we got good prices all the way through. Mr. Harrison: What varieties of peaches have proved h; est in your section? Mr. Christy: That would be pretty hard to tell. You can hardly go into any orchard and find all the trees of any one va - riety killed. One tree will be killed, and the next tree to it, right in the same row, of the same variety, will be all right. Once in a while you will find an orchard entirely killed, but in most cases it is simply a tree here and there, which would seem BRPOBTO FROM KR17IT DI3TRI' </seg>

Mr. Younobbs: Didn't you have Alexander pc»cfcc« on exhi ftion at the summer meeting at Johnson? Mr. Christy : Yes, sir. Distrkt No. 2. Bt K. N. Day, Tkkamah. I have traveled over tke district quite a little and find things somewhat mixed. In some parts of the country the orchards were badly injured by the winter, and in other parts they to have withstood the winter fairly well. In two or three in - stances which I can call to mind the orchards bore as full and complete a crop as I ever saw in the county, while other orchards near by were almost a total failure. I am free to say that I am unable to account for this difference. We do not grow many i&gt;eaches in my district; in fact we have EA made much of an effort in that direction, although on my ace I have had jteaches up until last year for five successive ars. I am fully convinced in my own mind that, with a cart' ful selection of hardy varieties, we can grow peaches as often as three yean out of five in Hurt county, and I know of no rea son why the other counties in that district should not do as well Question: What would you take for hardy varieties? Mr. 1&gt;ay: I should take Mr. Russell's recommendations, think he gave me a list of twelve varieties which he considers hardy. Among them were the Wright, Bailey. Champion, Alex ander, Early Rivers, and several others; the Crosby I think was ■ In cherries, the Early Richmond was fully two-thirds of a crop, hile the English Morello was nearly a full crop.

The Mi .irly in my own vineyard stood just as well as the Concord, and was even less affected, if anything, by the cold weather. Red n berries, which are usually killed much more readily than blacks, stood much better; came through the winter better and bore a better crop. Mr. Marshall: How is the Pocklington grajn'? Mr. Day: The Pocklington stood well; the Niagara killed, all of the white grapes, so far as I know, except the Pocklingi seemed to be badly injured. Qikstiox: Was the Elvira killed? Mh.

The plum trees killed badly. Mr. Yager: Did the Ainericanas kill? Mr. Day: No, sir. The Japanese killed root and branch, the Lombard; I don't see one alive this year in my travels. Mr. Ya&lt;;er: That is our experience in our locality exactly. Mr. Day: I don't think there is a live apricot tree in Burt county. From my experience in apricots and peaches, I would take peaches every time and take chances on their doing v and producing a crop of fruit. District No. 3. By E. Corbix, Grand Island. Twenty-five years ago I helped put out an orchard place. This orchard has a wind-break on three sides of it, last winter a great many of the trees killed. I don't know varieties, but the trees killed down to the ground. Cherry trees killed down also. I had several killed clear d </seg>

I don't know the varieties. All foreign plums, the Lombard and that class of plums, killed down" badly, also 'some of the natives. A jrood many of the grapes were injured. My jjrapes were protected, and the &lt;\&gt;n cord, Worden, Pocklington and those varieties lived through. District No. 5. By G. A. Strand, Mindex. I am not prepared to make a report of the district, all my ob - servations having been near home. The cherry trees in our rchard came through the winter all right and we had a good rop of cherries this year. Our varieties are mainly Early Rich - mond, Large Montmorency, and English Morello. We did not lave any crop of apples at all — only a few summer apples, but le trees came through all right. In my plum orchard I have )e Soto, Pottawattamie, Wolf, Wild Goose, and another plum hich Mr. Youngers called the Robinson. These all stood tht? winter well; even the Wild Goose. We had a good show for trawberries, but the drouth cut them short. Mr Harrison: How about peaches? Mr. Strand: My peach trees were planted in 1897 and liav&lt;&gt; not borne yet. They stood the winter very well. Of course they tjze back somewhat. I think the Elberta trees stood it best ; me of those trees came through in perfect shape.
