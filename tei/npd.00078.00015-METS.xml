            <seg id="p003">NEBRASKA TRACTOR TESTS With the close of the testing season for 1933 came the end of the fourteenth year of tractor tesfing at the University of Nebraska. The numbers of complete tests conducted a|nd re - ported for these years are as follows : 1920 1921 1022 1023 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 19! 3 Total 65 16 6 J2 10 8 12 15 7 16 10 14 12 9J 210 This bulletin summarizes the results of 80 of these tests and includes data on all tractors reported by their manufacturers as on the market January 1, 1934. If a tractor has been tested but is not listed m this bulletin, the reader may safely assume that its manufacture has been discontinued. AH tractors tested are certified by their manufacturers as being stock-model machines, conforming to specifications filed with the application for test. No special or high-test fuels are used. All results shown m reports are' those actually attained m tests and are without corrections or allowances for friction, temperature, altitude, etc. These results are accomplished with the tractor m charge of skilled operators employed by the University. Beginning with 1928 the "one carburetor setting!' was adopted and all results shown on reports of tests made m 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1933 were obtained with the carburetor adjustment remaining unchanged throughout all parts of- the complete test. In determining the highest drawbar and belt ratings permissible under the A. S. |A. E.&gt; and S. A. E. rating code, runs are made at a 100 per cent maximum carburetor setting. All other runs are made! at an "operating setting," which may be 100 per cent, or, as is usually the case, some percentage less than that. The "operat - ing setting" appears m Column 10 of the folded summary sheet. A three-page report of each test is issued soon after the test is completed, and this bulletin is compiled from these re - ports and from the specifications filed with the application for test. Copies of the original three-page reports are {avail - able at 5 cents per report (on one tractor) from the Djepart - ment of Agricultural Engineering, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska. By remitting $1.00 those desiring future reports without delay will receive for one year without further requests or other cost one copy of all reports or bulletins issued, referring to tractor tests; each one will be mailed as soon as possible after its release. </seg>

The inlet valve spring and cage were replaced with a new assembly. Before the official brake tests were run both piston rings stuck in their grooves. The lower ring was broken in removing and was replaced with a new ring; both rings were given slightly more end clearance than they had previously. During the drawbar tests the following repairs and adjustments were made: The caster wheel arm was broken and replaced with a new one. The clutch shift lever broke and was repaired. The fuel line broke off at the car - buretor and was repaired. During the limber-up run a stop clip on the cultivator beam control broke.
