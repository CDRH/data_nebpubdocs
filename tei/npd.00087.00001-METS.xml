Fifty-fiist Annual Report' ! !j.* The following report cov:rs the experimental work conducted by the : Nebraska Agricultural Exper iment Station during the calendar year 1937. i The financial report, found a: the back, covers the fiscal year which ended | July 31, 1937. In general plan this report is similar to those of recent years. *i The contents are arranged according to subject matter, with the exception ;; that substation reports are grouped under the names of the various sub - !| stations. . ' .'. I ¦ - ; An attempt has been made to cite and abstract all published matter re- • . . ¦ 5 latcd to each project 'and to present brief reports of progress. 1 . Crop conditions in Nebraska were on the whole unfavorable again in \ 1937 because of continued drdudi, and emergency work has again absorbed I some of the Station's; research time. On the whole, however, satisfactory ¦j progress in investigative woik has been made. Many of the projects arc ( j " related to regional projects curried on cooperatively by groups of stations. j j ' Several are also cooperative with federal agencies. [ [ AGRiajtTURAL ENGINEERING Tractor tests.—The testing season of 1937 was the eighteenth since the j \ ', Nebraska tractor test 1 law was put into operation. Nineteen were tested ; during the season. Bulletin 313, Nebraska Tractor Tests—l92o-1937, is -.'...''] being published. :) , : ¦ Adaptation of small electric motors,to^^ farm use.—Little has been done on this project recently. A ieon lamp is being studied as a visible indi - cator to the operator that a i notor is drawing full-load current. Important y. features of the mechanism are absence of moving parts, low cost, and i non-tamperability. i ¦ , . &gt;.'.¦ Water heating for livesock.—The warming of drinking water for '.- ¦ milk cows by means of elect :ic soil-heating cable is giving continued satis- . factory results. Records for a 64-day period beginning January 19, 1937, show that Holstejn cows drank 9.82 gallons of warmed water per cow per ;i day. Electricity consumed amounted to a little less than 0.5 kilowatt-hour ' per cow per day. Observations are. being continued. The results of heating drinking water for hogs during one season through a 100-day period beginning November. 6, 1936, indicate that it '.'. is not practical to maintain water temperature higher than that necessary , to prevent freezing. Hogs supplied .with* drinking water at 35" to 40* ¦ F. made as rapid and as ceo lbmical gains as those supplied with drinking } water at; 55 "and 75° F. Observations are being rontinued, I : Methods of cooling nulk on the farm and thdr effect on quality.—The . , ; study of milk cooling by d iffusion of fold air in a "dry" type box has ' ' • been completed. The box hiis been installed on a farm where it is proving : satisfactory. Description: and summary of results are being prepared. ¦¦ !¦ : j Performance of rubber i ires on tractois.—The traction of pneumatic i\ tires was given further study in 1937.

         <seg id="p012">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station bar pull developed with calcium chloride solution in the tire as wheel weight with the drawbar pull developed when cast iron on the axle was used. It was found that equal weights applied to the wheel, whether in the form of liquid in the tire or cast iron on the axle, produced equal traction. Methods of filling and emptying the tires of the calcium chloride solution were also studied. Mechanical equipment for the eradication of bindweed.—This project was again active on a 32-acre field three miles cast of Walton. It will be recalled that clean cultivation was started during the summer of 1934. Twenty-one cultivations were given this field during the remainder of the 1934 season, twenty-four in 1935, and twenty-three during 1936, making a total of sixty-eight cultivations up to the 1937 season. Cultivation was begun as soon as plants appeared. Corn was surface-planted in this field in the spring of 1937 and given four normal cultivations, followed-with some handwork with a hoe and the application of sodium chlorate to the remaining established plants. A large number of bindweed seedlings appeared and were destroyed by cultivation. During the remainder of a comparatively dry summer very few weeds of any kind appeared. The corn crop harvested from this field was estimated to yield 25 bushels per acre. Two new areas of approximately 17 acres each have been laid out on which efforts will be made to determine the practicability of growing a crop and at the same time exterminating this weed pest. In one of these fields all of the weed roots were cut off at an approximate depth of 18 inches in the spring of 1937 and check-row corn was planted. Four normal cultivations were completed with a row-crop tractor and additional cultivations in two directions were made with one-horse culti - vators after the corn was too tall to work with a tractor outfit, and a final cultivation was made with a duck-foot cultivator after the corn had been removed to a silo. Each of the tractor and horse cultivations was followed by handwork with a hoc. The weeds were slow to appear late in the summer. This retarded growth might be due to combined effects of the cultivations and the drouth. The second 17-acre field has been Killefered to a depth of approxi - mately 18 inches in the fall preparatory to a corn crop in 1938 to be handled in the manner described above. A farm cooperator in York county is combating weeds less well estab - lished than diose on the farm near Walton and has been able to get nearly 100 per cent eradication in a noticeably shorter time. For other matter on bindweeds see pages 10 and 21. The adaptability of electric hotbeds to farm use.—Results obtained dur - ing a 79-day period beginning February 1, 1937, indicate that electricity at 2.29 cents per kilowatt-hour compares favorably with kerosene at 13.5 cents per gallon as a source of heat for hotbeds. The average consumption during the period was 1.71 kilowatt-hours per day per 3'x 6' sash. Kero - sene consumption was 0.29 gallon per day per sash. Observations are to be continued. </seg>

Fifty first Annual Report ¦¦•••¦:'¦ i- - ' ¦ ; ' ' 1 Adaptation of insulated electric brooders in uninsulated poultry houses; i —Special-type insulated electric brooders averaged 0.673 kilowatt-hour per ' chick raised during an. B-wa-ks period beginning February 17, 1937. The i brooders were heated with lead-covered soil-heating cable. Economic value of insulation was clearly shown&gt; the saving in one season being more than ! enough to pay for the insula ing material. The work is to be continued. : ¦¦¦;' Methods and equipment for curing and preserving perishable farm 1 products under conditions oE controlled temperature and humidity adapt - \ able to use on the (arm.—Pr:liminary studies of humidity-control methods are under way. The! first priblem is the determination of maximum tem - perature and minimum rela ive humidity suitable for proper preservation of eggs, dressed poultry, and highly perishable fruits and vegetables for short carry-over periods, and for curing cheese. Studies will also be made toward the development of equipment which will be of practical use on ! the farm for the preservatior of perishable farm products under conditions j of controlled temperature ar d humidity. , V / - .¦¦ ¦;.

'¦.;: actively carried on during tlie year covered by this report. The principal 3 effort has consisted in attempts to so attenuate the swine erysipelas bacillus ¦¦ by chemical influences that cultures of the organism may be safely and \, adequately used to secure more active immunity in swine apt to become -. -.

Mo encouraging results have thus far been • obtained and further attempt must be and will be continued. ¦ A proposed method for t lie immunization of swine against hog cholera. '-'. effort has ken devoted to this project since its authoriza - tion in 1936. Most.of this work has consisted of the preparation of the ; vaccine virus in accordance with the original and modified methods pro - posed by the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry. Eight preparations were ¦ made and their value as immunizing agents tested by treating cholera - -1 susceptible pigs with adequs te doses of the material and challenging their immunity by an inoculatior of active hog-cholera virus one month later. I Each test unit consisted of ihree pigs, of which two were treated and the third kept in the same pen is a virus control. ; The experiment largely ;erved the purpose of orientation, although the work thus far indicates that crystal-violet-treated hog-cholera blood has become quite attenuated-a id manifests an immunizing, function when vi injected into test animals.

The safety of the crystal-violet virus is further \k indicated by the fact that thus far none of the susceptible pen mates || (controls) developed cholera prior to the final inoculation with blood virus. j|| Most of the vaccine virus samples had manifest immunizing qualities. Ife Variations were, however, observed without their cause being revealed «| in the limited material under observation. The causes may not be entirely W associated with the vaccine virus. This was evident when one subject be- B5 came solidly immune and the other one succumbed to hog cholera after the II virus blood inoculation. 1,1 In the course of the experiments evidence also came to light which ¦'•. shows that the retention of immunizing value in storage is also subject to | variations. In one case the crystal-violet vaccine protected pigs against | cholera when injected 387 days after its initial preparation. In some others | inadequate or no protection was observed after storages of 37, 117, 135, and % 204 days, in spite of the fact that all were prepared in identical manner; | An effort will be made to throw light on these phenomena by the use | of a larger number of test animals. Age of the test animals will also be | considered. i? In support of whatever results would be obtained from the pen cxperi- * ments it was deemed proper also to apply the crystal-violet virus vaccine | under conditions similar to those prevailing in farm herds of swine. Hence, f fifty pigs in apparent good health and weighing from thirty to forty-five pounds were procured. On June 1. 1937, all these pigs were inoculated each with 5 cc. of crystal-violet virus mixture No. 90122. As anticipated from other results the inoculations caused no disturbance in the health or well being of these fifty subjects. In order to test the immunity status of the herd, four pigs selected at random were placed in one of the pens in our building and on July 6, 1937, each one of the four received an inoculation of 2 cc. of hog cholera virus blood No. 91945. As a result of these inoculations all four subjects promptly developed acute hog cholera and died with this disease. Although the Bacillus suipestiftr was found in the organs of three of these pigs, there was no escape from the conclusion that they had developed no resist - ance to hog cholera infection and that the vaccination had failed. On August 3, 1937, four more pigs, after having been placed in an isolation pen, were injected with 2 cc. of hog cholera virus blood No. 92270. As in the previous experiment all four pigs died of hog cholera, although from only one of the subjects could the Bacillus suipestijerhc recovered. The conclusion was therefore warranted that the whole lot would succumb to hog cholera as a result of the intended contact exposure to cholera - infected swine. The results of the two tests were rather surprising, since a test with crystal-virus mixture No. 90122 made with two larger pigs had shown || it to confer an adequate immunity to these subjects. It is possible that the || age of the yard pigs may have been a factor. In consequence it was deemed T; expedient to repeat the vaccination. This was done on August 17, 1937. I </seg>

A similar test was {applied; to four more pigs taken at random from the ;: yard, and on October. 18, 1937, each one was inoculated with 2 cc. of hog ;ii cholera virus blood No. 93378.

With the tentative assurance that the remaining pigs in the yard had j also, become resistant the (riginally intended exposure test could proceed. I .

Bacteriologic, serojogic and pathologic diagnosis of specimens sub - l mined by veterinarians, fanners, and others.—ln the course of 1937 a total of 6,260 specimens were ex imined and reported on, i AGIICULTORAL CHEMISTRY ; Preparation ami study o£ the cereal glutelins. —Results of the limited ¦ .. ¦ amount of work done on his project in 1937 strongly support a previous suggestion that the flour lipoids are in some manner responsible for I certain baking properties md manifestations that have customarily been attributed exclusively to th: gluten. The main evidence in support of this ;; view has been obtained with flour whose gluten properties were supposedly ;¦ damaged by "overheating.' It has been well established that when flour '.; is heated above 16"0° F." or any considerable period of time its baking i quality is seriously injurec, presumably because of "denaturation" of the jj. gluten. We find, however, that flours so injured by heating at even much ' higher temperatures than 160° F. can be fully "restored" simply by ex - j traction with fat Solvents such as ethyl ether, petroleum ether, acetone, or benzene. Efforts to reich a satisfactory explanation of this behavior •,} have thus far given inconc usive results. It is however certain that the prop - ¦;i erties of the gluten are piofoundly influenced by the nature or character % of the lipoid substances wth which the gluten is associated. . : . ¦ ¦ Enzymes of wheat floir as related to flour grade and baking char - j acteristics.—The starch-arrylase,systems, respectively,!of germinated and :( ungerminated wheat and jarley have received considerable further study.

The nature of herbicidal toxitity.—Additional study of the acid-arsenic spray treatment for eradicating bindweeds has confirmed former conctus- | ions, namely, rhat the treatment has a distinct value when used under j favorable conditions and by trained operators having special equipment. :' j When applied under suitable conditions, it is highly effective in destroying ! the long roots of the weed. The follow-up treatment with cultivating, implements is thereby simplified and the amount of such work necessary f is greatly reduced. ' Physico-chemical studies on the nature of cold resistance in crop plants. —Methods were developed for growing plants under controlled nutrition ; in sand cultures, for "hardening" anci freezing these plants, and for the analysis of plants grown both in sand cultures and in soil. In a study of the influence of nutrients on hardening and cold resistance, adequate data indicate that with winter wheat seedlings, increased cold resistance is induced by a high proportion of monocalcium phosphate in the nutrient solution, by the use of sucrose, glucose, or maltose as a nutrient, and, under the influence of short days, by deficiency of any clement other than phosphorus. Decreased cold resistance may be in - duced by lowering the supply of monocalcium phosphate or by feeding an excess of either ammonium nitrate or magnesium sulfate. No evidence has been found that high levels of potassium increase cold resistance of wheat seedlings grown in sand cultures. In most instances similar con - clusions apply to barley seedlings. Sugar nutrition of wheat seedlings stimu - lates increased cold resistance even in "unhardened" material. The conclusions derived from sand-culture investigations have been ' substantiated with soil-grown material as regards the two nutrients phos - phorus and nitrogen. In an investigation of the influence of carbohydrate storage and re - serves on hardening and cold resistance, seven varieties of winter wheat and several varieties each of winter barley, spring barley, and spring wheat were utilized.

Research Bulletin 94, The Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks, lI — A Comparison of Protein Concentrates from Single and Mul - tiple Sources, by C. W. Ackerson, M. J. Blish, and F. E. Mussehl, October, 1937, 8 pages, reports a study of the retention of the nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus by two lots of chicks fed rations differing in the nature of the protein concentrate. It was found that the rate of gain and the mean net weight of a lot of chicks fed a mixture of meat meal, fish meal, and* dried buttermilk were greater than where a lot was supplied meat meal alone as the concentrate. It was also found that the lot fed the three protein concentrates retained more of the nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus fed than did a similar lot where the concentrate was supplied by meat meal. Research Bulletin 96, The Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks, lII — A Comparison of Calcium and Calcium Sulfate as Sources o\ Calcium, by C. W. Ackerson, M. J. Blish, and F. E. Mussehl, December, 1937, 8 pages, reports a study of the source of calcium.. When fed at a level of 1.5 per cent of the ration, calcium as calcium sulfate and calcium as calcium carbonate were equally effective in supplying the needs of growing chicks. The rate of growth was not affected and the retentions of nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus were not influenced by the source of calcium. Because of the difference in the calcium content of the two salts, it takes 1.75 pounds of calcium sulfate to replace one pound of calcium carbonate in the ration. Research Bulletin 97, The Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks, IV — Meat Meal and Fish Meal Compared with Meat Meal, Fish Meal, and Soybean Meal as Protein Concentrates, by C. W. Ackerson, M. J. Blish, and F. E. Mussehl, February, 1938, 8 pages, reports that the rate of gain (gain in weight divided by the weight of dry matter fed) and the mean net weight of chicks fed a ration containing protein in the form of meat meal and fish meal were not materially different from the rate of gain and mean net weight of chicks which received a comparable ration in which soybean meal was substituted for a third of the meat meal and fish meal content. In each of the two lots about 41 per cent of the nitro - gen fed was retained in the gain. With the base used, a mixture of meat meal, fish meal, and soybean meal satisfactorily replaced a mixture of meat meal and fish meal as the protein concenlrate.

The presence of mastitis in the herd has in - j terfered by making! selectioi of suitable groups of cows of the various j breeds difficult. Further da a will be necessary before definite conclusions ¦_.• can be drawn. Several experiments on the effect of avitaminoses on the lactogenic con - tent of the pituitary glands )f rats, in cooperation with station staff mem-.. ¦ bers in the University of Missouri, have been completed. Vitamin A de - i ficiency, according to indications, does not alter the galactin content of the pituitary gland.

I Data on the vitamin A content of AIV silage, molasses silage, ordin - i\ ary, and soybean silage are low almost ready for publication. -|.. Work on the vitamin V, B, and G content of cheese and condensed milk has been continued. Thus far the work has been confined to the two ; first-named vitamin comple ices. Although definite conclusions cannot be ;j drawn at this time; it apjears that the vitamin.

If eggs are not used a half teaspoonful of gelatin, four or five drops of rennet extract, or junket tablets can be used as stabil - izer. Substitution of cerelose for sucrose to the extent of one-third materially retarded bleeding in sherbets and improved body. Stabilizers have been studied experimentally but the work on sherbets is incomplete and will be continued. Milk quality as influenced by the individual cow.—During the past few years special efforts have been made to control mastitis in the dairy herd. Isolation of infected cows and monthly inspection of every quarter of every udder have been used. The brom thymol blue test, bacterial counts, strep - tococcus and leucocyte counts, and other tests have been used on samples. Progress has been made and plans include continuation of the effort. Factors affecting reproduction in dairy catttlc.—lnfection with tricho - monas has been found and studied in both bulls and cows in the dairy herd. This infection is associated with unsatisfactory breeding. Some work has been done on wheat germ oil and prolan as affecting repro - duction in heifers and cows, and of prolan as affecting bulls. A study of services required for conception, as affected by season and by age of bulls and cows, is nearing completion. Continued microscopic study of semen taken at monthly intervals includes observation on the per - centages of active spermatazoa and on deformations of spermatazoa. Studies on artificial insemination have also been continued. FIELD CROPS AND SOILS Corn improvement, —Favorable progress was made in the develop - ment of new inbred lines and in producing new experimental hybrids to be tested for commercial values in various parts of the state. The neces - sary control pollinations were successfully carried out, because these breed - ing stocks had been planted in a field supplied with supplemental irri - gation. On the other hand, the hybrid and variety corn-yield tests on the Experiment Station farm failed completely because of the severe heat, drouth, and grasshopper injury. There is apparent need for a 20-acrc testing field more favorably situated in the state with respect to rainfall, which would permit duplicate planting of important tests undertaken at Lincoln. Because of four consecutive years of corn failure on the farm at Lincoln due to drouth, it has been impossible to make satisfactory progress in the testing of new experimental hybrids. Fortunately six uniform tests including 35 hybrids and varieties mate - rialized satisfactorily in various parts of eastern Nebraska. These provide, as in other recent years, an opportunity to compare local varieties with the five commercial hybrids certified in Nebraska and a number of other ex - perimental hybrids and several commercial hybrids offered for sale in this state by outside growers. As an average for the tests in six eastern-Nebras- </seg>
         <seg id="p021">[-¦¦-. ; '¦¦'¦- ¦ . ¦ ] Firv-FiRST Annual Report ka counties, the five Nebraska certified hybrids surpassed the grain yield i of the standard Krug variety by 13 per cent. As an average for similar tests during five years, these five hybrids averaged 17 per cent more grain j yield than Krug. With an average acre yield of 395 bushels for Krug, lowa 939 yielded 48.6 bushels, Nebraska 238 47.0 bushels, Nebraska 252 47.0 bushels, Nebraska II) 44.8 bushels, and Nebraska 362 443 bushels. ! Compared with Krug as :00 per cent, these are respective relative yields of 123,119,119,113, and 112 per cent. Enough certified hybrid seed was produced by Nebraska farmers in 1937 to plant a quarter million acres in 1938. It is hoped that the newly developed Nebraska hybrids will serve a wider range of conditions in the state and will make possible the westward expansion of the hybrid acreage. There'is a need for both earlier and later hybrids to supplement those now in use. jA state law was enacted by the last legislature, defining i hybrid seed corn as offered for sale. This should prevent fraudulent prac - -y ticcs of misrepresentation. / .-.¦¦¦¦-. : \ ' Based on experimental data, a distinction is made between the adapta - \ tion of hybrids and open-pollinated varieties. Adaptation of hybrid s corn originating from crossed inbred lines is dependent upon component i"¦'¦ lines and not upon the locality where the seed is produced, as is the case I with open-pollinated varieties. All hybrids are not equally good and they f also differ widely as to vegetative size and number of days required to s; mature. After the local adaptatio'n and superiority of any specific hybrid j have been established through trial, it is possible to procure this same i hybrid with essentially identical characteristics year after year irrespective of where the seed is produced, provided the same parental seed stocks and i proper crossing technique) have beenused. Thus, if the climate and soil ? conditions ate favorable for the production of sound seed, it is immaterial ¦ whether the seed of any specific hybrid is produced in the north or south, and whether on unirrigated or irrigated land. It has been concluded that well preserved seed com may ordinarily [ be expected to germinate and yield satisfactorily up to four years of age. Ear and kernel size may be relatively small in years of severe drouth as in many parts of the state i/J 1937 and-other recent years.

For the last five years Cheyenne has had the highest average yield for varieties in plot tests, very closely followed by Nebraska No. 1063. This Turkey selection had the highest average yield of any variety in the co - operative tests with farmers in 1937. In the special rust nursery, while it developed nearly as much rust as did Cheyenne, it showed an ability to produce fairly good grain under epidemic conditions. It is also resistant to the races of stinking smut or bunt common to Nebraska. Seed has been increased and in 1937 about 70 bushels were harvested. Most of this has been distributed for further increase to farmers in various parts of the state. A selection of Blackhull made in the controlled freezing work yielded very well in plot tests, being distinctly higher than original Black - hull. The selection is much more winterhardy than the parent. In the nursery much progress was made toward the development of a rust-resistant winter wheat. A large number of strains of Hope X Chey - enne and'Hope X Turkey selection (Nebraska No. 1069) were; given pre - liminary nursery tests, and in cooperative work at Manhattan, Kansas, and College Station, Texas, it was shown that many of them are highly resistant to stem rust. These resistant lines are being advanced to yield tests as rapidly as seed is available. For the most part nursery yield data were not satisfactory because of drouth. In the controlled freezing studies more data were obtained indicating that defoliation of field-grown winter - wheat plants reduces their winterhardiness.

Quisenberry, Nebr. Crop Growers' Assn. Ann. Rpt. 28:103-11, 1937. Spring small grains.—The yields of oats in 1937 were much better than in 1936, and again the early and mid-season varieties outyielded the late ones. The highest yields were made by two Texas Red selections, fol - lowed by Columbia. For a 14-year period Nebraska No. 21, a selection of Kherson, has yielded about 5 per cent more than the parent. Of the newer strains grown for shorter periods the best yields have been made by Brunker, Nebraska Burt 529, Nebraska Burt 518, and Trojan. Brunker has weak straw and will lodge under moist conditions. Burt strains are difficult to keep true to type. In cooperative tests with farmers Trojan had the highest average yield, followed by Nebraska Burt 518 and Brunker. Since Nebraska Bun 518 is superior in straw strength and stem-rust resist - ance it will be increased and possibly released. Barley yields in 1937 ranged from 26.7 bushels per acre for Wis - consin No. Yl to 8.7 bushels for Peatland. All barleys, especially the late ones, were severely injured by grasshoppers. Short Comfort, Trebi, and Wisconsin No. 38 all ranked well in yield. For a five-year period. Wis - consin No. iB, Trebi, and Short Comfort have the highest average yields. In cooperative trials in 1937 the very early variety, Flynn, was outstanding </seg>
         <seg id="p023">FiSty-first Annual Report ¦ '¦ in yield, with Spartan second. Both of these varieties have good five-year averages at Lincoln, although they are not the highest in yield. ' Among the. spring wieats Thatcher, Kearney, and Komar were the highest-yielding varieties in 1937. The crop was so late that stem rust became rather heavy on susceptible varieties before harvest, and grass-: hoppers also caused sonic damage. Based on the average yields for the last three years the varieties rank as follows: Thatcher,-Kearney, Komar, and Ceres. Thatcher is .the most rust resistant of (the three but seems somewhat more susceptible to injury from drouth and heat. Komar, while not as rust resistant as '"hatcher, gives promise of jbeing better adapted to the state and in absenie of rust may be expected to outyield Thatcher. Alfalfa improvement—Work with alfalfa is cooperative with the Division of Forage Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agriculture. The standard varieties recommended in, previous reports, including Hard - istaa where bacterial wilt is severe, and the more susceptible varieties Ladak, Grimm, Cossack, and Northern Common, are still considered the leading commercial vari :ties. Controlled hardiness tests conducted re - cently again emphasize the undesirability of alfalfa strains; grown for many generations at a latitude much farther south thin the point at which they are to be planted. Time-of-cutting : tests with four standard varieties, Grimm, Ladak, Hardistan, and Nebraska Common, have brought out the fact that Ladak particularly responds to;time of cutting, being significantly the lowest - yielding variety if all varieties are cut unusually early and the highest - yieldingif all varieties ire cut somewhat later than usual. Ladak also continues to show a decided superiority in the first (jutting, again suggest - ing its advantage in tho.:e areas in Nebraska where one or two cuttings make up the hay crop. I In the breeding progrhm tests for hybrid vigor in crosses between selfed lines have shown a largt increase in yield when desirable combinations are made. Of 60 such Irosses made in 1935 and tested in 1936-37, the best eighteen yielded anjaverage of 28 per cent more than Grimm; these increases ranged from 19 to 40 per cent. Further sudies are in progress bearing on this important point. On the basis of cont oiled tests for bacterial wil: resistance a number of Nebraska selections vere considerably higher iri resistance than any commercial variety now being grown, including Hardistan.

This ii project is in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. [1 Because of drouth, the hay and pasture yield data for sweet-clover k varieties tested during the past three years are incomplete. The results - j are suggestive, although not conclusive. New varieties most productive &gt;l of forage are biennial forms of Melilotus alba, and include lowa Late r- White, Ohio Evergreen, and Madrid White. lowa Late White is a large- :• growing, late-maturing selection of biennial white, showing comparatively !, slow seedling emergence and early plant growth. Ohio Evergreen is char- y acterized by seedling vigor and a maturity distinctly later than other yar- il ieties of biennial white under test. Its lateness of maturity is of value in i prolonging the pasturing season in its second year of growth. The variety s is a result of several years of mass selection of desirable types secured from ¦ roadside plants. Lack of drouth resistance under dry-land conditions is i indicated. Madrid White is a rank-growing variety showing unusual ' seedling vigor, a characteristic of utmost importance under Great Plains j conditions. Its first-year growth is tolerant of frost. Madrid Yellow is a promising variety of M. oflicinalis having vegetative characteristics similar to those of Madrid White. Redfield Yellow (M. suaveolens) produces less forage than the best varieties of biennial white, but is a very desirable j hay type and is very late maturing. It has shown most promise in the central and northern Great Plains. ; Sweet clover shows marked varietal differences in plant-growth reaction to length of day, when grown under greenhouse conditions. From studies ; of response to light it may be possible to determine the latitude to which j a variety is adapted. _ •. ; Studies concerning testing technique show that the rank of varieties as to yield may differ in crops of the first and second years, and that an equal number of first- and second-year crops must be averaged for any given period to obtain a fair comparison of varieties. Sweet-clover var - ieties are found to have widely varying degrees of competitive qualities, the effects of which must be overcome in nursery tests by having plots of a sufficient number of rows to permit the discarding of affected borders in yield determinations.

Other objectives are later maturity, greater seed and forage Jyield, increased growth vigor, freedom from disease, and superior quality of forage. Certain pollination and hybridiza - tion studies are also under way. It is apparent that sufficient variability exists within the domestic varieties and introductions to enable improve - ment of this crop by accepted breeding practices. This project involves . selection, inbreeding, and hybridization. These investigations are carried ! on in the field, laboratory, and greenhouse. The latter has proved indis - pensable. Methods are no v available whereby the biennial habit of sweet dover may be temporarily overcome by the use of artificial light without . changing its heredity. Tc ripen seed of the biennial forms in the field requires two seasons; in the greenhouse under prolonged day length, this is accomplished in less thin three months.

Additional studies are being conducted with 16 introduced and ¦ native forage grasses to determine the most feasible methods of obtaining f plants started from seed in the greenhouse and transplanting these as I spaced plants to the field.

The com included in this test f for comparison produced no grain because of the drouth and severe jj grasshopper damage. Sorghums were equally outstanding in forage pro- | duction. On a green-weight basis (70 per cent moisture), Atlas yielded J 8.97 tons per acre; Leoti Red, 8.84 tons; Waconia Orange, 8.15 tons; and ) Black Amber, 7.72 tons; compared with Krug corn, 2.98 tons. il Supplementing the yield data from the Experiment Station were re- \ suits from twenty-three outlying tests which were conducted in cooperation ¦ with the Extension Service, county Farm Bureaus, and farmers. In 13 of the tests sorghum could be directly compared with com. As an average of these tests Sooner milo yielded 283 and corn 16.2 bushels of grain per acre. Atlas sorgo, with an average for the 23 tests of 1028 tons per acre, ' yielded the most forage. In six tests, where forage yields were taken for corn, Atlas yielded an average of 9.25 tons per acre compared with 3.42 per acre for corn. The test to determine the effect of different dates of planting on the ] yields of certain varieties of sorghum, initiated in 1936, was continued. | Indications are that best stands and maximum grain yields may be ex- 1 pected when planting is delayed until early in June. A rate-of-planting i test, involving four varieties and spacings of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 18 inches j between plants, was run for the first time and should be continued for j several years. , f The effects of five different methods of seedbed preparation and plant- j ing on stand and yield were studied for the second year. One of the | difficult problems of sorghum production is getting satisfactory field germ- j ination and it is hoped that information gained in these studies will help 1 in its solution. Fall or early spring blank listing, to facilitate moisture j conservation and to permit thorough warming of the soil, appears to be a j desirable method of preparing the seedbed for sorghum. If the furrows j are rilled in about the first of May and again thrown out with a loose- j ground lister during the planting operation, in early fune, the desired I effects are usually achieved. j As part of the varietal improvement program, nine varieties were crossed in 18 different combinations in the greenhouse during the winter oi 1936-37. The F, of these crosses was grown in the field during the past ¦ season and the F 2 will be grown in 1938 for selection of promising types. ! As a further part of the improvement program, approximately 3,500 plants j. were selected and inbred. This had the twofold objective of isolating lines j from segregating material, and varietal purification. !

In a six-year test, beginning with 1932, a seed yield has 1 materialized during three years, 1933, 1934, arid 1935. The causes of failure in the other three years were drouth and grasshoppers. As an average for the six years the annual seed yield per acre has been 224 pounds, while the highest annual yield was 711 pounds per acre obtained in 1935. Based on these yields, the crop cannot be recommended. j Flax has been grown during the five years 1933 \o 1937. One of the standard varieties, Linota, has yielded an average of 3 J bushels per acre during this period, which is insufficient to merit recommendation in this : .region. . ..'.;¦ . "¦ . |. - . ¦¦ Jerusalem artichokes hive been strongly promoted in this state during recent years by certain private interests for industrial utilization. Since no &gt;, profitable industrial market exists, and no such market is now in prospect, I this crop cannot be encou raged under present conditions. In 1937, those j I Improved French White irtichokes that were harvested yielded 3.1. tons i of tubers per acre on the Experiment Station farm at Lincoln. During six | years of testing, this standard variety has averaged 43 tons per acre at ;: Lincoln. The cost of production, harvesting, and marketing is regarded f as too high to invite production for marketing at prices which industry J; can afford to pay for processing purposes. j. i Soybeans.— AM varietal and cultural tests of soybeans proved a complete I failure in 1937 because of severe drouth and grasshopper injury. Standard f varieties have averaged 15.4 bushels of; grain per acre during the last I 29 years. This crop has nit proved popular with Nebraska farmers in past p years, and only a few thousand acres are grown in die state. II | Pyrethrum.— The blossoms on this perennial crop arc used as an in- I h secticide. Of an original 1,200 plants started in 1934,1300 plants have sur- J| vived in 1937. There were practically ho blossms in 1937 and no crop 1; materialized. In the four-year period, the yields have consisted of 60 p pouads of blossoms per ai:re in 1935 and 120 pounds in 1936. Since the j hand harvest of the blosscms is expensive, pyrethrum has proved to be an i unprofitable crop under conditions prevailing here. If- Bindweed research.—The bindweed research has been .cooperative with the Division of Cereal Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agri^ culture, since 1936. The experimental field work is being conducted on a badly infested farm near York, Nebraska. . : Comparisons are being made of various control practices, chief emphasis I being placed on clean tillage, the use of sodium chlorate, and various com- I petitive crops. -Investigations begun in 1936 ate being continued and new </seg>
         <seg id="p028">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station studies of a similar nature were begun on additional infested areas in 1937 to measure the effect of seasonal variation on control practices. The changes in root reserves resulting from various control practices were de - termined from chemical analyses of samples taken during the season. The results from the tillage experiments over the two-year period appear to confirm the earlier work done at Lincoln, which indicated that five or six days' growth above ground may be permitted between cultivations without undue restoration of root reserves. Such procedure effects a material saving in the total number of cultivations required for eradica - tion, as compared with a system of tillage in which no growth of plants above ground is permitted. Records over a two-year period (1936-37) of clean cultivation on a 40-acre field near Bradshaw show a cost of $1030 per acre for a total of 32 cultivations. This period of cultivation resulted in about 95 per cent eradication of the original stand of bindweed. . The possibility of using arsenic compounds in weed contrpl either alone or in combination with clean cultivation is also being studied. Some pre - liminary data were obtained on the effect of sodium chlorate on perennial smartweed and leafy spurge. (For other reports on bindweeds, see pages 6 and 10.) Organic matter in soils.—Soil organic matter consists largely of partly decomposed plant residues. The principal substances present in the plant residues are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose and hemi - cellulose are decomposed rapidly when added to the soil, but lignin is decomposed very slowly. It is therefore to be expected that lignin will accumulate in the soil, and that this substance will constitute a large part of the soil organic matter. For the purpose of investigating the nature of the organic matter, fractions of it have been extracted from the soil by means of aqueous solutions of sodium thiosulfate, sulfide, and hydroxide, and alcoholic solu - tions of sodium hydroxide. The latter was found to extract a lignin-like fraction, while very dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide extracted consider - able amounts of a black pigment. Some of the physical and chemical prop - erties of the soil lignin and soil pigment so obtained were compared with those of lignin extracted from corncobs by alcoholic sodium hydroxide. The soil lignin was found to resemble corncob lignin in its solubility in water, acid, alkali, and organic solvents, while the soil pigment exhib - ited a different behavior toward these solvents. The base exchange capacity of the corncob lignin was 20 to 35 milli - equivalcnts per 100 grams; that of the soil lignin was about 250; while that of the soil pigment was 450 to 500 milliequivalents per 100 grams. Since the pigment appears to constitute a large portion of the soil organic matter, it probably contributes substantially to the base exchange capacity of the soil mass, and holds in available form such plant nutrient sub - stances as the calcium, magnesium, potassium, and ammonium ions. The soil lignin also may take part in some degree in these functions. </seg>
         <seg id="p029">Fip'-y-first Annual Report j ¦ .. Acetylation of both tie corncob lignin and the soil' lignin yielded derivatives having a much lower base exchange capacity and higher acetyl content than the original lignin. The acetylation procedure had no effect on the base exchange capa:ity and acetyl content of the soil pigment. Methylation increased t le methoxyl content of the soil lignin arid corn - cob lignin from 2 and 13 tier cent to 18 and 27 per cent, respectively, and lowered their base exchange capacities nearly to zero. It raised the methoxyl content of the soil pigment from 1 to 16 per cent, and lowered its base exchange capacity about one-third. . ; It was concluded from these studies that the soil lignin has been derived from the lignin of plant residues without great change in its funda - mental character, while the black pigment of the soil, if it is derived from lignin at all, is greatly chan »ed in physical properties and chemical behavior. It is well known that aqueous ammonia extracts considerable amounts T of organic matter from soils, and that a part of the extracted material con - -1 sists of a black pigment, ft has been found that the black pigment con - | tent of the organic matter decreases with rising temperature from north I to south across the Great Plains, and also decreases with decreasing pre - ; cipitation from east to west. I Samples from all of tie great soil groups have been leached with ! aqueous ammonia. Every sample yielded a black extract. When diluted, ; the extracts from grassland soils are brown in color, while those from ¦;. podzols, podzolic soils, late rites, and lateritic soils are orange-brown. '. . Preparations of the bla:k pigment have been isolated from a prairie, ; a podzolic, and.a muck soil by extraction with aqueous ammonia, and ¦ are being studied intensive y. Electrometric titration with sodium hydrox - j ide yielded curves, that ir the case of forest and muck soil pigments * showed definite endpoints, but in the case of the prairie soil pigment, the ;¦ endpoint was not definite. : \¦ . The methoxyl content c f all three pigments was low, and could be in - ' creased only slightly by m :thylation with methyl sulfate. Acetylation in - creased the acetyl content of the prairie soil pigment from 13 to 123 per • cent, and in the muck soil jigment from 0.6 to 18.8 per cent. The highest base exchange capacity, in the case of these ammonia-soluble pigments, : was found in the prairie soil pigment, 398 milliequivalents per 100 grams. ¦ The lowest, 256 milliequivalents per 100 grams, was found in the muck ; soil pigment. . . ; . i Commercial fertilizers, manure, and lime.—Some chemical studies have i been made on soil samples taken from the fertility plots at Lincoln after !¦' 16 years of commercial fertilizer,,manure, and lime treatments. For the ; purpose, a simplified metl.od has been devised for the determination of i¦ ¦ base exchange capacity, ex :hangeable cations of the alkali group, and ex - i changeable cations of the alkaline earth group. The alkali group is as - .* sumed to be mainly sodium and potassium, and the alkaline earth group, f calcium and magnesium. 1 .'.)

         <seg id="p030">Nebraska Agricultural Experimemt Station of the manured soils were higher than those of the untreated soils. The difference was statistically significant and was found to be associated with a higher nitrogen content in the manured plots. The greater exchange capacity of the soils of the manured plots may therefore be the result of their greater organic content. Similar comparison between the plots receiving commercial fertilizers and their corresponding untreated plots have not been completed. The results obtained so far indicate that soil samples from the plots receiving sodium nitrate or potassium chloride or both annually for 16 years contain no more exchangeable sodium plus potassium than those from untreated plots. If this is the case, it may be concluded that moderate applications of fertilizers containing sodium or potassium salts may be continued for a considerable number of years without serious detrimental effects on the character of the exchangeable bases, and consequently on the physical condition and tilth of the soil. Soil samples from the plots which have in the course of 16 years re* ceived eight tons of limestone per acre are completely neutralized, while those from plots which have never been limed are approximately two - thirds saturated with bases. Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that manuring has produced changes in the physical properties of the soils of the fertility plots. Samples from the manured plots have been found to have a higher sticky point than the untreated soils; that is, they will scour satisfactorily on the plow at a higher water content. The manured soils require a higher water content to render them plastic, and also to render them too wet to be plastic. Wheat straw at the rate of one ton per acre annually, plowed under in preparation of the seedbed, has apparently had a beneficial effect on the yields of corn and wheat, but has depressed the yield of oats somewhat, as an eight-year average. The four-year average increases in the yields of corn and wheat were greater for the second four years than for the first four. These facts indicate a cumulative beneficial effect of straw on the yields of corn and wheat. Since in farm practice, wheat straw would not usually be spread on land in preparation for oats, the influence of straw on the yield of oats is of no practical importance. It is of interest to note, however, that the detrimental effect on oats during the second four years was less than during the first four years. The favorable effects of superphosphate on the yields of small grain and alfalfa at Lincoln, presented in the Fiftieth Annual Report of the Station, indicated the desirability of testing this fertilizer more extensively. Accord - ingly, twenty-four field tests of treble superphosphate on wheat and alfalfa were initiated in 1937. These tests are in cooperation with farmers in eight counties in southeastern Nebraska. Studies on the solubility of soil phosphorus.—Soluble phosphorus and pH determinations were made on the soil samples taken in 1935 from the rotation plots of Field K. at the Scottsbluff Substation. The results </seg>
         <seg id="p031">; Fifty-first Annual Report ; obtained were compared with those from samples taken at the be - ginning of the rotation experiments in 1912. The pH determinations were made with a Coleioan pH electrometer. Soluble phosphorus was determined by leaching 125 grams of air-dry soil with two liters of solution . buffered to the pH of tb: soil. The buffer solution used was 0.01 nitro - gen to both sodium carbonate and potassium chloride, with sufficient boric ! acid to give the desired jH. A comparison of the pH values indicates I that there have been no Significant changes in pH of the soil during 24 j years of cropping. On the other hand, there have been significant changes in the soluble phosphorus 1 content. Except where applications'of manure ! were made, all the cropp ng systems depleted the soluble phosphorus 60 i to 90 per cent to a depth of five feet. Where 144 tons of manure were applied during 24 years there was a 90 per cent increase in the soluble phosphorus content of the first foot of soil, and a 27 per cent increase in 1 the second foot. An application of 98 tons during the same period gave .¦ an increase of 37 per cent in the first foot of soil and a decrease of 28 per ; cent in the second foot. In the lower depths there was a decrease in both cases, although this decrease was considerably less than found for similar rotations .without manure. Even though the losses of soluble phosphorus ¦ are large, nitrogen is still a limiting factor in crop production on this soil. ¦• This is shown by the high yields obtained when alfalfa occurs in the rota - ; tion. These results, however, do indicate that maintenance of available soil ; phosphorus in this soil should be considered. . 1 Factors affecting permeability of soils to water.—-During 1937, further :¦ ¦ studies were made on the permeability and tilth of alkali claypan soils. \ Two series of encljosed 4x4-fqot plots were started to ascertain the influence | of different rates jof application of calcium chloride, sulfur, and gypsum } on the permeability of these soils to water. The results show that one ton ' of sulfur, one ton of calcium chloride, and three tons of gypsum per acre i : were equally effective in increasing the permeability of the soil to water. I The special subsoiler used to channel the soil between the rows of • ! sugar beets in 1936 was x lightly modified-for use in 1937. This subsoiler • was used on alternate 12 nws of a 15-acre field before the second irrigation. S Small plots were harvested from adjoining subsoiled and nonsubsoiled areas ! of claypan soil, normal scil, and slopes. The use of the subsoiler resulted i in an increase of marketable beets of 2.14 tons per acre on the claypan ) soil, 3.86 tons on the slope;, and 1.13 tons on the normal soil. ¦ Mechanical analysis, maximum water capacity, exchangeable base con - s' tent, and calcium carbonate determinations were made of three depths ) from several of the claypan and normal areas. All the soils were high ; in calcium carbonate. The surface soils in both normal and claypan ¦ areas were saturated with calcium and magnesium. The subsoil of the clay - -: pan areas was 40 to 55 per cent saturated with monovalent bases, while ; ; the subsoil of the normallareas was about 25 per cent saturated with mon- ' ovalent bases. i Relationships between' slope, depth o£ topsoil, and productivity.—ln order to obtain informat on pertinent to soil conservation and land-use I ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦" ¦ ¦ .

Measurements of these | variables were made in more than 200 fields on more than 100 farms in !| Cass county. The yields on undulating land were generally slightly higher than on level upland, and considerably higher than on steeper slopes. A medium thickness of topsoil, 5 to 10 inches, produced slightly higher yields than a deep topsoil, and in many cases produced lower yields } of oats than a thin topsoil. In view of the fact that these are the results jl of but one year's work, in a season in which crops on the more fertile soils !| were apparently at a disadvantage, definite conclusions are not justified. if Revegetation of abandoned land.—ln cooperation with the Division of -\\ Conservation and Survey of the University of Nebraska, a study of the ; j* succession of vegetation on abandoned land was made in Kimball county ¦ V if in 1935. Fields which had been abandoned for periods varying from one j', to more than ten years were located and used for a detailed investigation "j of the character and density of the vegetation. A definite succession of \ vegetation was found to occur. Short-lived grasses occupy the land three j to seven years after abandonment and afford limited grazing value. j Perennial grasses having considerable forage value come in after six to 12 years, and native short-grass species have largely taken possession after 10 to 20 years. Soil type and land-use relationships.—ln connection with the work on revegetation in Kimball county, an area three miles square was selected for a detailed study of soils and land use. The chemical and morphological relationships of the soil profiles were found to be correlated, with the character of the parent mineral and the topographic position, and to have an influence on the use-suitability of the land. Within the area, 87 per cent of the land was or had been under culti - vation, of which nearly one-third had been abandoned for periods varying from one to more than 10 years, and another one-third was in summer fallow, leaving little more than one-third of the plowed land actually in use for crop production. These and other data obtained in the survey in - dicated that the land in the area is suited to cultivated crop production . only in limited areas where the soil conditions are especially favorable. The area as a whole is considered to be suited to the production of live- ' stock more than cash crops.

At Union varietal susceptibility to winter injury has been under further'observation. Initial injury came a few seasons ago and has con - • tinued, favored perhaps by the severe drouth conditions. It has progressed so far that removal of all Stay man trees has seemed -advisable. A few ! Black Twig trees have also been injured beyond recovery. Practically all ; other varieties have escaped injury to any serious degree. The plum orchard : at Union has been entirely abandoned because of the great tree loss. i Orchard culture.—Tli is project as originally outlined has been very ; largely abandoned since lie installation of the irrigation system has pcr - -1 mined water application to practically every tree in the orchard. Cultural effects which may app«r will be simply the cumulative effects due to . treatments given in previ &gt;us years. During the past year all soil treatment i has been the same excejt for a few small mulched areas. Mowing has I been the only measure uied to control grass and weeds.

" 1 The greater amount of water under the mulch was equivalent to 3% &gt; inches—an amount sufficient to supply the needs of the trees for a period ; of three to four weeks.

The roots of!the trees are shown in a series of full-page plates. . | A study of the use and value of supplemental water for orchards' in eastern Nebraska.—The plans followed in the orchard irrigation project at Union are briefly as follows. A pumping plant Capable of delivering approximately three acre inches per. day has been installed on Weeping Water Greek and the waer forced through a steel pipe line leading to the top of the hill and hen along the ridge running north and south near the center of the orchard. Near each tree, generally beneath its branches', a shallow basin for holding water so that penetration is assured has beer constructed. W ngs leading away from this basin serve to direct runoff v rater to the basin' thus preventing all loss of water through that means. When a 3'4-inch rain fell in 24 hours in August, 1937, no water left the orchard area. For .(termite experimei tal areas, several square blocks of 16 trees each were laid out and the suriace brought to one or more definite levels. This was'for {the purpose of s( curing even distribution of jknown quantities of water. Qnly two of thes: areas were completed sufficiently for use this year butf plans are now under way to complete the remainder and utilize them next season.

A publication having ; some connection with this project is the following: "Some Further Observa- ; tions on the Depletion of Subsoil Moisture by Apple Trees," by C. C. Wiggans, Proc. Am. Soc. Hort. Science 34:160-63, 1937. : j Vegetable experiments.—Soil-moisture removal studies with asparagus i have been continued on the loess soils at Omaha and Lincoln. The aspara- j gus has used much more than the equivalent of the total annual rainfall ... \ where the deep loess soil was filled to field capacity to a depth of 20 feet I; by irrigation. A new plantation was established in which irrigation, fer- .k tility, and length of cutting season will be the variables considered. An article entitled, "The Extent and Rate of Soil Moisture Depletion.in Loess Soils by Asparagus and Rhubarb," by H. O. Werner, was published in \ Proc. Am. Soc. Hort. Science 34:456-61, 1937. {¦ A systematic study has been made of two varieties of carrots to deter- ' mine the amount of sugars and carotene present at various stages of growth during the hot growing season at Lincoln and also to determine the effect of storage upon these components. ;, An extensive trial of sweet-corn hybrids of the Golden Bantam type . j. resulted in mean increases in yields from 41 hybrids of 50 per cent at I ¦ Lincoln and 60 per cent at Mitchell above the means from eight strains of regular Golden Bantam. An average yield of 5.8 tons of canning : corn per acre was produced by the 41 hybrids. At Lincoln this high yield : was largely made possible because of the use of six inches of irrigation : water applied at critical periods. Where irrigation was not used the crop . was a failure. Hybrids differed greatly in their heat endurance and sus- j ceptibility to smut. Both smut and ear worm were very serious at Lincoln . ' but at Mitchell ear worms were of much less consequence and smut was almost absent. Variety tests of the most promising varieties of early tomatoes were I conducted in identical replicated plats at Lincoln, North Platte, and . j Omaha. In these tests the North Dakota lines 209, 215, and 216 and Bison ! have given uniformly good results as have also the Penn State Earliana, Denmark, and Lincoln varieties. The midseason and late varieties were . ' of only mediocre value or definitely unsatisfactory. Several new midseason varieties were grown for observation. Irrigation experiments with vegetables.—Frequent one-inch irrigation? ! were applied in comparison with three-inch irrigations one-third as fre quently. The frequent irrigation was found to be distinctly superior for onions but of no appreciable superiority for early potatoes and tomatoes. Soil management experiments with vegetables.—A series of experi- ; mental plots was established to determine the effect of such factors as quality and amount of manure, straw mulching with straw removed or 'j plowed under, and application of nitrates to plots wheer straw was plowed </seg>

In the fall of 1937 an extensive project was set up in Scotts Bluff county to determine the sig-: nificance of various facto s involved in large storage cellars, and work at Alliance was resumed. Results of wound-healing studies are in manuscript form and will be published within a few months. . Nutrition of the potato.—Exploratory work was conducted to determine the relative value of different concentrations and combinations, of nutrient solutions in the growth of potatoes and with several methods of using nutrient solutions. Results of a test of several varieties indicate that tests with controlled photo-period may be used as a very valuable supplement or to replace some field tests to determine the response of different varieties at certain latitudes.

Cultural experiments urith potatoes.—Soil-moisture studies have verified earlier conclusions that where soils were well supplied with soil moisture to a depth of four or fiv: feet good crops of potatoes could be grown in western Nebraska with practically no growing-season rainfall. This was verified by moisture dete minations in the soils of the crop-rotation series at Alliance and with sarrples derived from various farms in northwestern Nebraska. . During the season of 1937 experiments on dry land have also verified results of earlier years cor cerning the importance of deep planting, packing soil after planting if surface soil is relatively dry at that time, and the serious damage resulting to stands in the field as a result of exposing seed pieces to the sun at planting time.

Potato breeding.—Me hods of producing flowers capable of setting seed during the late winter ard early spring in the greenhouse were developed. Approximately 100 crosses were made and some 8,000 seedlings are now approaching maturity in the greenhouse. Field work has consisted of in - creasing lines produced from seeds in the greenhouse the previous winter, in testing several -hundred inbred lines and hybrids from other breeders, and in testing the more recently introduced varieties at various places in the state. Valuable data concerning differences in the seedling lines with regard to drouth endurance were obtained, at Alliance. Heat and tip-burn susceptibility were detemined at Lincoln.

HOME ECONOMICS Gas stoves. —This project has been completed except for some work on an oven which is being studied in detail. The data secured during the past year will be published as a technical bulletin under the title, Further Studies of Selected Types of Domestic Gas Stoves. Station Circular 55, "Selecting Your Gas Stove," by A. E. Baragar, September, 1937, 20 pages, has been published. The material in this cir - cular was based upon the data published in Research Bulletin 86. Briefly, the circular explains what should be considered when buying a stove — price, performance, construction, American Gas Association approval seal, and appearance. Steam pressure cookers.—The data for this project are almost ready for publication. Much of the experimentation has been devoted to design - ing the proper connection from the cooker to the manometer so that true readings could b&gt;" obtained. Gauges have been obtained from several sources and tested. The results show that many gauges used by people in this state are inaccurate in calibration and need checking and in some cases should be replaced. It is possible that some food spoilage may be at - tributed to improper processing because the pressure gauge does not register correctly. Results obtained by Nebraska homemakers in canning with pressure equipment.—A survey of canning methods used by Nebraska women for meat and non-acid vegetables has been summarized. Detailed records of one day's canning of meat have been summarized. The records show that there is a spoilage of meat between two and three per cent and a spoilage o{ non-acid vegetables of between three and four per cent when canned by the pressure cooker. Additional records are being kept of food canned and will be ready for tabulation in the spring of 1938. The mineral and nitrogen metabolism of college women.—Detailed re - cords have been kept of thirteen girls who are doing light housekeeping or living at home. All the food eaten by each girl for one week was weighed and samples were saved for analysis; also all the excreta were col - lected. The material has been made into brown digests, and is now ready to be analyzed for nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and copper. Family life studies.—Three groups of young people of high-school age, a farm group, a small-town group, and a city group, are being studied. Separate analyses are being made for boys and girls. The correlations be - tween home environmental (actors and some aspects of character and per - sonality for the farm group, boys and girls separately, are nearing comple - tion. Some interesting differences between boys and girls of this group are showing up. For example, the boys seem to be much more affected, so far as their personal adjustment is concerned, by the attitude of their parents toward their friends than are the girls. There is a very significant relationship between adjustment score and the degree to which parents </seg>

The boys seem also to be more i: affected by nervousness on the part of the mother than are the girls. On { the other hand, there seems to be little or no relationship between adequacy of personal adjustment and the amount of confiding in the father and demonstrations of affection for the mother in the case of the boys, but for the girls these relationships are significant. . ' A preliminary study connected with this project entitled, "An Analytic ; Study of Self-Reliance," was published in the Journal of Psychology, 5:107 - -18, November, 1937, by L. H. Stott. This study shows that "self-reliance" in young people is not a single unitary trait but that it breaks up into several uncorrelated aspect! each depending upon a particular type of life situation for its developme it and manifestation. i INSECTS^ RODENTS, AND BODS - ' ' ' ' ¦ ' : ¦¦ ' ! \ : Control of rodents and &gt;ther injurious mammals.—ln 1937, the twenty - fifth season of study of tie classification, distribution, habits, economic status, and most effective means of reducing the numbers of the more destructive forms of the m; mmal fauna of the state of Nebraska was com - pleted. The data assembled during this quarter ce itury of study are voluminous, and near the close of the year a begin ling was made to - ¦¦¦ ward the preparation of a report on the mammals of the state covering these studies. This report will be completed as a&gt; monographic technical memoir, yet presented in such a way as to be understandable by the lay - man and useful in the schools of the state. Control of major field crop and other injurious insect pests.—Neither the chinch bug.nor the Hessian-'fly was destructive in Nebraska in 1937. The surmise that chinch bug populations might be sufficient in the eight extreme southeastern Nebraska counties to enable resumption of a study : of chinch-bug barriers, instigated by the chinch-bug population survey made in November of 1936, projved incorrect. While there] were some chinch - bug migrations in Richardson and Nemaha counties in July, these were not sufficient to justify the resumption of barrier studies. Also, as was • surmised in . 1936, the greatly subnormal Hessian-fly population in Nebraska necessitated a continued suspension of the life-history studies on that insect in 1937. A survey made in June, 1937, in cooperation with the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, showed a discoverable infestation to be present only in south - eastern Nebraska, where themaximum infestation was twenty-two per cent of the stems and the a terage only one per cent of the stems, the same as in1936, while the average infestation for the whole of southern Nebras - ka was even less than the 03 per cent of 1936, and reached the lowest general level of any year since survey records of this pest have been kept. No Hessian-fly trouble was reported in the winter-wheat crop sown in die fall of 1937, and damage jy this pest is unlikely in the spring of 1938. Probably a suspension of de Hessian-fly studies will be necessary in 1938, as has been true each season since 1932. </seg>
         <seg id="p042">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station 1 In 1937, as in 1936, much attention was given to the flat-headed apple ' tree borer, the depredations of which upon the fruit, shade, and orna-: mental trees in the state increased markedly over the heavy damage dur - ing the preceding season. During the period from June 20 to the close of July, the beedes of this species did great damage by chewing off the leaves of American elm, pin oak, apple, and to an extent other trees, thus adding defoliation by the beetles to the heavy damage done by the larvae. This defoliation damage reached its height during the last week in June' and the first week in July, and various experiments were conducted on the direct control of the beetles. Among the conclusions reached from these ; experiments were the following: (1) The defoliation damage by beetles of Chrysobothris femorata can be checked materially by the prompt appli - cation of arsenical sprays. Strengths of two pounds of arsenate of lead, or of one and one-half pounds of arsenate of lead with one-half pound of Paris green, to fifty gallons of water, both alone and in combination with pyrethrum and a two per cent summer oil, with two pounds of lime added in all cases, checked damage to the pin oaks on the College of Agriculture quadrangle and elsewhere. (2) Strong sprays of pyrethrum extract will give a quick kill of the beetles, as high as 98 per cent in ten hours, but arc ": expensive. (3) Sprays of three per cent cube resin powder in water at the rate of one pound of the powder to six gallons of water will give a very high kill of the beetles within twelve hours. (4) Sodium fluosilicate dusts used at any strength applicable with safety to the most resistant tree foliage are unsatisfactory, but beetles dusted directly and profusely with the powder arc all dead in eighteen hours. ; No spread of the alfalfa weevil was discovered in 1937 over the area infested in 1936. In fact, the insect could not be found in 1937 in some i fields where it was found in 1936. i Distribution, life history, and means of control of the common Nebraska ; cutworms.—ln 1937, as in 1936, continued investigations have been made - on the life histories, food habits, and distribution of the numerous species j( o( injurious cutworms found in Nebraska. The application of these in- j vestigations toward the working out of better methods of. control has \ been maintained as a major objective. During 1937, additional field col- | lections of larvae have been made, observations made on the larval habits -j and food plants, and a check made on the time of emergence of the adult : moths. Grasshopper control.—Great as was the abundance of grasshoppers in ' Nebraska in 1936, and heavy as was the damage by these pests in that ' season (greater than in any previous year in Nebraska since the pioneer days), it was exceeded in 1937. The summer of 1936, having developed a heavy grasshopper population, was followed by a prolonged warm, dry ." : fall that was ideal for their egg-laying, and the state-wide grasshopper egg survey made in the fall of 1936 showed at the end of October an ; abundance of grasshopper eggs greater than for the same season in any year of which we have a record.

The actual distribution of the federal bait began belatedly in this state the first week in June. Howevk as grasshoppers were hatching in enormous numbers during May, anA many complaints were being received and much crop damage was bJing done before the federal bait was available 1 at least 1.000 tons of bait Were purchased by the farmers themselves and | spread, with telling effect, in the latter part of May, before the first smp - ;' ments of federal bait materials arrived. ¦ # ; The cool, damp weathe'r of early June worked against the effectiveness of the earliest federal bait distribution, but bait spread during the^second half of June and early in July was exceedingly effective. During 1937, over , 16000 tons of bait, dry Weight, or nearly 30,000 tons, wet weight, were used by nearly 78,000 Nebraska farmers, these constituting nearly two - ! thirds of the farmers of thh state. This compares with ess than 3,000 tons of bait used in 1936 by less than one-half as many Nebraska farmers as ; cooperated in the control campaign in 1937. Results from the poisoning campaign were.uniformly!good where it was spread properly ««• undcr favorable weather condition* , ! Various materials have in the past been used as a base m grasshopper i baits but coarse flaked wheat bran has for many years been die standard. I I Scarcity and high cost of Ud bran may make necessary at times the use ' of emergency substitute bfses in grasshopper baits. In 1934 and 1936, he ! federal bait materials furnished Nebraska consisted of good bran for the j bait base, but in 1937 a combination of seventy-five per cent _ot: sawdust and twenty-five per cent of low-grade wheat bran wasl for-1 nished. In 1937, poisored grasshopper baits containing pure flaked wheat bran, sawdust, ard sawdust combined with low-grade bran, were compared with baits containing ground cornstalks and corncobs as a base, both alone and in combination with mill-run bran. The cornstalks and cobs were ground into small part.cles by Tunning them through a hammer-mill. Although a base of seven parts of ground corn - stalks combined with one part of coarse flaked wheat bran proved less effective than a base in wkich pure wheat bran of a good quahty was used - as a base, the cornstalks-bran mixture gave satisfactory results, and it is evident that this mixture could be used to partly replace^ bran when the price of the latter is abnormally high, or the supply is inadequate, without !my s erious loss in efficacy of the bait. In other experiments conducted to check reports of the Effectiveness of magnesium sulphate and sodium fluosilicate as substitutes for arsenicals in grasshopper baits, magnesium sulphate proved to be inadequately effective, and sodtum fluosuicate. at a strength of three per cen by weight proved to be as effective as a five^r cent preparation of the ske material, in a pure cornstalk base.

These data will serve as a basis for recom - mendations for timing spray applications for codling-moth control, in j relation to both normal and abnormal seasons, thus increasing the efficiency j of these applications. The codling-moth population recovered somewhat in 1937 as com - pared to 1936 and 1934. Weather conditions during the winter of 1936-57 were not extremely unfavorable to the hibernating larvae of the codling 'i moth, as is indicated by the fact that only 35 per cent of those under,. '¦ . observation died before May 12. Of the surviving larvae, 57 per cent had j pupated by May 12, and, although pupations continued until June 22, the 3 • bulk of pupations had occurred by May 29. Emergence of spring-brood ¦ ' ¦; moths began on May 22 and continued to July 3. The first egg-laying took ¦ place on May 27, and this continued to Julji3. None of the first-brood eggs observed in the insectary hatched, although larvae were found under i bands in the orchard on June 19. First-brood pupae were found from June 20 to August 12, and first-brood moths emerged from July 3 to August 13. Second-brood eggs were found from July 11 to August 28, and'bf those under observation 71 per cent hatched. Second-brood larvae were found N from July 30 to October 4, and second-brood pupae from August 2 tor September 14. About 50 per cent of the second-brood larvae entered hibernation. Second-brood moths were emerging from August 9 to Sep - tember 28. Eggs of the third brood were deposited from August 13 to September 21, chiefly between August 22 and September 4. The observed hatching period of these eggs extended from August 22 to September 28. Principal biologic factors determining the population level of the up - land game birds of Nebraska*—For the past four years a study has been in progress on the distribution, food supply, parasites both external and internal, natural enemies, and ecological relationships of the bob-white quail, prairie chickens, and sharp-tailed grouse in Nebraska. A similar study of the ring-necked pheasant in Nebraska, covering eight years, is also in progress. It is expected that a report on the fall and early winter food of the sharp-tailed grouse will be issued in 1938, and a rather exten - sive first report on the bob-white quail in Nebraska is also in prepara - tion. This project is being carried on with the cooperation of the Nebraska Game, Forestation, and Parks Commission. i </seg>

UVESTOCK FEEDING I» : In the following sectioi on livestock feeding at^ Lincoln, reference is made to mimeographed progress reports by their numbers. These reports " can be obtained from the Department of Animal Husbandry, College of | Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebiaska, by anyone who wants a detailed report. ¦ ¦ The titles of the reports art the same as the titles of the experiments.

Molasses vs. corn for fattening yearling heifers.—This experiment was ,'. planned to determine to what extent cane molasses can be used as a sub - stitute for high-priced corti. Five lots of yearling heifers were started on feed October 3, 1936, and fed for a period of 134 days. The object was to fatten the cattle so that: 11 received a full feed of either corn or molasses, or a combination of corn and molasses in addition to the base ration of silage, cottonseed cake l'/ 2 pounds daily, and 1/10 pound daily of ground limestone. , ; The results of this single test, while not conclusive in all respects, demonstrate that cane molasses can be used to good advantage in the fatten - ing ration for cattle. Even! when fed in quantities up to 15 pounds per day per head, it had no detrimental effect upon the health of the animal. None of the cattle suffered from scours or other digestive disturbance dur - ing the progress of this trial. _'-'¦ , I i ¦'¦¦ ¦.¦.¦'¦¦.¦-: ¦ -¦'• ¦¦¦;..; ~- V- ¦;" </seg>
         <seg id="p046">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Molasses, even when fed in large quantities, did not cause disccimina- '¦ tions against the carcasses other than as it affected total finish. The fat on the carcasses was just as white in color and apparently as desirable as I the fat produced upon corn. In Lot 1 (molasses 5.6 lbs. per day first 75 days—then 5 lbs. molasses and 11% lbs. corn 59 days) the cost of gain was $3.51 per hundred less than in the corn lot (Lot 3). Feeding 5.6 pounds of molasses instead of 8.86 pounds as in Lot 2, saved $1.24 per hundred pounds of gain and produced within one pound as much total gain. Molasses as fed in Lot 1 over the 134-day test returned a value 102 per cent as great per pound as the corn fed to Lot 3, when based upon re - placement value. The high value for molasses in this case was due to the fact that a large part of the gain made during the first 75 days was made upon silage. This does not take-into account any difference in sale value of the animal. \ , Lot 1 produced the highest grading carcasses of the experiment and the cattle sold for the highest price, or ten cents per hundred higher than Lot 3, the corn-fed lot. In Lot 2 (molasses 10 lbs. per day first 75 days—then full-feed molasses 59 days—no corn) molasses proved to be worth 86 per cent as much as corn during the first 75 days, on a replacement-value basis. During the following 1 59 days, however, its value dropped to 33 per cent that of corn. For the | 134-day experiment, molasses as fed to Lot 2 in this test showed a replace - ment value of 66 per cent that of corn. It should be remembered, however, that this does not take into account the lower selling value because of less finish. ' I The carcasses from the molasses-fed cattle were just as attractive js from j the corn-fed cattle, except for lack of finish. I Though the gains made by Lot 4 (corn 5 lbs. and molasses 5 lbs. first 75 days—then molasses 5 lbs. and corn 9 lbs. 59 days) were quite satis - factory the first 75 days, being but 7 pounds less than Lot 3 (corn), the results the last 59 days indicate that it would have been more profitable to have saved the corn during the first 75 days and used part of. it during the latter part of the test to produce a good finish. The fact that the corn was fed during the fore part rather than the latter part of the trial is essentially the only difference between this lot and Lot 1. This was the least economical of the lots, considering final returns of the series. Lot 1 was noticeably the most economical. The cattle in Lot 4 were fatter, brought more money, and graded higher in the carcass than Lor 2 (all molasses) by virtue of more finish, but because of greater feed cost the net return was less. ! In Lot 5 (no corn or molasses 50 days—then full-feed corn and molasses ! half and half 84 days) molasses proved 84 per cent as valuable as corn j when compared to Lot 3on a replacement-value basis. Considering the | results secured in Lot 1 and the gains during the last 30 to 40 days, it \ appears as though this lot might have been made more profitable by with- I </seg>

(Cattle Pro - gress Report 164.) ¦ Wintering heifer calves on silage and varying amounts of cane molasses, cottonseed cake, and cracked com. —This was a 208-day experiment with heifer calves consisting of two phases—the wintering period of 112 days and the finishing period of 96 days. This test differs from that repotted above in the age o£ the experimental animal, lengthof feeding period, and method of handling. The primary object was to find the optimum amount of molasses that could be used to replace corn in the cattle fatten - ing ration. The rations fed to each lot were as follows: . _: } . Phase I.—Winterinc Period . Lot I—Grainlcss corn.silage plus cottonseed cake (1 pound). Lot 2—Grainlcss corn silage plus cottonseed cake (2 pounds).

Lot 6—Grainlcss corn silage plus cottonseed cake (2 pounds). j Phai e ll.—Finishing Period All lots were continued on silage, and the cottonseed cake was increased to two pounds in all lots. Lot I—Cane molasses (3 pounds), plus full-feed cracked corn. j Lot 2—Cane molasses (5 pounds), plus full-feed cracked corn. I : . Lot 3—Cane molasses (3 poi nds), plus full-feed cracked corn. Lot A —Cane molasses (6 poinds), plus full-feed cracked corn. Lot s—Cane molasses (3 poi nds), plus full-feed cracked corn. ..'Lot'6—Corn molasses (5 poi nds), plus full-feed cracked corn. As in Experiment 164, the use of molasses in this test proved most -valuable when fed in quant ties not over one-third to one-half of the grain ration. Even then, molasses was worth but little more than half the value of. corn per pound. Using molasses in quantities exceeding one-half the grain ration resulted in mo e costly gains than with corn only. This was especially true where the lading period extended over a relatively long period (200 days). When iiie quantity of molasses was held to approxi - mately one-third the grain ration, the replacement value of molasses was not greatly different from that of corn and effected a considerable saving in feed cost at the prices used in this test and at the same time resulted in no difference in the sales value of the cattle. : Molasses did not lower the value of the carcasses in comparison to corn where as much total fat was produced; : </seg>
         <seg id="p048">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station 42 Again this experiment demonstrated the value of some grain feeding during the wintering period with the calf. It is more important to feed some grain from the start to the calf than to the yearling. Cottonseed cake fed at the two-pound instead of the one-pound level resulted in larger, more economical gains and fatter cattle. The extra pound of cake was more valuable than either three pounds or six pounds of molasses when fed during the wintering period. Corn molasses did not prove as palatable or desirable to replace corn as cane molasses. While the corn molasses saved a little more corn than cane molasses, the latter produced 1.84 pounds daily gain and corn molasses 1.82 pounds. The cane-molasses-fed cattle sold for more money and netted approximately one-third more profit than the corn-molasses-fed cattle. (Cattle Progress Report 165.)

Cane molasses in silage-and-alfalfa-hay lamb-fattening rations.—ln the j fall of 1936 cane molasses was fed as a substitute for high-priced corn, to fattening lambs. Some of the rations contained drouth corn silage as the j roughage while others had alfalfa meal. A ration of alfalfa meal and j molasses half-and-half failed to produce a sufficient finish. This same j mixture in addition to one-half pound of shelled corn daily per lamb was j fed to another lot of lambs. In this ration 78 pounds o£ corn saved 100 pounds of alfalfa meal and 100 pounds of molasses in producing 100 pounds of gain. A ration of cane molasses, cottonseed meal, corn silage, and bone meal failed to produce a sufficient finish. As cane molasses made up a smaller '. portion of the concentrates fed in a silage ration, the daily gains were increased and the cost of gains decreased. The color of the carcasses of all the lots was the same. There was no means of identifying the carcasses from the molasses-fed lambs, and the packers made no discrimination. Short-tailed Hampshire sheep.—The first crop of inbred lambs from ; the short-tailed Hampshire ram, U. N. 350, were dropped in the spring of 1937. They were the result of mating U. N. 350 to eight of his daughters, j all with normal tails. Eight ram and 4 ewe \ambs were dropped. The tail lengths of the lambs ranged from 6.5 to 8.5 inches, with an average j of 7.2.

Evidence accumulates that the rate of solubility of the calcium carrier is an important factor. Dolomite is &lt;a-very widely distributed product consisting chiefly of a mixture of calcium and ma mesium carbonates. The calcium in dolomite is less soluble than in the high-calcium limestones. The growth-promoting values of high-calcium and dolomitic limestones, as compared in two ex - periments, indicated a slighv advantage in favor of the less soluble source of calcium when adjustments were made to provide the same calcium level in both rations. ¦ ¦'¦¦:.'. : The addition of 0.515 per cent of magnesium to a specific ration was well tolerated when the magnesium was supplied as dolomitic limestone. When the same amount of magnesium was added in the form of chem - ically pure magnesium carbonate, however, the growth rate of turkeys was significantly depressed. The hypothesis which may.be offered in ex - planation is that the magnesium in the dolomite reduces the solubility rate of the limestone, which is physiologically desirable. The most favorable calcium level, when limestone is used as the source of calcium to supplement a standard formula (No.'B-TS), was found to be provided with 2 per cent of limestone. The calcium level of the basal ration (No. 8-TS) was found to be 1.62 per cent and the phosphorus levels was 0.8 per cent..

I and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. A farm management survey | was made in two soil-demonstration areas—one in Boone county and one s in Otoe county —and a soil conservation camp area in Gage county during j the months of July and August, 1936. Information was obtained for the f purpose of studying the economics of soil-conservation practices. This } survey was repeated during March and April, 1937. During the survey }¦ account books were placed with the farmers cooperating in the study in i order to aid them in keeping an exact record of their business activities A during the year. These books will be collected early in 1938. The num- ¦ ber of farms in each area varies from 80 to 160. Because of the necessity of having several records before any definite V statement can be made regarding economics of soil conservation, it is if planned to continue this study over a period of years.

Detailed studies of soil, land classification, land use, and farm organiza- &gt;j$ tion.—This project was continued from the previous year under the same ' :|| cooperative arrangement is for the project reviewed above. The survey undertaken in Furnas county in 1936 has been completed, the results sum- "•%'¦ marized, and a prelimina'ry report issued in.mimeographed form. The ;-;'|! study indicated that a considerable percentage of the land was in question- ; able use, that more effective conservation practices should be introduced, ¦! that many of the farms were apparently too small to constitute economic -Ja units, and that there was considerable inequality in the assessment of land :..&gt;| for taxation purposes and in the distribution of tax-derived moneys.

Precipitation for the year was 30 per cent below normal, and the accumulated deficit for a seven-year period has reached a total of 26.8 inches or 21 per cent below normal. Dry-land crops and tillage.—ln this work the first year of differential results were secured on the new project. On account of the short moisture supply, all yields were low or complete failures. Seedbeds were too dry in the fall for the germination of winter wheat and rye, and no stands were secured. Spring-seeded grains made some response to differential tillage and previous cropping. The performance of barley is typical. Its average yield after small grain was] 0.7 bushel, after corn 6.1 bushels, and after fallow" 18.1 bushels per acre] Corn failed to produce grain on all prepara - tions except 2.5 bushels in triple-spaced rows, and 75 bushels after fallow. Potatoes produced 29.8 bushels after wheat, 40.5 bushels after corn,, and 88.6 bushels after fallow, j , Pump irrigation.—The main crops irrigated on the Substation in 1937 were corn and sorgo for ensilage. In addition, smaller experimental areas of potatoes, corn, alfalfa, and grasses were irrigated. The ensilage crops were seeded in thick stands; the subsoil was dry and temperatures high. Under these conditions, the needior supplemental moisture developed early and some areas were damaged beyond complete recovery before water could be applied. As a result, yields were low and the irrigation cost per crop unit unusually high. Fixed costs amounted to $1.78 per acre and operating costs 31.57 cents per acre inch of water pumped. Irrigation costs for corn producing 63 tonsjof ensilage per acre were f 1.05 per ton. For sorgo producing 8.8 tons per acre, the irrigation cost was 91 cents per ton. For potatoes producing 412 bushels per acre, the irrigation cost was | 4.6 cents per bushel. 1 \ ! Crop varieties.—Brunker with a yield of 18.6 bushels on cropped land ! was the high-yielding oat variety. This yield exceeded the average of ; all 21 varieties by 53 bushels per acre. North Platte No. 1 with 11.2 - bushels was the highest-yielding of 16 varieties of barley. Ceres was the ; highest-producing spring wheat variety for the seventh time in ten years. ; Early Kalo again made the [highest yield of grain sorghum varieties with 26.4 bushels per acre on fallow and 5.6 bushels on corn ground. Its grain yield on fallowwas four times the grain yield of corn. Forestry and horticulture.—Selection work with Chinese elms has been continued. Several thousand seedlings from superior strains are under observation. David Zelkova is a promising new hardy tree secured through 1 the U. S- Division of Plantl Introduction. The Substation is cooperating with the U. S. Horticultural Field Station at Cheyenne in the testing of hardy shrubs. Native shrubs under observation include a promising large fruited chokecherry. ¦ ¦'¦"' Bulletin 310 (North Platte Series No. 41), Trees, Shrubs and Vines at the North Platte Experimental Substation, by H.

Lawns.—Buffalo and blue grama grasses are being tried out for lawn purposes, and appear promising where the water supply is restricted. Various chemicals are being tried for the control of grubs in bluegrass lawns. Feeding steers on native pasture.—This work was continued through the founh season with satisfactory results. Bulletin 307 (North Platte Series No. 40), The Use of Native Grass in Producing Finished Cattle, by Marvel L. Baker, June, 1937, 16 pages, reports results for three years. The economy of pasture feeding is shown to depend upon the price of grain in com - parison with alfalfa and native grass, and upon the time it is desired to market the finished cattle. Feeding steers on alfalfa pasture. —Three years' work on this project have been completed, and the results are being prepared for publication. Rations for calves.—Three mimeographed repoits were made avail - able during the past year, covering three tests. 1 Brief summaries follow: Five lots of 390-pound steer calves were fed for 100 days on a basal ration of silage and 1.0 pound of cottonseed meal plus 0.1 pound of ground limestone per head daily. In addition to the basal ration, approxi - mately 3.0 pounds of ground corn, ground barley, ground rye, dried beet pulp, and cane molasses per head daily were fed to the five lots respectively. Fed at this level, ground rye, ground barley, and dried beet pulp were as efficient as ground corn and produced as rapid gains. The steers fed cane molasses made practically as rapid gains as the steers fed ground corn, but consumed more silage and required approximately 17 per cent more silage per unit of gain. Five lots of 350-pound calves were fed for 133 days on the following rations to which were added a limited amount of ground rye and beet pulp during the last 49 days of the period. Lot I—Alfalfa hay, full-fed: Mlajic, full-fed; cottonseed meal '/j pound per head daily- Lot 2 —Alfalfa hay, full-fccl; .silage, approximately V\ as much fed as the amount consumed by Lot 1.

In a 140-day test, five lots Df short-yearling steers were fed a basal ration of alfalfa hay. The check lot was fed ground corn in addition to the basal ration. The addition of 2.61 pounds of cane molasses per head daily to the check ration resulted in increased corn consumption and in increased gains. In this comparison, each ton of cane molasses replaced approximately , 13 bushels of corn and 380 pounds of alfalfa hay. | The addition of kn average of 5.18 pounds of cane molasses per head : daily to the check ration resulted in slightly increased gains. In this com - ; parison, each ton of cane me lasses replaced approximately 13.7 bushels of corn and 72 pounds of alfalfa hay. Beet molasses (not the special-process molasses frequently known as "Johnstown molasses") and cane molasses as fed in this trial were of ap - proximately equal value. Cane molasses fed as the only concentrate with alfalfa hay was not satisfactory in any way. -¦•. . The development of breeding cattle.—Mimeographed Report No. 13 is a preliminary report on this project. ¦¦ - In a long-time test with Hereford heifer calves beginning in November, 1933, prairie hay was fed as the basal winter ration to four lots of heifers. The four lots were grazed together in summer on native grass pasture. Lot 1 was fed the basal ration only. Lot 2 was fed 1.0 pound of cottonseed cake per head daily during the first winter period in addition to the basal ration. Lot 3 was fed 1.0 piund of cottonseed cake per head daily each winter and Lot 4 was giveri access to steamed bone meal. The heifers dropped their first calves as three-year-olds in 1936 and their second calves in 1937. "¦":"¦ - ; The feeding of cake du: ing the first winter only was not justified as judged by the weight of die mature cows, the birth weight or the wean - ing weight of calves. The feeding of cake each winter resulted in heavier calves at birth and at weanirg and in heavier mature cows. The feeding of steamed bone meal was apparently of some value but'results were con - sidered inconclusive. I ; ! Poultry.—The Nebraska flock-testing project was continued in coopera - tion with the Station and Ex ension Service at Lincoln.; Dairy.—The Holstein dairy herd was grazed on alfalfa pasture for the fourth year with satisfactory results. A 365-day record of 1,005 pounds of fat was completed during the year by NP Becky Bleske Piebe Ormsby. This cow was bred in the Substation herd, and is the fourth cow of that herd to produce above 1,000 pounds of fat in one year.

Generally speaking, the weather Jf conditions throughout the growing season were favorable to crops. \S Crop rotations.—ln 1937 four rotations were added to study applications j•§ of commercial phosphate fertilizer. The original rotations, concerned with '|1 % alfalfa and manure, have been continued since 1912 and rotations includ- !i| ing pastured sweet clover have been continued since 1920. The differences jii in yield, as influenced by manure and alfalfa in the older rotations, were ,| essentially the same for the year 1937 as for the 20-year average from 1918 .: | to 1937. Manure in rotations has improved sugar beet yields more than has ;| alfalfa, while alfalfa in rotations has increased yields of potatoes and oats if more than has manure. The two treatments, alfalfa and manure, when 1 § used in rotations have stimulated yields more than any other treatment. i;S The two treatments have increased sugar beet yields 9.4 tons per acre, jj potatoes 145.9 bushels, and oats 33.5 bushels, as a 20-year average. ij Pastured sweet clover has increased yields of beets 7.0 tons per acre | as an 18-year average, and oats 17.7 bushels.

         <seg id="p065">Fifty-Jpirst Annual Report crop for potatoes, which are planted late.- In rotationsj containing sweet clover, followed by potatoes and then followed by beets, the yields of potatoes over 12 years have averaged 271.4 bushels and sugar beets 16.7 tons per acre. ' . : Immediate and residual effects of different quantities of manure applied to plots continuously cropped to sugar beets.—The tests were begun in 1926 and continuously cropped to sugar beets with the exception of 1936, when potatoes were grown. In one series applications were 30 tons but varied in distribution froir an initial'application of the 30 tons to a distribution of 6 tons each year over a five-year period. In an - other series applications hav: been the same each year but have varied from 6to 30 tons, with total; of 30 to 150 tons in the five-year period be - ginning in 1926. In the first-named series, with total amounts the same but varying in annual application, the 10-year yields have not differed significantly. In the other siries the 10-year mean yields have increased with increases in manure—from 13.9 tons of beets per acre for the 30-ton application to 19 tons for the'application of 150 tons of manure. The same was true with the yields of potatoes in 1936. The residual effect is pro - portionate to the amount applied. Winter planting test with sugar beets and garden vegetables.— During the winter of 1936-37 the first planting was made November 20 and the second, February 12. Planting was impossible during the interval because of soil and climatic conditions. The highest yields were obtained from the following dates: peas, April 8; carrots, February 28; parsnips, March 18; onions, April 8. There were no significant differences in yields of sugar beets from the various plantings. Lamb feeding. —Ten lots of lambs were used in a trial ending in March, 1937. Soybean meal resulted in faster gains per lamb than did the cottonseed meal in a ration including shelled corn, barley, dried pulp, alfalfa, and beet tops. Beet molasses was 90 per cent as valuable as cane molasses, pound for pound. The lot fed cull'beans and dried pulp with alfalfa produced the cheapest gains, at a cost of (4.87 per hundred pounds. Dairy feeding trial. —Two lots of five cows each, with feeds reversed ' every thirty days, were used in a comparison of beet tops and alfalfa. Results show that the milk yield was increased about three pounds per, head daily when tops, at die rate of two-thirds to three-fourths of the alfalfa hay, were fed. On a dry-matter basis.beet tops were 90 per cent as valuable, as alfalfa, and combined with alfalfa were more palatable than alfalfa alone. No bad flavors in the milk occurred provided the cows had access to the tops only during the first three or four hours after milking.

The v| total winter and summer gains for cottonseed cake, soybean oil meal, and jii tankage were 380, 400, and 397 pounds. The winter gain in the cotton- l| seed cake lot was less in this test than the average of three former years' ¦ j«j work. The calves fed tankage consumed one pound more hay per day . jl than the others. ji The project on the effect of winter ration and management on the jf development and reproduction of range heifers was closed with the wean- j| ing of the second crop of calves. The test has demonstrated the value of j| feeding cottonseed cake the first winter to heifers which are to be bred |i» as yearlings. Heifers which received no supplement the first winter but rj did the second were only 38 pounds lighter than those which received sup- jl plement the first winter and 98 pounds lighter than heifers fed supplements j| each of the three winters. ;| Most noticeable was the number of heifers failing to febreed in the If lot which received only prairie hay the first winter. Thirty-six per cent |!j were dry the second calving season, compared with the 10 per cent in the j| lot which was fed cottonseed cake the first winter. . j« A lot wintered on the summer range instead of in a corral and fed j f cake plus what hay they would clean up had a 100 per cent calf crop each \ season. All of the heifers calved on the range during May and June, which i 1 may account for the close birth weight of the calves in the four lots. How- '! ever, calves from heifers wintered with cottonseed cake gained one-fourth U pound more per day than those from heifers wintered on prairie hay alone, j ¦ ji r </seg>

V : I ..¦'¦¦¦¦ FiftV|-first Annual Report 1 | Poultry.—The flock-testing project, designed to show variations in | flocks of turkeys, was repeated with 100 eggs from each of eight flocks, •| two of which were included in the previous test. In general the results I corresponded with those of last year, with the exception that hatchability I and livability were better. There was a definite correlation between hatch - ;| ability and livability for the first eight weeks. U The difference in the average dressed weight of toms by lot was only | 1.9 pounds and of hens 1.2 (pounds, compared with 2.11 and 1.15 in the if previous test. .; ¦ I There appeared to be no] correlation between the weight of the poults ¦j when eight weeks old and their dressed weight. The lots that dressed out I the lightest graded the highest per cent of prime birds, the difference being s| 17 points. .¦ ' § The hens graded 15 per cent more prime birds than did the toms. M With die exception of two hts, the length of breast bone showed a close | correlation to weight for toms but not for hens. However, the difference I between the average length of breast among the lots was only 0.23 inch for H toms and 0.49 inch for hensj. •"'.,. The tests would indicate that genetically there is not the difference be - % tween flocks that is usually supposed. ;| Dual-purpose cattle.—Progress with this project has been retarded be - |; cause of the small number of) producing females. The six Red Polled cows I; averaged 5,631.6 pounds of |milk and 2403 pounds of fat and the five I milking Shorthorn cows 6,394.7 pounds of milk and 258.9 pounds of fat. | Two of the Shorthorns produced over 300 pounds of fat. ;| Shelter belt.—ln the older plantings trees continued to die from drouth. | There was a heavy loss in the 1936 plantings, the greatest damage being to | the Jackpine. : . ' ¦¦ \ | Water level investigation.—-The series of six years with subnormal I rainfall has had a telling effect on the water level of the subirrigated | meadows of the sandhills. The June level in seven surface wells for 1937 I averaged 21 inches lower than for the five-year period 1925 to 1929, in - | elusive. This condition has resulted not only in reduced vegetative growth | but more seriously in the reduced stand of grasses and clovers. Red and alsike clovers on many meadows have completely disappeared. BOX BUTTE EXPERIMENTAL FARM Under the agreement made in 1930 when the Box Butte Experimental Farm was established, the physical plant is owned by Boxjßutte county and the University maintains the property and conducts the experimental work. The farm consists of 160 acres, located about, five miles northwest: of Alliance. Dry-land studies, with potatoes as the major crop, are carried on. All crops in 1937 were severely affected by drouth. A potato breed - ing plot, in which a large number of new crosses and seedlings were tested, -was an important addition to the work in 1937. Other work includes time and depth of plowing, cultural treatments before planting, time of ¦-¦¦¦:. '".•¦ I ¦•.¦'.. ¦ ¦ ¦ ' i '' ¦ ¦ ; ¦¦'¦¦¦ ' ¦¦"{.'¦¦ '&#132;: •' '•¦ - . ¦' ¦ </seg>

Studies of potato diseases were continued. Test Ml plots ot winter wheat, spring grains, corn, soybeans, and artichokes were l| either very low in yield or abandoned because of drouth. Several varieties 1| of sorghums showed promise in drouth resistance. Ornamental and forest || plantings were enlarged and the belt of trees planted earlier was subjected ff to thinning as a means of combating drouth. p ADDITIONAL LANDS, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT 1 No additional land has been made available to the Experiment Station j§; iii recent years. During the past year an irrigation pumping plant was is established on the fruit farm at Union. Water is obtained from Weeping ;?U| Water Creek and is distributed to trees through pipes and ditches. This iljj equipment will permit the study of water requirements of trees as well as -A the economy of orchard irrigation. The approximate cost of this equip- .|i| ment was $5,000. At Lincoln a deep well was installed for the purpose i]| of irrigating trees at a cost of $610.00. For work with vegetables a water- ,l| ing system was installed to take care of additional experimental plots. MJ Cold storage equipment for potatoes was also installed in the greenhouse. ;| PUBLICATIONS OF THE CALENDAR YEAR 1937 if ANNUAL REPORT il Fiftieth Annual Report, presented lo the Governor February 1, 1937. 1,500 copies. .1 BULLETINS ; No. 305, Effects of Age, Size, anil Source of Seed on the Corn Crop.
