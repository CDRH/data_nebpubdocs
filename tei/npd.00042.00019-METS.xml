            <seg id="p003">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 383 HOSPITAL FOR TUBERCULOUS, KEARNEY, NEBRASKA To his Excellency, Honorable Keith Neville, Governor, and to the Honorable Members of the Board of Commit - mi*#timert of State Institutions, Henry (lerdcx, Silas A. Holcomb, and Eugene (). Mai/field. Gentlemen: I herewith present the fourth biennial report of the Hospital for Tuberculous for the two years ending Novem - ber 30, 1918. Dr. L. S. B. Robinson who became super - intendent January 14, 1916, severed his connection with this institution on June 1, 1918, and I succeeded him at that time. From his report for the year ending November 30, 1917, I find that the following things were accomplished during that year. The new hospital building was equipped and occupied. It was found, after occupying it, that the building was one in which sound carried readily. For this reason a cork carpet was laid in the main hall of the building, a number of swinging doors were installed, and the elevator shaft was enclosed within solid walls. These things have been partially successful in reducing noise. A book case was built in the library room at the same time. Three acres adjoining the hospital grounds on the east, with a ten-room house and barn, were purchased. The house and barn were given some needed repairs and painted. This house furnishes living quarters for the nurses, most of the unmarried lady employees, the steward, and his wife, who serves as housekeeper for this building. A large modern washing machine was installed in the laundry. Cement walks were laid connecting the Hospital building to the Stone building and Pavilion on the west, and the Green cottage and laundry on the east. Steam mains were laid running to the Pavilion, Green cottage and Stone building. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF 384 Since I came to the institution on June 1, 1918, a new well has been dug, and the water system, provided for by the last session of the legislature, has been installed, and is now almost ready for use. This will give us a much more dependable and efficient system and one that will provide fire protection, in case of necessity. We have recently, at an expense of about $500.00 re - modeled the second floor of the Pavilion, so as to accomo - date fifteen ambulatory patients, bringing the tota? capacity of the institution up to 108. The plaster in the Green cottage was in such very poor shape, that it became necessary to replaster. This has been done and the interior is much improved as a result. There were two new bathtubs installed in the cottage at this time. A new three-fire, three-oven, John Van range has been purchased for our general kitchen. Our old one was too small, and in addition was beyond repair. We obtained a mangle for our laundry, which was pre - viously in the Orthopedic Hospital at Lincoln. This was overhauled and put in first-class condition by the American Laundry and Machinery Company, and is giving us good service for this type of mangle, and is all that we shall need in this line for several years to come. A dry tumbler has been purchased and will soon be installed. Ordinary repairs, painting and other such work has re - ceived its due share of attention. This has been done as a whole by a man employed by the month, and has resulted in considerable improvement in the looks and usefulness of the hospital. The roads about the grounds have been given some attention, namely, grading, cindering and dragging. Due to the increased cost of pipe and other supplies, our new water system cost us so much that there was no balance remaining in our special appropriation with which to purchase a Roentger ray outfit, nor was a separate resi - dence provided for the superintendent. A septic tank was built and connected with our sewage system last fall. This tank is on land purchased for the </seg>
            <seg id="p005">THE BOARD OK COMMISSIONERS purpose about an eighth of a mile from the institution grounds, and located on the tail race of the power com - pany's canal. A Reo truck was purchased for the institution in April, and has been used daily since. It has been a great conveni - ence and has provided a good means for hauling all sup - plies needed at the institution. The truck, dry tumbler, mangle, etc., have been purchased out of the institution cash fund. This institution was established primarily for incipient cases of tuberculosis. I regret to say that the majority of the cases v.e receive are not incipient. We should have more incipient cases. Apparently this institution is not sufficiently well known throughout the state, or we would get more of the kind of cases that we should have, to get the desired number of cures. The people of the state must be brought to realize that tuberculosis, if taken early, can be cured, and they should also be informed of the existence of this institution. It is my recommendation that some com - prehensive scheme of publicity be formulated and carried into action, thus increasing the institution's usefulness. It is a surprising fact that nearly half of the counties in this state, forty-three to be exact, have not sent a patient to this institution in the past two years. The following twenty - three counties have never sent a patient to this institution — Antelope. Banner, Blaine, Boyd, Brown, Deuel, Dundy, Grant, Greeley, Hooker, Keith, Logan, Loup, Morrill, Nance, Perkins, Rock. Sarpy, Sioux, Thomas, Wayne, Wheeler and York. And there are twenty-one counties which have sent but one patient here since this institution was established. They are listed as follows: Boone, Box Butte, Cherry, Cheyenne, Dakota. Dawes, Dixon, Garden, Gosper, Hayes, Hitchcock, Howard. Keya Paha, Kimball, McPherson, Nuckolls, Red Willow. Sheridan, Stanton, Valley and Webster. Douglas and Lancaster counties, naturally, have sent the most. Douglas county has sent practically 40 per cent and Lancaster 15 per cent of all cases admitted here since the institution started. It is my opinion that some law should be enacted that would require a county from which a patient comes, to pay </seg>
            <seg id="p006">386 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF about half of the patient's expense, say $1.00 per day per patient. The county could either pay this itself or collect from the patient whatever part he is really able to pay. Many people come here who are financially able to give something toward their maintenance, but do not, as they feel that since the state is providing it, they are not called upon to do so. We will have a deficiency of about $18,000.00 for the biennium. I do not believe this needs any extended ex - planation. Everyone realizes the great increase that has taken place in the last two years in the cost of food and other supplies, and we are really fortunate in not being in a worse financial condition than we are. The institution at all times has been sufficiently well provided for, but econ - omy has been practiced in every line that we thought possi - ble, where it would not produce a material loss in efficiency to the institution in its care of tuberculous people. Our garden has been a help in reducing the expense of maintenance and in addition gave a variety which might not have been possible otherwise. Our potato crop has been particularly gratifying. We have raised a few chickens, but hope to increase this number before our next report. Our pigs have brought us a nice return and a limited num - ber are by all means a paying proposition. We sterilize and cook our slop at the same time by means of live steam, thus keeping our pigs from developing tuberculosis, besides getting more results from our slop. All of the money appropriated for land has not been spent. This is due to the fact that land prices in the neigh - borhood rose unduly, and we did not feel the land was worth what was asked for it. My recommendations for the coming biennium are as follows : MAINTENANCE It has actually cost $48,000.00 to keep an average of seventy-five patients for the ten months ending October 1, 1918. This is an average of $64.00 per patient per month or $768.00 per patient per year. With our accommodations </seg>
            <seg id="p007">THE BOARD OK COMMISSIONERS 387 increased so that our capacity is 108, we should have an average of 100 patients for the coming biennium. At $768.00 per year, per person, it would cost $153,600.00 to maintain 100 patients the coming two years, and this amount would be divided about as follows: Salaries and Wages General Repairs . . . $ 39.600.00 3.000.00 Other Maintenant 111,000.00 $153,600.00 EQUIPMENT The hospital has never been completely equipped. There are a good many things still needed. Some of these are small, others are large, but there are so many that the total amount is greater than one might think. Some of the larger items needed are refrigerating plant, steam vegetable cooker, combined dishwasher and sterilizer, added laundry equipment, moving picture machine, dental equipment, Ro - entger ray machine, dumb waiter, ordinary hospital equip - ment, such as beside tables and chiffoniers, and some office furniture. To purchase these and a number of smaller items, it will require fully $10,500.00. If the third floor of the Stone building is remodeled for employees, which I am asking for under the head of im - provements, it will be necessary to furnish this part of the building complete. This will cost at least $1,000.00. IMPROVEMENTS The outside walls of the Green cottage at the present time are covered with shingles, many of which are in very bad condition, and on account of this, it is almost impossi - ble to keep the building sufficiently warm during the winter months. Something must be done, and I would recommend stuccoing the building. For this and some needed improve - ments inside of the house, I would suggest that an appro - priation of $1,150.00 be made. A coal bin at least as large as the one we have at the present time should be built, as it is necessary for us to </seg>
            <seg id="p008">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF 388 store large amounts of coal. This would cost in the neigh - borhood of $1,500.00. There is considerable concrete work that should de done about the institution including sidewalks, some work on a short stretch of road immediately behind the hospital, and a cave for storing our vegetables for the winter. At least $800.00 should be provided for this work. The lawn deserves more care than it has heretofore re - ceived. To keep the grass mowed without too much ex - pense a power or horse-drawn lawn mower should be pro - vided. For this 1 request $500.00. Wagon scales should be purchased for us, as we fre - quently need these to weigh coal, hay and other commodi - ties in large quantities. It will cost at least $300.00 to install these. The room that is provided for the employees at the present time is filled to overflowing, and it will be necessary for us to make some further provision. There is a third floor in the Stone building that can be made into very comfortable quarters for at least eight or nine employees. Xo doubt this would be the most satisfactory thing to do, and the most economical, everything considered I believe that this remodeling could be done for about $2,000.00. NEW BUILDINGS As a result of the war we are going to have many more cases of tuberculosis seeking admission to this hospital. Many returned soldiers must be cared for and I believe every one feels accomodations should be provided for them. A well constructed building is the most economical in the long run. No less than $100,000.00 should be provided for the construction and furnishing of a new building. LAND At present time I do not feel that there is any im - mediate necessity for an appropriation for more land. In conclusion I wish to express to you and your em - ployees, thanks for all help you have extended to me in </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 389 managing this institution. I wish also to express my ap - preciation of the help the library commission has rendered this institution. Books, magazines and newspapers have been supplied us in goodly numbers. In a hospital of this kind these things are essentials and I hope the legislature will see its way clear to increase the appropriations for this splendid department of state work. I wish, also to thank many others who have aided in different ways in making the institution more useful and of greater benefit to our patients, and more enjoyable and harmonious to all con - cerned.
