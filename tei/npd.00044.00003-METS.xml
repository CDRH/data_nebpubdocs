McKelvie, Governor of Nebraska: Sir: In compliance with the requirements of Section 6119 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 as amended, we have the honor to submit herewith our Eleventh Annual Report, covering the year end - in December 31, 1918. Very respectfully, THOS. L. HALL, Chairman H. G. TAYLOR, Commissioner VICTOR E. WILSON, Commissioner Attest: T. A. BROWNE, Secretary. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">PART I GENERAL REVIEW Supervision of the operation of common carriers for which this Commission was primarily created was, during the past year, accom - panied by difficulties and perplexities never before existing and possibly never to occur again in the regulation of public utilities. Extreme curtailment of what have heretofore been common conveniences, made necessary in part by scarcity of labor and materials; the effort of the federal government to control service and rates of most common carriers of the nation; the overlapping jurisdictions between states and nation, leading to the vigorous and widespread contest in the latter part of the year; the tremendous increases in costs to the public; — these things rather added to than detracted from the work of state commissions. Regulation by the states of utilities wholly within their borders has been on trial, and the end is not yet. The Nebraska Commission contemplated the invasion by the federal government in the last days of 1917 with some misgivings, but acquiesced in much that was done under so-called war necessities. It witnessed arbitrary and hasty increases in passenger and freight rates, and after protesting against the failure of the federal government to listen to both sides, put no obstacle in the way so long as the war lasted, and cooperated in the efforts of the national government for conservation of men and materials. It refused to consider demands of parts of the public which in normal times would have received serious consideration. It maintained its organization and in the mad rush of events and the rough jostling by new-found federal authority, did not lose sight of the importance of the day of adjustment. Just at the end of the year, with the armistice signed and peace in sight, the Commission began to move conservatively in the direction of readjustment. In its conclusion that the most important period in the history of regulation of public utilities lies in the two years ahead, the Commission is but emphasizing the opinion of experts everywhere. Regulating bodies must hold the scales firm between public demands and needs and utilities' capacity of performance in determining how far and how fast service shall be restored to pre-war conditions. It may be a long time before costs are reduced to the level found adequate in ante-bellum days How successful the Nebraska Commission will be in its part of the great work will depend on the patience of the public and its confidence in the judgment and sincerity of the body which it has chosen to carry out this intricate and complicated task. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 8 Federal Control of Railroads Under the authority conferred by the act of Congress approved August 29, 1916, the President of the United States, by proclamation dated December 26, 1917, to take effect at noon December 28, 1917, took possession of and assumed control of all the systems of transportation within the boundaries of the continental United States, consisting of railroads operated by steam or electric power, terminals, equipment including private car lines, telegraph and telephone lines, and all other appurtenances commonly used in operating railroads or combined rail - roads and water systems of transportation. For accounting purposes, it was declared that the railroad* were taken over as of January 1, 1918. This action was taken suddenly and caused much surprise. It followed a period of extensive and dangerous congestion of traffic at the eastern seaboard, which congestion had backed up as far as Chicago and the Mississippi river and was seriously interfering with railroad operation to the westward. The winter had been unusually severe, the demand for cars for moving freight very abnormal. Government business, including the transportation of troops and munitions, was a primary consideration and was greatly mismanaged. Endless priority orders issued by government officials, little and big, had had much to do with the congested conditions in the eastern states. The railroads were handicapped by the congressional restrictions, accumulated during a long peace period, whereby they were unable to pool equipment and energies with the greatest efficiency. Railroad finances were dejected, securities, even of the best managed roads, were slumping violently and continu - ously. The financial situation constituted one of the most important factors which led to the sudden action of the executive. By proclamation of the President, William G. McAdoo, secretary of the treasury of the United States, was made director general of rail - roads and to him the President delegated all the powers which Congress had vested in the executive relative to the operation of these transporta - tion systems. The proclamation provided that until the director should act otherwise, transportation systems "shall remain subject to all exist - ing statutes and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and to all statutes and orders of regulating commissions for the various states in which said systems or any part thereof may be situated, but any orders, general or special, hereafter made by said director shall have paramount authority and be obeyed as such." On March 21, 1918, the President approved an act of Congress which sought both to define and to limit the powers given to the President the preceding August, and under which he had assumed control of the rail - roads. The act provided that federal control should continue during the period of the war and for a period thereafter not exceeding one year and nine months from the proclamation of peace, the President </seg>
            <seg id="p009">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 9 being granted power to relinquish such federal control or any part of it over all or any part of the transportation systems whenever he deemed it advisable. The Disputed Proviso A proviso was inserted in this act of Congress which read as follows: "That nothing in this act shall be construed to amend, repeal, im - pair, or affect the existing laws or powers of the states in relation to taxation or the lawful police regulations of the several states, except wherein such laws, powers, or regulations may affect the transportation of troops, war materials, government supplies, or the issue of stocks and bonds." Immediately, the director general began a rather complete reorgani - zation of the transportation systems of the country. He developed a central organization at Washington with directors primarily responsible for different divisions of the operation of the roads, these divisions being (a) operation, (b) public service and accounting, (c) traffic, (d) law, (e) finance and purchase, (f) betterments and additions. The country was divided up into operating districts, five in number, each presided over by a regional director responsible through the division of operation at Washington to the director general himself. The western region was itself divided into three parts: northwestern, central western, and southwestern divisions, all of which had territory located within the state of Nebraska. On May 25 the director general issued a sweeping order increasing passenger and freight rates throughout the entire United States. Pas - senger rates, effective June 10, were increased fifty to seventy-five per cent in much of the territory of the United States, and freight rates with certain exceptions were increased twenty-five per cent effective on June 25, thirty days after the issuance of the order. This order was made without consultation with any shippers or state regulating bodies, and specifically applied not only to interstate traffic but to state traffic as well. On some commodity rates the increases were very extensive. For instance, coarse grain rates were in some places advanced almost one hundred per cent. The order undertook to strike down all state classifications and to apply interstate classifications, thereby effecting still further increases. McAdoo Urges Cooperation On the day following the issuance of the order, a lengthy telegram was sent by Mr. McAdoo to each state commission urging its cooperation and acquiescence in what bad been done. The increases thus hastily made exceeded anything that bad to that time been asked by the rail - ro*4s as reasonable revenues. The provision relative to classifications </seg>
            <seg id="p010">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 10 within the states were soon modified following an ultimatum delivered to the director general by a considerable body of United States senators whose rate fabrics had been roughly disturbed. The modification pro - vided that state classifications should remain in force. This affected Nebraska, which has a classification of its own somewhat different from the interstate classification. Tinkering with rates has continued steadily since the issuance of General Order No. 28. The United States railroad administration pro - vided traffic committees in various parts of the country composed of railroad men and shippers' representatives, with railroad men in the majority on every committee. Sub-committees, similarly constituted, were established in other places. One of these was located at Kansas City, Missouri, and another still later at Omaha, Nebraska. These committees had but little plenary powers. The first intention of the railroad administration was to carry out in a measure the scheme as outlined to Congress before the passage of the railroad control act, and to work in conjunction with the state commissions and the Interstate Commerce Commission. This was de - parted from first in the issuance of the general rate advance order by the director general, but provision was made in a circular sent broad - cast shortly thereafter by Edward Chambers, director of traffic at Wash - ington, primarily in control of rate schedules for the federal railroad administration, that subsequent changes in rates after the promulgation of the big general increase should be made only in conjunction with and by permission of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the state regulating commissions. This circular was dated June 20, 1918, and indicated that after having made the first big plunge it was not the purpose of the railroad administration to act arbitrarily and hastily thereafter. On July 1, 1918, this circular was amended showing that the rail - road administration had changed its position and intended thereafter to promulgate rates as suited it, with no regard to the regulatory author - ities, both federal and state. This circular of July 1 definitely ordered all carriers to make no applications "to the Interstate Commerce Com - mission or to any state commissions for authority to advance or modify rates, fees, charges, classifications, regulations or practices applying wholly on such carriers, nor for authority to publish changes therein on short notice." It ordered all railroads to withdraw any pending appli - cations before the state commissions and the Interstate Commerce Com - mission. Under that order, some two score applications then pending before the Nebraska Comission were withdrawn. Under that order, no applications were made to the Nebraska Commission on matters of rates during the remainder of the year 1918. The Nebraska Commission, as well as many other commissions, took the position soon after the passage of the federal control act that the exception in the act, reserving to th» states the police powers, in* </seg>
            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 (luded the power to make and change rates of such public utilities as the state had placed under the supervision of the State Railway Com - mission. The railroad administration took the position that all that had been reserved to the states by the expression "police regulations" re - lated to the safety and health of the public. War time conditions prevailed and the Nebraska Commission de - cided not to assert the state's rights as against the federal authorities unless compelled to do so by force of circumstances. No suit was brought for that purpose. The carriers operating in Nebraska, however, filed a motion in a case already pending in court relative to class freight rate advances which brought squarely before the federal court the interpreta - tion of this controverted provision in the law, and the Nebraska Com - mission, through its legal department, presented its views in the matter. Unfortunately, no such decision was secured, as the carriers withdrew the motion shortly after the argument and rendered unnecessary any conclusions on the part of the court. Following the signing of the armistice in November, the Commis - sion carried into court the question of federal control over purely intra - state freight rates in an aggravated situation on short hauls of clay near Columbus, Nebraska. The case was brought in a district court of the state and was removed by the federal administration to the federal court, where it is yet pending. Holding to the position that the federal government was usurping power in changing freight and passenger rates in wholly Nebraska terri - tory, and that the district freight traffic committees located at Omaha and Kansas City were without any power legally to transact the busi - ness undertaken by them, this Commission not only refused to appear before these traffic committees on any matters affecting purely Nebras - ka business, but refused to file as legal rates any of the changes pro - mulgated by the federal administration on Nebraska traffic. The Com - mission was not arbitrary in its position, for it did not hesitate, when Congress was considering the future of the railroads, to advise that in case the roads were turned back to private ownership the original rate changes made by the federal administration would be approved as emer - gency rates and would stand until such time as after investigation it had been clearly shown they were not proper rates. In spite of these circumstances the Commission was busy on very many railroad matters. Complaints relative to crossings, depot facili - ties, train service, sidetracks and kindred matters, while somewhat re - duced in consequence of the war and at other times discouraged by the Commission for the same reason, were numerous. For several months after the railroads were taken over under government order there was strong tendency on the part of representatives of the rail - roads, and of the federal government as well, to deny the jurisdiction of the Commission to deal with any of these matters, and a plea to </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT that effect was made in all contested cases. In the latter part of the year there was evidence of an abandonment by the federal railroad ad - ministration of its position on all other matters than issuance of securi - ties and the making of rates. Express Companies. In keeping with its tendency to reach out and to regulate very many kinds of industries under its 1 war powers, the federal government sanctioned a consolidation of the express companies of the country, which consolidation took place July 1, 1918. On June 25, C. A. Prouty, director of public service under the railroad administration at Wash - ington, sent telegrams to the half dozen middle western states which had not up to that time approved the interstate method of collecting express charges, advising them of the intention of the federal govern - ment to undertake express rate making, and asking their cooperation in this effort. The Nebraska Commission replied that it would be glad to consider an application by the consolidated express company, known at the American Railway Express, and thts application was made by wire. The company sought to have applied the interstate rules and regulations governing express charges and the increased rates proposed by the federal administration. Hearing was set for July 8 and was later on motion of applicant postponed indefinitely. The Commission had, however, considered the extensive testimony presented by the express companies prior to their consolidation wherein they sought to show the necessity for rate increases, and, while this case had not been concluded, the Commission had been working through its rate department on a schedule of rates being prepared by it as a war time measure and as shown by this previous testimony. Notice was died by the federal government that on January 1, 1919, consider - able increases in express rates would be ordered the country over. This was similar action to that taken in May when freight rates were ad - vanced. On December 21, the Commission issued an order to show cause, accompanied by extensive rate schedules requiring the American Railway Express to appear on December 30 and explain why the rates found proper by the Commission should not be put into effect. The newly created express company refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the Nebraska authorities and did not appear. The Commission issued the order making the schedule found reasonable by it effective on Nebraska traffic. Application was immediately made to the supreme court of the state of Nebraska for a mandatory writ of mandamus requiring the express company to put the rates found proper by the Nebraska Com - mission into effect on intrastate business. The court, however, issued an alternative writ and set the matter down for hearing early in 1919. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 13 Federal Control of Telephones. On July 22, 1918, the President issued a proclamation taking over the operation of the telegraph, telephone, cable and radio systems of the entire nation, and appointed Postmaster General A. S. Burleson as his representative to operate these extensive properties until such time as the postmaster general might deem it proper to relinquish any or all of them. This action on the part of the President was taken as a result of the passage at his request of a joint resolution by Congress on July 16, authorizing him, whenever he deemed necessary, to take over as a war measure the wire systems of the country and to opera'* them until the close of the war. The resolution provided for just com - pensation to the owners of the properties, and provided further a means oy which unsatisfied owners might bring suit against the government for settlement of compensation. This resolution of congress did not mention rate-making as one of the duties falling to the federal govern - ment. It did provide "that nothing in this act shall be construed to amend, repeal, impair or affect existing laws or powers of the several states in relation to taxation or the lawful police regulation of the several states except where such laws, powers' or regulations may affect the transmission of government communications or the issue of stocks and bonds by such system or systems." The President's order provided that the control of the wire companies should pass to Mr. Burleson on July 31 at midnight. He directed that until such time as his department had ordered otherwise all officers of all companies should remain as operating officials, but turning over to the postmaster general all powers which the President himself might have relating to the handling of the wire systems. Hostility within the states was at once manifest to this action on the part of the federal government, largely because there was no ap - parent reason for their being taken over as a war measure. One month after the effective date of the President's proclamation the postmaster general issued his Bulletin No. 5, presuming to fix rates for installation of telephone service and for moving telephone equipment. These rates were inflexible, and promulgated more for the purpose of prohibiting the use of material than as payment for services rendered. Protests on the part of the public were in marked contrast with the manner in which they received the order increasing freight rates. But the war was still in progress and state commissions were reluctant to test out the right of the federal government in this further extension of its powers. However, on October 2 the Nebraska Commission did file in the federal court for the southern district of Nebraska an application for a permanent injunction against the postmaster general, as an officer of the federal government, to prevent his undertaking to reglate the matter of rates of telephone companies within Nebraska. Elaborate preparations were made both by the Commission and by the federal government on this case. The Nebraska Commission was not so inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT ested in beading off the collection of the charges as an immediate matter as It was in securing a decision as to the right of the federal government thus to invade the police powers of the states.' Stipulations entered into made it necessary to postpone the arguments until January 17, 1919. In tlta luearuiine elaborate biicfs were prepared by the state and by the postoffice department. The vigorous opposition of the public to the installation charges and the cessation of hostilities in the great war led to modification of the order relative to installation charges, putting them on a more mod - erate basis, effective December 1, 1918. On December 13, 1918, the postmaster general took the next step in assuming complete control. He issued an order prescribing uniform toll rates throughout the United States, effective January 21, 1919, and to apply between states and within states. This was known as Post - master General's Order No. 2495. This order provided several classes of service, and was built on a different plan than any telephone toll rates used in the central west. It proffered a less effective kind of service at a cheaper rate for short distances than had been charged theretofore, and service of the same standard as ha.l been offered before tit somewhat higher rates than had been charged. Immediately the evidence from a majority of the states indicated that the attorney generals and the regulating commissions proposed to test the right of the federal government to thus extend federal police powers, both the right of Congress to authorize such extension and the question whether it did authorize such action bein^ vigorously presented. While practically no other states than Nebraska assailed the installa - tion and moving charges of the postmaster general, it was evident by the end of the year that most of the states would join in litigation relative to the fixing of toll and subscribers' service rates. This litiga - tion will be a prominent factor of 1919 developments in regulation of public utilities. IMPORTANT LITIGATION Besides the litigation growing out of the federal intervention in state matters, the Commission was actively interested in a number of important matters in the courts, both state and federal. The Missouri Pacific passenger rate case, in which that railroad was attacking the two-cent state law, was argued finally before the special master on October 23, 1918. almost two years and a half after the first testimony was taken. At the end of the year no conclusions had been presented to the court by the mabter and it is quite possible that 1919 would be fairly well gone before the federal court reaches a conclusion. This case has been most voluminous, the testimony run - ning up to 2500 pages or more, with a vast number of intricate exhibits. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 15 The Rock Island case, of similar import, before the same federal court, was gotten under way at a considerably later date, and not until January of 1918 was the first evidence presented before the courts special master, John F. Stout, of Omaha. The rest of the testimony in this case had not been presented at the close of the year, although it is anticipated that conclusions from the special master to the court will be made in this case as soon as in the Missouri Pacific case, for the reason that the case was not so extensively contested. Findings by the Commission as to proper street railway rates for the Lincoln Traction company and for the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company were appealed to the supreme court of the state by applicant companies. In the Lincoln Traction case an emer - gency increase was granted, but surrounded by certain conditions, to which the company took exception. The case was elaborately briefed by the city of Lincoln as well as by the appellant and was argued to - ward the close of the year. No conclusion had been reached by the court at the end of this report period. The Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company appealed from the finding by the Commission that no emergency was shown to exist. In two cases involving service and facilities of the Missouri Pacific Railway company the supreme court found against the state and in be - half of the Missouri Pacific. In 1916 the Commission entered an ord«r directing the Missouri Pacific Railway company to install a passenger train on what is known as the Crete branch, where service had con - sisted of a combination passenger and freight train each way each day. On April 26, 1918, the court handed down an opinion, reversing and remanding the case for further consideration, on two grounds, first, that the court took judicial notice that a state of war between the United States and Germany existed and that all the resources of the country were necessary in this war, to the exclusion of improved railway serv - ice, and second, that it was doubtful whether the proposed train could be operated without financial loss to the appellant railway company. The Commission had also, prior to the declaration of war, ordered this same railroad company to build a depot at Ralston. The supre.ne court remanded this case on appeal for the sole reason of the existence of a state of war, which had come to pass after the case was lodged in the supreme court.

            <seg id="p019">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 19 CAR SERVICE Shortage of freight car equipment during 1918 was not one of the important features of raliway operation in Nebraska for the reason that the federal government undertook by arbitrary action to control the volume of shipment by choking it at its source. By orders of the food administration, supplemented by those of the federal railway ad - ministration, it was impossible during most of 1918 to ship either grain or live stock without first having secured permits from the car service commission, an operating body connected with the federal railway ad - ministration. No matter how many empty cars might be available, the volume of shipment was controlled by this permit system, which could be used only in connected with the government flat, exercised as a war power. The restriction on the shipment of coarse grain was lifted late in the year and that on wheat still later. The live stock embargo was a marked feature of the closing months of the year. This action was so closely identified with price-fixing by the government and the conduct of the war that neither in Nebraska nor in other states was the ques - tion of the equity of these rules seriously raised by state regulating bodies. Meanwhile an effort was made to clear the atmosphere relative to rules governing car distribution in shortage periods after the release of railroads from federal domination should occur. Three conferences were held at Chicago at the suggestion of the Interstate Commerce Commission for the purpose of formulating a set of rules which might be applied uniformly in the grain producing section. These conferences were attended by representatives of nine state commissions, by various shipping organizations, by representatives of the federal railway ad - ministration, and by the representative of' the Interstate Commerce Commission. Numerous propositions were submitted and rejected as untenable, and at the close of the year it appeared probable that rules similar to those adopted by the Nebraska State Railawy Commission and in conformity with the Nebraska statute would be approved at the final conference and recommended to the Interstate Commerce Commission for its consideration on interstate shipments. CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION Interstate Commerce Commission Docket No. 975, St. Joseph Live Stock Echange v. C. B. A Q. R. R. Co., and Docket No. 9928, Kansas City Live Stock Echange v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. In this case the Interstate Commerce Commission's attorney examiner has made a tentative report in which he finds that the rates on catfle and sheep from stations west and north of Aurora on the Burlington to Omaha are discriminatory as against St. Joseph and Kansas City, wherein the St. Joseph and Kansas City rates exceed the Omaha rates five cents per hundredweight. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 20 The examiner also found that the return free transportation for caretakers of one carload of live stock from the Omaha market to Nebraska stations was discriminatory as compared with interstate rule, which does not allow reurn transportation for caretakers of one carload of live stock when shipped to St. Joseph and Kansas City. Briefs have been filed and oral arguments had before the Commis - sion in Washington. As yet the final decision of the Interstate Com - mission has not been handed down. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket No. 9009. Rules for settle - ment of Claims for Loss and Damage to Grain in Transit. In 1917 the Interstate Commerce Commission, on its own motion, began an exten - sive investigation into the adequacy of existing rules for settling claims for damage to grain in transit, with particular reference to arbitrary deductions for natural shrinkage. The Nebraska Commission intervened and appeared at one of the hearings at Omaha in the latter part of 1917. Tentative findings of the examiner who heard the case were to the effect that shippers and carriers should in conference attempt to ascertain equitable rules and recommend the same to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Nebraska Commission filed exceptions to this report and briefed the exceptions. Oral argument was held in Wash - ington January 17, 1918. Later the Interstate Commerce Commission approved practically all the findings of the examiner. Meanwhile, independently of the action of the federal regulating body, the Nebraska Commission held hearings on formal complaints as to tariff provisions applied to Nebraska shipments of grain where the carriers interpreted all shipments of grain from interior points to Omaha as being interstate in movements, provided they move on pro - portional rates. By order, the Nebraska Commission found the rule for arbitrary deductions unreasonable. The carriers appealed to the supreme court. Later the Union Pacific withdrew its appeal, but continued the practice of making the arbitrary deductions. At the close of the year the Commission was gathering data in preparation for additional action. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket No. 10167. Sioux City Live Stock Association v. Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Co. et al. Re - turn Transportation to Caretakers of Live Stock. The Sioux City Live Stock Association complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission that the Nebraska rule, based on statute, allowing return transportation to caretakers of live stock on shipments of one or more cars, discrim - inated against the Sioux City markets and in favor of Omaha markets because the interstate rule required that shipments consist of two or more cars in order to secure return transportation. Hearing was held at Sioux City on July 22, 1918, before Examiner Worthington and the Nebraska Commission entered appearance and submitted considerable testimony in opposition to the allegation of dis - crimination. The question was carefully briefed by the Commission, </seg>
            <seg id="p021">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 21 but oral argument, set for the latter part of the year, was waived by all parties to the controversy inasmuch as the same questions were be - ing argued in the complaint of Sioux City Live Stock Exchange v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. No final conclusions had been reached at the close of the year. Town of Torrington v. C. B. A Q. R. R. Co. (The Henry Case.) The Interstate Commerce Commission has rendered an opinion in this case, finding that the town of Torrington was discriminated against in its rates on carload shipments of cattle and horses to Omaha as com - pared with rates from Henry on like live stock to Omaha. But in view of the fact that the director general of railroads had not been made a party to the proceedings, and because very material changes in the com - parative rates complained of had been brought about by the orders of the director general, no order was entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in connection with the findings. Memphis Southwestern Case, I. C. C. 9702 et al...This is an exten - sive investigation begun early in 1918 by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission into discriminatory features alleged to exist on interstate rates west of the Mississippi river. The city of Memphis complained as to adjustment of rates into Texas and Arkansas as compared with rates from St. Louis into like territory. The subject matter of the complaint rapidly broadened by the intervention of various parties until it took in readjustment of rates west of the Mississippi into Kansas City and adjacent territory, and at once became of interest to shippers of Ne - braska. Hearings were held in Kansas City beginning April 15 and June 10, 1918, and much testimony was taken. The Nebraska Commis - sion entered appearance because of effect of rates into Nebraska from points east of the Mississippi. War conditions prevented the conclusion of the investigation and additional hearings will be held in 1919. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket No. 8182. The Cement Case. Several supplemental orders have been entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case since the original opinion was handed down by the Commission. General Order No. 28 of the director general of railroads materially affected the rate adjustment on carload shipments of cement in the territory covered by this case. Recently one of the complaintants, namely, the Universal Portland Cement company, of Buffington, Illinois, has appealed to the Interstate Commerce Com - mission to reopen the case for the purpose of offering new testimony, intended to show that the order of the Commission is discriminatory in certain features. The Lincoln Commercial club and the Nebraska Commission are also asking the Interstate Commerce Commission to reopen the case for the purpose of submitting new testimony as to the adjustment of the cement rates from the Kansas Gas Belt territory to Lincoln and other Nebraska stations. As yet the Nebraska Commission has not indicated whether or not it will intervene farther in the matter. </seg>

Advance irt Potato Rate* from North and South Dakota and Minnesota Producing Point* to Nebraska Station*. Since the closing of our annual report of last year the Interstate Commerce Commission has handed down an opinion in this case denying the application of the railroad companies to increase their rates on carload shipments of potatoes from North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin points to Nebraska sta - tions. Express Rates. Since the last annual report was made up, the Interstate Commerce Commission has entered its order in this case, wherein it found that in the opinion of the Commission the present plan of paying the railroad companies for the transportation of express matter was unscientific and should properly be changed. The Commission also found that if the director general proposed to increase the express rates, the same might properly be accomplished by increasing all rates a certain percentage in different zones. Subsequent to the filing of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the director general of railroads directed the express com - panies to increase their interstate rates approximately ten per cent in all of the different express zones. At the same time the director gen - eral of railroads directed the express companies to increase their intra - state rates in the states of South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska to the interstate schedule, both as to the amount of rates and the classification of commodities. This order of the director general became effective January 1, 1919. Kansas City Millers' Club et al. v. A. T. &amp; 8. F. Ry. Co. Minimum Weights of Grain Product*. The Interstate Commerce Commission handed down an opinion In this case in which they found that a minimum weight less than 40,000 lbs. on carload shipments of grain products in Nebraska was discriminatory as compared to Kansas City and ordered that the railroad companies remove the discrimination by applying the 40,000-lbs. minimum on Nebraska intrastate shipments. The legal department of the Commission is preparing a case to be presented to the federal court of the western district of Missouri, for the purpose of testing the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission advancing the minimum weight to 40,000 lbs. on straight or mixed car load shipments of flour or mill feed on Nebraska intrastate traffic. </seg>

This summary does not include a vast amount of correspondence on matters pertaining to the business of the department but classified as correspondence only. It will be noted that no small part of the Commission's activities relates to claims against the railway companies either because of alleged overcharges or because of loss or damage in transit. Over the latter class of claims the Commission has no jurisdiction but it does offer its services in negotiating with the carriers, and reaches settlement for many complainants. In th&gt;; list also will be found certain complaints concerning sidetracks and industry sites. The Commission has been denied jurisdiction over su -li matters by the United States supreme court, but it uses its g ).vl offices any- way. Parts II and III of this report relate also to the duties and activities of the Commission as summarized below. Part II is a brief review of each formal complaint handled during the year, and also of each informal complaint and application. In most instances informal complaints are handled fer correspondence. Many of the applications require no hear- ing, when the interest of the public is safeguarded without such action. Part III contains the opinions of the Commission on cases which have called for extensive investigations and testimony and careful analysis and findings. Formal Complaints Twenty-two formal complaints were filed during the year, classified as follows: Telephone service « Train service ; 1 Crossing facilities 1 Car shortage and distribution 4 Acceptance of perishable goods for shipment in low tempera- ture weather 1 Closing hour of freight depots 1 Physical connection between tracks of railroad companies 1 Maintenance of switches and transfer facilities I Repaving of street occupied by street railway tracks \ Requirement of irrigation company to furnish water under water right contract , 1 Removal of railway facilities „ I Removal ot footbridge and safe location of highway bridge I Total S3 </seg>

The Commission is further of the opinion that the defendant herein should spot carload traffic to be unloaded at Valley, Nebraska, on other tracks in its yards at that point in order to relieve the congestion on the tracks above referred to where they cross Spruce street. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the defendant herein spot its cars on its' tracks where they cress Spruce street in Valley, Nebraska, so as to leave a clearance of 6ixty feet on the east and west sides of said street.

It extends eastward on O street to 42d street, a distance of six blocks, and four blocks east of the present terminus. The complainants herein live on both sides of O street and east cf the two cemeteries referred to, and when they wish to take the cemetery cars it is necessary for them to go to O street, thence west between the two cemeteries to 38th street. The Commission has made a careful study of the population of that district. It has required the Traction company and the city to make independent studies of the traffic on the cemetery line and file the same with the Commission. There is not a great difference between the two studies. However, they both conclusively show that the territory to be served does not furnish sufficient traffic to justify an extension of the line at the present time, even if prices of material and cost of maintenance were normal, but at this particular time when the cost of all steel and copper products, ties, machinery and labor and the cost of maintenance are sto abnormally high, the Commission would not be justified in ordering the extension, for it would only increase the cost of operation of the system, without any corresponding increase in revenue, and other parts of the iystem would be compelled to make up the deficiency While the prayer of the complainants cannot be granted, the Com - mission is of the opinion, from the testimony, and so finds, that the present terminal facilities at 38th street are not adequate to reasonably take care of the traffic at that point. The present terminus is located on the public highway east of the east end of O street pavement and at the foot of a long steep hill, and with poor drainage facilities, thereby allow - ing the water to settle at that point to the extent that frequently the tracks are entirely submerged and mud is washed over the tracks and over the platform. The two cemeteries are heavily wooded.

Having fully in mind all the conditions, the Commission is of the opinion that a cement platform at least four feet wide and as long as the length of cars that are operated on that line should be laid on the south side of the tracks at or near 38th street; said platform should be elevated to a height that will enable passengers to easily step into the cars. On the south side of the platform there should be a suitable sta - tion erected, not smaller than ten feet long and six feet wide, the floor of which is to be on a level with the platform referred to, the north side of said building to be entirely open but closed in at both ends 1 on the south side.

Said terminal building shall be six feet deep and ten feet wide, extending east and west on the south side and adjacent to said platform, the floor of said building to be on a level with that of the platform. The east and west ends and south side s.hall be entirely closed, leaving the north side entirely open.

            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 133 OPINION AND FINDING This complaint was filed on February 21, 1917. It charges' defendant TAYLOR Commissioner: with discrimination in the distribution of cars for grain loading at the station of Lebanon. At the time the complaint was filed, Section 5982, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, was in effect, reading as follows: "Whenever there shall be such an unusual demand for cars that it shall be impossible for the railroad company to supply the same it shall fill all applications for cars proportioned to any given ship - ping point in the order requested: Provided, individuals shipping their own grain or freight, and persons, corporations or associations owning, operating or controlling elevators, or engaged in a general grain and shipping business', shall be entitled to cars proportioned according to the amount of grain each appliacnt has ready for immediate shipment at time ot application." The entire record in this matter is confined to the capacities of the elevators at Lebanon, the amount of grain on hand in the various ele - vators, and the cars' furnished to each during the grain shipping season up to the time of the hearing, all of which facts were essential under the requirements of the sVatute as it then existed. During the time this complaint was pending and subsequent to the hearing, the legislature of 1917 repealed the above statute and enacted what is now known as the "Car Distribution Law," Chapter 221, Laws of Nebraska, 1917. In view, therefore, of the changed legal status and of the fact that an order issued in accordance with the law as it exir'ed at the time this complaint was filed would not now be enforceable, it is unnecessary to review the record or make any findings as to the law &lt;&gt;r the facts.

            <seg id="p132">134 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: The complaint herein was filed on March 14, 1917. It charges de - fendant with having practised discrimination in the distribution of cars for grain loading at Atlanta. The complaint is based on the statute in effect at that time, which was as follows: "Whenever there shall ba such an unusual demand for cars that it shall be impossible for the railroad company to supply the same it shall fill all applications for cars proportioned to any given shipping point in the order requested: Provided, individuals shipping their own grain or freight, and persons, corporations or associations own - ing, operating or controlling elevators, or engaged in a general grain and shipping business, shall be entitled to cars proportioned accord - ing to the amount of grain each applicant has ready for immediate shipment at time of application." Compiled Statute* of Nebraska, Sec. 5982. Subsequent to the filing of this complaint and the hearing thereon, the statute just quoted was' repealed by the legislature of 1917 and the act known as the "Car Distribution Law" was enacted (Chapter 221, Laws of Nebraska, 1917). This act materially changes the requirements for the distribution of cars between shippers at stations. In view, there - fore, of the changed legal status and of the fact that an order issued in accordance with the law a.-' it existed at the time this complaint was filed would not now be enforceable, it is unnecessary to review the record or make any findings. The complaint accordingly will be dis - missed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint herein be and the same is hereby dismissed.

The contracts of employment are individual and ar«' indefinite as to time; they are veibal, being sup - plemented by printed rules laid down by the company, which provide, among other things, for increases in pay and certain perquisites to those remaining in service for specified periods' of time. These relations be - tween the employees and the company have obtained since its organiza - tion in 1909. During the early part of the year 1917 the employees became dis satisfied with their conditions of employment and decided to form a union in order more effectually to enforce their demands against the company ing Division No. 744 of the Amalga - ric Railway Employees of America, were taken up with the company, The organization was effected by torn mated Association of Street and Elec Thereafter the demands of the men some of which ihe company agreed :o and o"hers of which it rejected, e principal question involved; the The recognition of the union was t company wholly refused to recogniz the union or to deal with it.

No useful purpose could be subserved by detailing the history of the s'irike. It followed the usual course, leading to heavy loss on both sides and imposing great hardship on the public. Prior to the strike, and when it became known that it was impending, both parties were invited by the Commission to appear before it to solve the difficul - ties, but neither availed itself of the opportunity. Notwithstanding the offer of the Commission, the employees, under most unwise leadership, elected to disregard the Commission and to take matters into their own hands to force the company to recognize the union, and to that end called a strike and wholly disrupted the service of the company. The responsibility for the disastrous results that followed must be borne by those who ordered the strike. It is apparent from the record that had the Commission had opportunity to settle the trouble, the strike and all of its attending and unfortunate results might have been averted. It goes without saying that no one whose action contributed to the disrup - tion of the public service can now be heard to complain that the com - pany did not render proper service.

In their prayer complainants asked that the company be required to restore adequate service, that the Commission order that in the future ihe company should not dis - charge employees because o^ membership in a union, and that the dis - charged employees be restored to their former positions. On the 15th day of May the Commission entered an order providing for the investiga - tion of the service rendered by the company and the terms and conditions of employment of all of its' employees, with a view to making such an order as a proper standard .f public service might require. A hearing was had and a very voluminous record was made. The general investi - gation by the Commission was not pressed, nor was the character of the service rendered by the company reconsidered at length, but both were made subordinate, the efforts of the complainants centering on the re - instatement of the discharged employees'. At the time the hearing closed — and the decision must be entered as of that date — the service rendered by the company, which had been greatly crippled by the strike, had been largely restored. Owing to the sympathy of many of the citizens of the city with the men whe company, and owing to the fear of had gone out of the service of the personal violence on the part of many others, the number of passengers at that time was comparatively small. The cars run during the day were .Sufficient to carry all who de - sired to ride. Owing to the danger of operating the cars at night, that service was not fully restored when the hearing closed Assuming that the company then needed additional men, the ques tion to be determined is, — has the Commission power to order the rein statement of the discharged employees as prayed? The source of the Commission' ment of 1906, Section 19-s, Article follows: power is the constitutional amend- V of the Constitution, which is as "The powers and duties of regulation of rates, service and such Commission shall include the general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation, the Commission s'hall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." An amendment once adopted becomes an integral part of the Con stitution, and the whole instrument must be considered as though all adopted at one time.

If it be within its province to require a carrier to retain a certain employee or to reinstate one already discharged, it must have a correlative power to force an unwilling employee to remain in the service or to require him to return to such service if he has vol - untarily left it. Such a power wculd be a plain violation of the guaran - ties of liberty and property as provided in Section 1 of the Constitution; under the Constitution the Railway Commission has no power to require an employer to retain a particular employee, nor can it require an un - willing employee to remain in Service. It must not be inferred that there is an unlimited right on the part of the employees to quit the service, or on the part of the carrier to dis - charge its employees. All contract rights flowing from such relation are fully protected by the courts, and in the present instance some of the employees who have remained with the company for a sufficient period of time to entitle them to certain advantages and perquisities might if wrongfully discharged have a cause of action against the company. This, however is a matter over which we have no jurisdiction, and only refer to it to avoid misunderstanding. Our views as to the powers of the Commission to reinstate em - ployees, both those discharged by the company and those quitting vol - untarily, are fully sustained by the authorities. In Adair vs. United State.-:. 208 U. S. 161, 52 Law Ed. 436, an act of Congress making it a criminal offense against the United States for an agent or officer of an interstate carrier having full authority in the premises from his princi - pal to discharge an employee from the service of such carrier because of his membership in a labor organization, was held to be in violation of the fifth amendment of the Federal Constitution providing that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. In that case the defendant, Adair. who was' an agent of an interstate carrier, discharged an employee of the company because of his member - ship in a union. After considerable discussion Justice Harlan sums up as follows: "May Congress make it a criminal offense against the United States— as, by the 10th Section of the act of 1898, it does — for an agent or officer of an interstate carrier, having full authority in the premises from the carrier, to discharge an employee from service simply because of his membership in a labor organization? • * • "The first inquiry is whether the part of the 10th section of the act of 1898 upon which the first count of the indictment was based is repugnant to the 5th Amendment of the Constitution, declaring that no person .s'hall be deprived of liberty or property without due process of law. In our opinion that section, in the particular men - tioned, is an invasion of the personal liberty, as well as of the right of property, guaranteed by that Amendment." The 5th Amendment of the Federal Constitution is almost verbatim the same as Section 3 of the Constitution of Nebraska, which provides that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law," </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 139 Quoting Justice Marian again: "While as already suggested, the right of liberty and property guaranteed' by the Constitution against deprivation without due pro - cess of law is subject to such reasonable restraints as the common good or the general welfare may require, it is not within the func - tions of government— at least, in the absence of contract between the parties' — to compel any person, in the course of his business and against his will, to accept or retain the personal services of another, or to compel any person, against his will, to perform personal serv - ices for another. The right of a person to sell his labor upon such terms as he deems proper is, in its essence, the same as the right of the purchaser of labor to prescribe the conditions upon which he will accept such labor from the person offering to sell it. So the right of the employee to quit the service of the employer, for what - ever reason, is the same as the right of the employer, for whatever reason, to dispense with the services of such employee. It was the legal right of the defendant, Adair, — however unwise such a course might have been, — to discharge Coppage because of his being a mem - ber of a labor organization, as it was the legal right of Coppage, if he saw fit to do so. — however unwise such a course on his part might have been, — to quit the service in which he was engaged, because the defendant employed some persons who were not members of a labor organization. In all such particulars the employer and the employee have equality of right, and any legislation that disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in a free land." In Coppage vs. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1, 59 Law Ed. page 441, which was a case involving a statute of the state of Kan.-'as declaring it to be un - lawful to coerce, require, demand or influence any person to enter into any agreement not to join a labor organization as a condition of secur - ing employment or continuing in employment, Coppage, the defendant, who was a superintendent of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, dis - charged a switchman employed by that company because he would not agree to withdraw from a switchmen's union as a condition to his re - maining in the service of the company. Coppage was thereupon arrested and prosecuted. In that case, Adair vs. U. S., cited supra, is approved. The court, Justice Pitney rendering the opinion, used this language: "Under constitutional freedom of contract, whether either party has the right to treat as sufficient ground for terminating the employment, where there is no stipulation on the subject, he has the right to provide against by insisting that a stipulation respecting it shall be a sine qua non of the inception of the employment, or of its continuance if it be terminable at will." And Further: "It is said in the opinion of the state court that membership in a labor organization does not necessarily affect a man's duty to his employer; that the employer has no right, by virtue of the relation, 'to dominate the life nor to interfere with the liberty of the em - ployee in matters that do not lessen or deteriorate the service;' and that 'the statute implies' that labor unions are lawful and not in - imical to the rights of employers.' The same view is presented in the brief of counsel for the state where it is said that membership in a labor organization is the 'personal and private affair' of the employee. To this line of argument it is sufficient to say that it can- </seg>
            <seg id="p138">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 140 not be judicially declared that membership in such an organization has no relation to a member's duty to his employer; and therefore, if freedom of contract is to be preserved, the employer must be left at liberty to decide for himself whether such membership by his employee is consistent with the satisfactory performance of the duties of employment. "Of course we do not intend to say, nor to intimate, anything inconsistent with the right ot individual? to join labor unions, nor do we question the legitimacy of such organizations so long as they conform to the laws of the land as others are required to do. Con - ceding the full right of the individual to join the union, he has no inherent right to do this and still remain in the employ of one who is unwilling to employ a union man, any more than the same in - dividual has a right to join the union without the consent of that organization. Can it be doubted that a labor organization — a volun - tary assocaition of working men — has the inherent and constitutional right to deny membership to any man who will not agree that during such membership he will not accept or retain employment in com - pany with non-union men? Or that a union man has the constitu - tional right to decline proffered employment unless the employer will agree not to employ any non-union man? In all cases we refer, of course, to agreements made voluntarily, and without coercion or duress as between the parties. And we have no reference to ques - tions of monopoly, or interference with the rights of third parties or the general public. These involve other considerations, respect - ing which we intend to intimate no opinion.) And can there be one rule of liberty for the labor organization and its members, and a different and more restrictive rule for employers? We think not; and since the relation of employer and employee is a voluntary re - lation, as clearly as is that between the members of a labor organiza - tion, the employer has the same inherent right to prescrbe the terms' upon which he will consent to the relationship, and to have them fairly understood and expressed in advance." The latest expression of the Supreme Court of the I'nited States is found in Hitchman Coal &amp; Coke Co. vs. Mitchell et al. Advance Sheets. Law Ed. 62, page 96. which Was a suit to obtain an injunction to restrain defendants, some of whom were organizers of a labor union, from in - terfering with the relation existing between plaintiff and its employees'. The organizers of the union were attempting to induce employees of the plaintiff company to become members of the union and still stay in the employ of the company where the contract between the two forbade the employees from remaining in the employ of the company under such circumstances. The injunction wai district court's decision was revere whose opinion in turn was reversed States. The court. Mr. Justice Pit following language: allowed by the district court; the ed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, by the Supreme Court of the United lev rendering the decision, uses the "That the plaintiff was acting within its lawful rights in em - ploying its men only upon terms of continuing non-membership in the United Mine Workers of America is not open to question.

The same liberty which enables men to form unions, and through the union to enter into agreements,' with employers willing to agree, entitles other men to remain independent of agree with to employ no man w to the union. In the latter cas he union and other employers to &gt; owes any allegiance or obligation i the former, the parties are entitled to be protected by the 1 w in the enjoyment of the benefits any lawful agreement they may make.

"Plaintiff, having in the exercise of its undoubted rights estab - lished a working agreement between it and its employees, with the free assent of the latter, is entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of the resulting status, as in any other legal right. That the em - ployment was 'at will,' and terminable by either party at any time, is of no consequence. In Truax vs. Raich, 239 U. S. 33, 38, this court ruled upon the precise question as follows: 'It is said that the bill does not show an employment for a term, and that under an employ - ment at will the complainant could be discharged at any time for any reason or for no reason, the motive of the employer being imma - terial. The conclusion, however, that is sought to be drawn is too broad. The fact that the employment is at the will of the parties, respectively, does not make it one at the will of others. The em - ployee has manifest interest in the freedom of the employer to ex - ercise his judgment without illegal interference or compulsion, and by the weight of authority, the unjustified interference of third per - sons is' actionable although the employment is at will." (Citing many cases.)" There was a dissent by three judges, the dissenting opinion being rendered by Justice Brandeis, but there is no disagreement as to the proposition before us. The following language is used by Justice Bran - deis 1 : "In other words, an employer, in order to effectuate the closing of his shop to union labor may exact an agreement to that effect from his employees. The agreement itself being a lawful one, the employer may withhold from the men an economic need — employ - ment — until they assent to make it. Likewise an agreement closing a shop to non-union labor being lawful, the union may withhold from an employer an economic need— labor— until he assents to make it." It has been the policy of the Commission to recognize established working agreements' between carriers and their employees so long as such agreements do not result in impaired service. When either party seeks to change such an agreement and the change might reasonably be expected to lessen the efficiency oi the service, it is the duty of the party seeking to make the change to apply to the Commission for authority therefor. In the ahsence of such an application under such circum- </seg>
            <seg id="p140">142 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT stances, it is the constitutional duty of the Commission to initiate pro - ceedings for the purpose of detcnntntac proper working conditions. All parties, the public included, would then have full opportunity to be heard, and a just determination tould be reached, with the right of any party to appeal. Sucu a hearing, held before violent feeling became en - gendered, would of itself go far toward establishing a complete and friendly understanding between the carriers and their employees, and would indirectly as well as directly minimize the probability of a strike. The Commission is over charged with the obligation to maintain just ba&amp;'is of employment between carriers aud their employees, to the end that at all times the operations of the carriers may be properly main - tained and the public be protected in its rights to uninterrupted and adequate service. It follows that under the provisions of the constitution of Nebraska and the authorities cited, the Commission has no jurisdiction to grant the prayer of the complaint for the reinstatement of the discharged em - ployees, and it should be dismissed. At the time of the close of the hearing the day service of the com - pany had been restored sufficiently to care for the traffic. The night serv - ice at that time had not been fully restored, due largely to the danger of operating the cars. That part of the complaint relating to the inadequacy of the service was practically abandoned in the hearing. Under the cir - cumstances we do not deem it necessary to make any finding or order upon that part of the complaint. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com- KSion that the complaint herein be and the same is hereby dismissed.

The first requisite of an opinion determining a con - troversy is a true and fairly complete statement of the material testimony. The majority opinion falls considerably short of this measure.

Members' of the union committee who presented the demands to President Sharp of the company testified that Sharp refused to discuss </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 143 or consider any of them, which is corroborated by Sharp himself. He says at page 892 of the record: "This committee that called upon me at that time presented to me the first contract, defendant's exhibit 1; this was presented to me in the afternoon of April 17 (the second day previous to the strike). The committee that waited on me at that time, when they came I supposed was a committee representing the employees of the company. If I remember rightly Mr. Cooper (president of the union) presented this document to me; we were all sitting in a circle around my table in the executive office of the Traction company, and he was sitting on the north side, the paper was folded up like this, and he came over to my table and dropped it on the table and says "look over that and see if you will ngn it," and I opened it up and as soon as I opened it I found that the first clause of it provided that it was a memorandum of agreement to be entered into between the Lincoln Traction company and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Companies of America, Division 744 of Lincoln, and sat there and read it through; when I got through reading it I told the committee that under no circumstances would I recognize that committee as a committee from the employes of the Lincoln Traction company; that they only represented a certain portion of the em - ployees of the Lincoln Traction company; that the officer* of the company would under no circumstances enter into any kind of an agreement with a portion of the employees of the company; that whatever action we took would be taken between the entire list of employees and the company and not with a faction of them; there - fore I would discuss the memorandum of agreement present at all, and I refused to discuss it and refused to consider it in any way; some of the others in the meeting (members of the union committee) called attention to certain sections of it and discussed it in a casual way. but I refused under any circumstances to discuss the provisions of this draft or memorandum of agreement by those who had joined the Association." This position of the company was maintained without deviation up to and during the strike. Sharp testified at page 917 of the record that he replied to a second proposition from the union: "Gentlemen, there is no use of my going any further with this (meaning his reading of the proposed agreement beyond the first paragraph which recited the union as one of the parties); under no circumstances will I recognize any committee that is appointed by the union, because under no circumstances a r e we going to recognize the union Division No. 744." The majority say that the employees elected "to take matters into their own hands to force the company to recognize the union and to that n end called a strike." and that the refusal of the company to recognize the union alone caused the strike. What constitutes "recognition of a union" is often the subject of considerable controversy. Fortunate'y in this case we have the writer of the majority opinion (Commissioner Hall) testify - ing as a witness in behalf of the company, and conveying the company's definition of the term. Mr. Hall said, at page 1605 of the record: ' I do not know just what is meant by recognition of the union, whether that means a contract with the union as a union or not but </seg>
            <seg id="p142">144 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT that is my understanding from the offices of the Traction company (after consultation with the company's officer.-,' just previous to the strike) that the Traction company would not enter into contracts with the union as a union That is also the construction placed upon it by President Sharp, who refused to enter into the proposed agreement on th&lt;' ground that the union was a party to it. Was the refusal to recognize the union the, causfe of the strike? The record shows by a great preponderance of the testimony that the union offered in advance of the strike to waive recog - nition of the union and to submit their differences between the union and the company excepting the right of employees to belong to a union, to arbitration. This is corroborated by President Sharp on page 1162 of the record af follows: Q. "Then there was no hope then or now of arbitration with you A. "No hope of their getting arbitration through a committee representing only a portion of the employees of the company And again at page 1182 of the record "I refused to arbitrate in any way, shape or manner with a por- tion of our employes." It was the refusal of the company to arbitrate the differences with the union, not the recognition of the union, that caused the strike. What caus.ted the strike? What were the conditions concerning which arbitration was sought? Not recognition of the union, not hours of labor, not choice of runs, not working conditions, in fact, nothing affecting the service or the revenues of the company. Simply the rein - statement of a few men who, as the majority correctly say, were dis - charged on account of their activity in forming the union. The men who struck are presumed to know wliy they did so. Following is their testi - mony on the subject: Motorman Umphres: Q. "Why did you quit the service of the company?" A. "Simply because I could not look my fellow work - men in the face and s'ee them fired without any cause." Conductor Robinton: Q. "Why couldn't you work any longer?" A. "I walked out in sympathy with them • • • because they were out on protest, protesting against the men being fired." Motorman Rinker: (I) "would be working for the Traction com - pany now if it had not been for the fact that (I) understood and be - lieved that (my) fellow employees were discharged because they had seen fit to join the carmen's union." Conductor Silibee: Q "Why did you strike?" A. "Because my fellow workmen were being discharged." Conductor Littrell: Q, "Why did you suspend employment with the Traction company? A. ''Simply because I saw the men that wtul working discharged from the company when I did not think they had any cause to discharge them." Conducto. Tyler: "When (I) quit the service of the company or suspended work tl was) going to try to help those men back that had been discharged." </seg>

            <seg id="p144">146 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 10th following — fifty-two days after the beginning of the strike. Presi - dent Sharp testified that on April 26th he appealed to the police depart - ment of Lincoln for protection in operating the cars at night, that such protection was given immediately upon the advent of a new mayor on May 8th, and that thereupon all physical disturbance ceased. Many cases of violation are shown to have occurred prior to May 8th, but none there - after. The fact is that the service was not fully restored for wanl of experienced operators. The record shows that about 175 car men are required to give nornia! service and that approximately 190 men are re - quired for the more extensive service given during the summer season. One hundred sixty-three car men were fully employed the day previous to the strike, of which 49 only remained with the company. President Sharp testified that fifty of the new employes taken on after the strike were without previous experience in street car operation. Many of the new men came from cth&lt; r cities in response to newspaper advertisements and at the solicitation of street car companies friendly to the local com - pany — professional strike breakers for the most part. The customary - results as to the service followed. Citizens testified to rough handling of cars and injuries to passengers.', to cars running with no one at the con - troller, to passing over railway crossings without flagging, to ignoring of Safety stops, to obnoxious conduct toward lady passengers, indecencies in public view and smoking cigarettes inside the cars' by the traii'meu, to bunching cars at ends of lines, and to careless, irregular service senerai - ly. One of the car mm was under indictment for the murder of a citizen during the strike. And it is not in evidence that the companj suspended or discharged a single employe from the beginning of the strike down to the close of the hearing. Is it not a travesty under the eircuniiVances lor the majortiy to dismiss the character of the service rendered during ihe strike with this single comment: "the cars run during the day were sufficient to carry all who desired to ride?" And does it not indicate the greatest dereliction of duty on the part of the majority, clmnrd as it is with the power to require adequate service of the company' Such a dis - missal would be justifiable only in a case of hog car shortage. The following facts are shown to exist by an ovorwh aiming pre - ponderance of the evidence: First, the service rendered hv the con.pany at the close of the hearing was inadequate to reasonably accommodate the people to the degree that trie labor of not less than thirty additional competent car men was necessary to give adequate service. The record shows that 190 car men are required to give adequate service during tho summer seac'on, and that only 174 men were at work at the close of the hearing in that season; and of these men at work at least fifteen were guilty or serious violations either of the company's operating mfes or of law. The majority opinion assumes that the company needed additional men and yet grants no relief. I hold that the least that tho. Commission should do under the circumstances' is to order the company forthwith to ring its force of men to full operating strength. The majority say that the Commission has such power and yet they refuse to exercise it. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 Second, the company used ♦'very means in its power excepi arbitra - tion to recruit its operating force to full strength. This was the com - pany's testimony on the Subject and it was not contradicted; and it neither suspended nor discharged a single employe from the beginning of the strike to the close of the hearing. Further, five employes discharged for union activity and about one hundred of the strikers, all presumably competent because of previous service, and nought against any of them as to incompetency, offered at all times subsequent to the filing of the complaint on May 9th, 1917. to go back to work upon such terms as the Commission might fix. The names of fourteen of these men are of record in the persons of the discharged employes and the officers of the union, and becausi of their leadership in organizing and conducting the union, it is fair to a&amp;'sume that they are the most competent of the men offering to work. At least, these discharged employes and officers of the union submitted themselves most completely to the jurisdiction of the Commission and thus made themselves amendable to its mandates, and neither the company nor the remaining strikers can complain against the selection of these fourteen men for special treatment, assuming that the Commission has the power to administer such treatment. Third ; the company is a common carrier subject to regulation as to rates, service and general control by the Commission. Upon these facts and the Commission's regulation antedating the hearing to investigate the company's service "with a view to making and entering of such an order as may be necessary to the maintenance of a proper standard of public service" by the company, I hold that the Commission has the power and it is its duty to direct the company (1) to re-employ the five men discharged for union activity and the nine officers of the union, naming them; (2) to discharge each and every em - ploye shown to be guilty of violating an operating rule of the company or the law, and to employ in their stead the requisite number of strikers; and (3) to cease discriminating against members of the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway employees of America in em - ploying men for public service. The majority say that the Commission lacks the power to make such an order because (1) it involves the "internal management" of the com - pany which is prohibited to regulatory commissions; (2) it amounts' to taking the property of the company without due process of law; and (3) it amounts to enforced servitude of the men whom the company is di - rected to employ. Dealing with these objections in the order stated: No authority is cited in support of the first objection. True, gome courts have said that regulatory commissions' cannot interfere with the internal management of a public utility, but the statement is found in a general way only, with - out any definition as to its boundaries; and the opinion in which it ap - pears did not deal with the service of the utility.

Examples of interference with the internal management of public utilities by commissions are the building of depots and sidings, the run- ning of additional trains, the maintenance of suitable highway crocking and danger signals, the construction of bridges over running streams in particular ways, the hours of depot service, public notice of service of- fered, the character of telephone service, whether it be grounded, me tallic. magneto or common battery interchange of service with other companies, replacement of spn-itic instruments and property used in the service, building of additional telephone lines necessary to serve residents of the territory occupied by the utility, furnishing of service to particular IV persons, setting aside from the revenues of certain amounts for the pur pose of maintenance and depreciation, suspension of dividends, limita tions of salaries, and in the case of all utilities.', fixing the amount of capital securities and the rates of interest to be paid thereon and the terms upon which they may be sold; and limitations upon the expenditure of capital funds.

It may not law- fully cease to perform that duty for even one hour. The directors of a private business company may. actuated by private greed or motives of private gain stop business and refuse to employ labor at all unless labor conies down to their conditions, however, dis tres'sing. for such are the existing legal, industrial and social condi- tions.

To quote further Brooklyn H "The company has received franchise of great value from the tate, and had conferred upon it the state's transcendent power of minent domain.

It naturally follows from the decision of the Nebraska court that if the company cannot abandon service on a part of its lines, affecting a few people, comparatively speaking, without the consent of the Com - mission, it cannot abandon as it did in the ins'tant case from twelve to fifty-five per cent of the entile service, affecting all of the people, without such consent, especially where it is within the power of the company to continue the service as before As to the second objection of the majority, that to order the com - pany to employ certain men would deprive it of property without due process of law; doubtless what is meant is not that it would cost the company more in wages to employ certain men (as. 1 there is nothing in the record to support that contention), but rather that the deprivation consists in taking away the right to hire employes of the company's own choosing. The third objection, that of enforced servitude of the men selected by name by the Commission for employment, is really not in the case as the men offer and are willing to render the servica But, assuming that it might appear subsequently that the men refused to enter the service or that they should refuse to remain in the service after entring: both of these objections are effectually disposed of by the case of Wil«cn v. New, 242 V. S. 332, growing out of the Adamson act. This was an act of the Congress specifically fixing the wages' and hours of labor of nearly all railway train employes in the country, and practically requiring the cairiers to hire the employes at work, at the wages and hours prescribed in the act. The carriers were organized as a unit on the one hand and the employes on the other; they would not agree among themselves as to the wages and hours of labor and both s'ides threatened to terminate the employment. The effect of such ter - mination would have been to paralyze the transportation facilities of the country. Congress was led, in the language of the court, "to exert the legislative will for the purpose of settling the dispute and bind both parties to the duty of acceptance and compliance to the end that no individual dispute or condition might bring ruin to the vast interests concerned in the movement of interstate commerce." The court sustained the measure, saying aliter: ' What benefits would flow to society by recognizing the right, because of the public interest, to regulate the relation of employer and employee and of the employees among themselves, and to give to the latter peculiar and special rights safeguarding their persons, protecting them in case of accident, and giving efficient remedies </seg>

The court in the ployees "quasi-public employees" i.e. ise of that right subject to govern - ast mentioned case called the em - public employes with a difference. That difference lies only in the capacity of the employer, he being a private person or corporation instead of the government. The nature of the Service rendered by quasi-public employees is the same as that of public employees, hence, their obligations as to the service must be the same. In this connection it is interesting to note that public officials and employees, from the president down to road overseer, are nowhere in the law given the right of resignation. The Nebraska statute on the Subject, which is a replica of the law of all of the states and of the general government in the premises, provides a method for tendering resignations by public officials but does not make their acceptance man - datory. I am of the opinion that the common law obligation of common carriers; as to service includes employes within its purpose and spirit. The obligation is for the benefit of the public and would fail of its ob - ject if but one party to the service is included. A fair statement of the entire obligation would appear to be a*' follows: A common carrier must furnish service to the reasonably all times when its gross operating direct costs of the service — the i the property; it may not dischargt mon to other employees whose 1 full accommodation of the public at revenues are sufficient to defray the xpense of operating and maintaining an employe for a cause which is com- bor is necessary to the rendition of adequate service, when there is good reason to believe that the dis s within the powers of Congress by dissenting Justice McReynolds leave upon the same londiiion. such rights are necessarily subject to limitation when e. ploynent is accepted in a business charged with a public interes; aud as to which the power to regulate com- merce possessed by 'on rets applied, and the resulting right to fix in case of disagree.,, ent and dispute, a standard of wages, as we have seen necessarily obi; .ned."

This is due, the carriers s'ay. to their inability to maintain sufficient heat within the cars in loading and unloading, to the practical impossibility of determnng whether or not the commodities are frozen in some degree when delivered to them for ship - ment, and to the practice of the shippers in making deliveries in con - veyances that are more or less open to the weather and not heated. All of the carriers object to being required to accept the commodities in question when the temperature is below ten degres abov zero. The Union Pacific asks' that a rule be promulgated to that effect. The record shows that the rule in effect stated a zero temperature with the exception of the Rock Island; that the commoddities in question had been refused in some instances when the temperature was consid - erably higher, but that the rule was adhered to generally; that extra protection is furnished the commodities in cold weather by packing them in double-ply paper and otherwise; that they are taken from warehouses having a temperature of about fifty degree*' and conveyed to freight depots in vans, some of which are open to the weather and some closed, but none of which are heated; that it requires from fifteen to twenty minutes to load and make delivery to the carrier of an average vanload, and that it would be practicable to heat such vans sufficiently to protect against freezing; that it requires about the same length of time for the carrier to receive and stow into cars a vanload of goods, but that no heat can be applied during the process; that the commodities' will stand varying degrees of temperature for varying pe - riods of time without injury from freezing (loose apples at fifteen de - grees above zero in ordinary freight cars for about five hours, twenty degrees for about twenty-four hours, and in refrigerator cars for twenty - four to thirty-six hours at ten degrees below zero if cars are tight, hatches closed, and drain pipes plugged; bananas, however, suffer injury at forty degrees above zero in a comparatively short time, and thirty-two de - grees' above zero will ruin them). The carriers forward the shipments in refrigerator cars for the most part, ordinary box cars being used for the remainder. Heaters are main - tained within the cars when the outside temperature is twenty degrees above zero and below, by means of which it is possible to maintain a temperature of forty degrees when the temperature outside is zero or above. The colder temperatures within the car naturally prevail next to the floors and walls. The Burlington alone among the carriers seek to overcome this cold by equipping their refrigerator cars with false floors, and those not already so equipped are provided with portable floors. It also lines the walls of box cars used in the sterviee with paper. It commences to heat the cars from five to seven hours in advance of loading and tarpaulins are used at the doors during loading. This special car service is provided by all of the carriers from all jobbing points in the state, served by, them but it is once a week only to all territories, and two or three times a week to the more densely populated sections of the state when offerings exceed tli capacity of the regular service.

            <seg id="p156">158 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT The experience above related was under a temperature rule of zero. During the winter of 191*-1917 the Burlington applied a ten-degree-above - zero temperature. The damage claims under this rule were less than half in number of the claims for the corresponding period in 1917-1918 under the zero rule. It appears likely, therefore, that a temperature rule of five degrees below zero would add greatly to the number of claims. Following is a computation of th number of days in each of the months of January, February and December of the four calendar years last past (years combined on which the minimum temperatures at Omaha. Lincoln, and Grand Island were ten degrees above zero, zero, and five degrees beiow zero, based on the reports of the United States Stated in days, 9.6 days' of the month on the average are below ten de - grees above zero, 4.5 days are below zero, and 2.7 days are below five degrees below zero. It is apparent from the record that the carriers are not providing facilities proper in all respects for the transportation of perishable com - modities, nor are they exercising a reasonable degree of diligence in caring for the shipments while in their possession. It is within the power of the carrier to provide refrigerator cars with which to carry on this class of service, to place false floors in all of them, to heat the cars during all of the time perishable commodities are contained in them to a temperature above freezing using tarpauline or curtains at the doors during the process of loading and unloading and to place the shipments in warm rooms at destinations until delivered to consignees. They would thus escape all responsibility for damage to the commodities on account of freezing. This is true at least of temperatures of zero and above. weather Bureau: Days' Below Days Below 10 Degrees Days Below 5 Degrees Omaha Month Above Zero Zero Below Zero January 14-17.

            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 There being a difference of less than two days in the month on the average in the shipper's favor on a five-degrre-below-zero rule as com - pared with a zero rule, and a zero rule permitting of shipments during wenty-five days of the month on the average, the Commission does not f *el warranted in making a rule the result of which will undoubtedly greatly increase the claims for damages. The Commission is of the opinion, however, and so finds, that in the event the special or winter line ear service provided for perishable commodities is' suspended on any day designated by the carrier for such service by reason of a tem - perature below zero either at the point of loading or final unloading of such car, that such service shall be provided on the first day following on which the temperature is above zero at the stations described, as shown or forecasted l»y the reports of the United States' Weather Bureau. The Commission also finds that carriers should provide within thirty days of the effective date of this order, tarpauline or curtains of suf - ficient size to wholly close the car door openings of all cars used in the winter line car service, and that the same shall be in place in said openings at all times during the loading and unloading of said cars.

Blackledge et al., Complainants v Farmers Independent Telephone Company and Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com - pany, Respondents. TEMPORARY ORDER AND FINDINC WILSON, Commissioner: At the conclusion of the hearing held herein in the city of Red Cloud, Nebraska, on the 2nd day of July, 1918 (at which hearing each and every of the parties hereto presented all of the testimony they had to offer bearing upon the issues), counsel for the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company moved the Commission to enter an order permitting that com - pany to sever the trunk line connecting the two exchanges of the com - panies parties hereto, by means of which Ion? distance telephone service is supplied to the subscribers of the Farmers Independent Telephone Company; or, in lieu of such an order, that the Commission make and enter an order to the effect that neither of said companies be permitted to take over any of the other company's subscribers, excepting eighty-five persons or corporations who discontinued the service of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company during October, 1917, until the matter involved herein is finally determined. It appears from the record that the Farmers Independent Telephone Company, hereinafter called the Farmers Company, is rapidly extending its plant so as to cover the entire city of Red Cloud, and is converting the same to a common battery system, thus duplicating all of the local exchange plant of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, here - inafter called the Lincoln Company, and placing the Farmers Company plant on a parity with the Lincoln Company's plant as to service. The Lincoln Company contends, and the Farmers Company admitted through its secretary who was its sole witness, that one of the effects of this duplication would be to secure for the Farmers- Company practically all of the local telephone service in the city of Red Cloud, if the Lincoln Company was required to maintain physical connection between its own telephone lines and the lines of the Farmers Company. This would take away all of the local exchange business of the Lincoln Company and render its plant of no value as a going concern. It also appears that the Lincoln Company lost eighty-four of Its local exchange subscribers in Red Cloud on or about the month of Oc - tober, 1917, as a result of the agreement of the Farmers Company with those subscribers to extend and convert its plant as aforesaid. The Commission at this time expresses' no opinion as to the sever - ance of long distance telephone connection between the companies, but it is impressed with the idea that to require such connection without pro - tecting the local exchange business of the Lincoln Company will amount </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Complainant is a partnership consisting of Lester E. Highland and J. L. Highland. It owns an elevator at Giltner which is managed by Lester E. Highland. This elevator was purchased by complainant in April, 1917, and has been operated by them since that time. There are two other elevators operated at Giltner, one by the Hynes Grain Com - pany and the other by the Farmers Grain Company. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 163 Effective January 12, 1918, this Commission promulgated rules for the distribution of cars for grain loading at stations on the lines of the defendant in this state. These rules provide that the cars shall be ap - portioned between shippers at the station according to two factors: first, the number of cars handled by each shipper during the calendar year 1917; second, the amount of grain tendered the carrier for shipment on the last Saturday of each month. Equal weight is given to each factor in determining the apportionment. Under this rule the distribu - tion of cars at Giltner has been as follows: Hynes' Grain Company, 52%; Highland Grain Company. 22^ ; and Farmers Grain Company, 267r. Complainant now objects to this distribution and asks that it be changed so as to require the defendant to furnish an equal number of cars to each grain company at that point. It is contended that com - plainant having operated at Giltner for only a portion of the year 1917, was unable because of the change in the management and the necessity of building up the business to ship as much grain as it is now able to do. It Is further alleged that complainant now has on hand as much corn as either of its competitors and that such corn, not being in condition to keep in the elevator because of its large moisture content, should be moved at once in order that complainant may be protected from loss. Evidence at the hearing was confined principally to three points, the amount of grain on hand in each elevator, the amount of grain tendered by the fanner to each elevator for sale, and the number of cars furnished by defendant. On the day of hearing the elevators had on hand the following amount of grain: Highland Grain Company, 14,300 bushels, 8,100 bushels of which was oats 6,000 bushels of corn and 59 bushels of wheat; Hynes Grain Company, 30,691 bushels, 25,712 bushels of which was oats, 3,612 bushels of corn and 1,367 bushels of wheat; Farmers Grain Company, 16,426 bushels. 10,665 bushels of which was oats, 4,356 bustiels of corn and 1,405 bushels of wheat. Statements were submitted subsequent to the hearing giving the names of farmers who had made tenders of grain to each of the grain companies in Giltner. These statements indicate that there has been tendered to the Highland Grain Company many thousands of bushels of grain. In point of number of farmers the showing of complainant is larger than that of its competitors. With reference to the amount of grain offered, however, the situation is reversed. It is not at all con - clusive from the showing thus made that the Highland Grain Company "would be able to ship a greater proportion of grain than is represented by business done last year. It is apparent from the record that at no time since January 9 has complainant had in its elevator a larger amount of grain than either of its competitors. During this' period, how - ever, the Hynes Grain Company has had practically twice as much grain in its elevator as has complainant, while the Farmers Grain Company has had an equal amount and at the time of the hearing had somewhat greater than complainant. Under the rules promulgated by the Com - mission the fact that complainant has as much or more corn as either </seg>
            <seg id="p162">164 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT of its competitors has no bearing in determining the apportionment of can). The Commission has given careful consideration to this complaint for the reason that it presents a situation not infrequent in the state, namely, the change of ownership of an elevator and the consequent potential change in the volume of business because of different business methods employed or for other reasons. In view of the facts as they have been developed by this investigation, however, the Commission is of the opinion that it would not be justified in modifying the rules for the distribution of cars as they have been promulgated. It is obvious that no rule or set of rules for the apportionment of cars between ship - pers can be absolutely just and equitable, and it is possible that com - plainant in this instance may be entitled to a slightly larger number of cars than the rules now give him. But the increase, if any were to be allowed, would be so small as to not justify a departure from the rules. There is no complaint that defendant has not followed the order of the Commission. On the contrary the record shows the distribution by the agent of the Burlington has been made in exact accordance with the rules laid down by the Commission. It follows, therefore, that the complaint should be dismissed ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint bo and the same hereby is dismissed.

The real question to be determined here is as to whether conditions in the grain business at Benedict have so changed by reason of the transfer of ownership of one of the elevators as to justify a departure from the rule promulgated by this Commission. The question of the reasonableness of the rules as a whole has already been decided by this Commission in its General Order Noll, and needs no further discussion here. It may be said in that connection, however, that the broad prin - ciple upon which those rules are based is that of providing as nearly as may be possible for a continuation during periods of car shortage of the normal flow of business as it exists 1 when cars may be had upon the demand of any shipper. In other words, the rules are designed to secure an apportionment of cars during shortage in the same manner as they would be apportioned if there were no shortage. It does not appear from this record that complainant is being subjected to any re - strictions by the rules that would not obtain under normal conditions. It is admitted that the management of the business since May, 1917, has not changed. The same local manager has been in charge since that time, and Mr. Tanner, the controlling stockholder now, has been identified with the company at all times, although not until November assuming personal supervision of the station. It is not stoown that the policy of the management has changed in any degree, nor does the record indicate that it is any more aggressive than was the Van Winkle Lumber Company, to whose business it succeeded, for of the fifty-three cars shipped from the elevator during 1917 forty-two were handled by the Van Winkle company up to May 18th, leaving only eleven cars to com - plainant for the remaining seven months of the year. While there was some shortage during the summer months, it is clear from the record that the dealers were able to get about all the cars they required. It is significant that during that time the Fanners Association shipped 113 cars while complainant shipped only 11 cars up to January 1st. To the claim that complainant has been compelled to turn away grain because of its inability to get cars, it must be answered that the Farmers Associa - tion has had the same experience. The manager of that elevator testi - fied that he had been compelled to turn many wagon loads of grain from his scales because of his inability to handle it. Both concerns, according to statements submitted at the request of the Commission, have large amounts of grain bargained for and yet to be delivered. The Farmers Association has also had some of its sales cancelled because it has been unable to deliver the grain within the specified time. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 167 These things indicate that both concerns have been laboring under the same disability and thai the disadvantage to which complainant has been subjected has not been due to the method of distributing cars at Benedict but to the car stringency which prevails throughout the state. In the opinion of the Commission the grounds of the complaint have not been established, and it should be dismissed. It developed at the hearing that the agent of defendant in arriving at the number of cars shipped by each elevator during 1917 had made an error. In his calculation he used 43 cars as being the shipments made from the elevator now owned by complainant and 217 ears as being shipped by the Farmers Association. The figures should have been 53 cars for complainant and 207 for the Farmers. Technically, complainant under the rules should be bound by the number of cars actually shipped during the time it has been in business, theoretically extended to cover the entire year. In view, however, of the marked difference in the volume of shipments of the two concerns, and as an allowance for any possible disabilities that complainant may have experienced because of the conditions at that s'tation, the shipments as made from that elevator by both firms operating the same will be taken into the calculation. I'sing the amount of grain on hand at the time of the hearing as a basis, we have the following: Amount of Cars Shipped in 1917 Ratio Farmers 207 79.67, Tanner 53 20.3';; Grain on hand (Bushels) Ratio Farmers 33,923 67.72&lt;7&lt; Tanner 16,165 32.27&lt;% Averaging percentages according to the rules, we have a ratio of 3.5% for the Farmers and 26.28', for the complainant. Distribution should be made on this basis during February, but the ratio should be changed at the end of the month to correspond with the changes in the amounts of grain tendered for shipment.

Due to the shortage of cars he estimated that 257t of the grain in Chap - pell territory went to- nearby towns. It is impossible to determine how much business each of these firms could have done had they secured all the cars they needed. It is obvious, however, that no settled basis for the distribution of cars at this station was adopted by the railroad company, the rules of the Commission did not become effective until after January first, and the company appears to have tried two methods, viz., that of grain on hand, and that of ability to load quickly. If the first method had been adopted and strictly ad - hered to, the apportionment would have approximately been two to the Farmers Company and one to the complainant. While the amount of grain held by each varied from lime to time, the relative proportion ap - pears to have remained about the same. Objection is made by com - plainant to a consideration of the grain placed in the new portion of the Farmers elevator, on the theory that it could not be loaded directly into cars, but if we reject that grain we will for the same reason be com - pelled to reject the amount stored by complainant in its coal bin. Grain in an elevator that can be transferred to cars by means of wagons is, in our opinion, ready for shipment. The distribution by defendant accord- Ing to the ability of each elevator to load quickly, is, in the opinion of the Commission, not an equitable method. Shippers of grain should load cars in such a manner as to not unnecessarily delay them. But when the loading is done within a 24-hour period there can be no equity in using the spout capacity of an elevator as the measure for determining how many cars that elevator should have. For that reason the use by defendant of this method during a considerable portion of the period under controversy cannot be regarded as representative of an equitable distribution. While it is very difficult to determine just what the distribution be - tween these two elevators should have been during the latter part of 1917, the Coir.-.nission is of the opinion, after a consideration of all the circumstances involved, that the distribution as between the two ele - vators for the period from August 15, 1917, to January 1, 1918, should have been in the ratio of two to the Farmers Company and one to the complainant. We are further of the opinion that the volume of ship - ments for 1917, which under the rules of the Commission, now in force, constitutes one of the factors in determining the apportionment between shippers, should be readjusted to the basis just suggested, and that the ratio from henceforth should be based on such readjustment. Upon request of the Commission the local agent of defendant has submitted a statement of the grain on hand in each elevator, as reported to him by the parties on January 28, 1917, this statement being as fol - lows: Farmers Elevator Company 30,356 bushels, or 70% Peuc County Elevator Company 13,052 bushels, or 30% </seg>

            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 173 OPINION AND FINDINC TAYLOR, Commissioner Complainant is engaged in the gi Creek, Nebraska. In the conduct of t purchased corn from his customers, weighed on the scales of either the 1 the Central Granaries Company, the that point. Last year, however, coi ;eneral merchandise business at Elk that business he has in recent years Until last year, such grain was armers' Cooperative Association or two established grain dealers at iplaiuant installed his own wagon jr the grain business in a general crib adjacent to defendant's right- scales and last fall concluded to ent way. He has no elevator, but has on&lt; of-way with a capacity for about 3,00 bushels of ear corn. Back of his' store in Elk Creek, and 360 feet distant from the track, he has another crib which has been converted into a granary and which has a capacity for about 3,000 bushels of shelled corn. On his farm a quarter of a mile from the loading tracks he has cribs and granaries, which he estimates will hold 2,800 bushels of ear corn and 7,000 bushels' of shelled corn. Complainant charges that during the past grain shipping season de - fendant has failed and refused to furnish him with the necessary number of cars with which to move his grain and that it has discriminated against him in that it has furnished to the two elevators' more cars than it has furnished him. He contends- that under the law and the rules for the distribution of cars, as promulgated by this Commssion, he is entitled to as many cars as are being furnished the other dealers at that point. The question to be determined here is whether or not complainant is a "regular shipper" within the meaning of the rules as laid down by this Commission and whether or not as such "regular shipper" he is in pos - session of an "elevator, warehouse, or mill," as referred to in said rules. Chapter 221, Laws of 1917, repeals all statutes with reference to distribution of cars by the railroads operating in Nebraska and imposes upon the Nebraska State Railway Commission the duty of promulgating rules for the apportionment of cars between divisions, stations, and ship - pers, subject to certain conditions prescribed in the act. For the purpose of this controversy, Sections 4, 5. and 10 are herewith set out: Section 4. Whenever the Commission, after hearing either on its own initiative or on formal complaint, shall determine that the supply of cars on any railroad is not adaquate, in any respect, the Commission shall issue an order requiring that after a date named in such order all cars distributed on such railroad s"hall be appor - tioned by the railroad company operating the said railroad, to di - visions of such railroad, to stations thereon, and to shippers at such stations only in accordance with a rule or set of rules which the Commission is hereby required to formulate and establish. Section 5. Any rule or set of rules formulated and established under this act shall provide: First, that the apportionment of cars between different divisions of the railroad affected by such rule or rules shall be determined *y the relative volume of shipments of freight made from each of such divisions'. Second, that the apportionment of cars between the several sta - tions on a division of the railroad affected by such rule or rules shall </seg>
            <seg id="p172">174 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT d by the relaiive volume of shipments of freight made each of such stations l'hird, that the apportionment of cars between shippers at any station on the railroad affected by such rule or rules shall be de - termined by the relative volume of shipments of freight made by each of such shippers, provided that no shipper shall be deprived of his due proportion of cars. Fourth, the method to be used in determining the relative olume of shipments of freight made from a division, from a station or by a shipper. Fifth, that when necessity is found to exist, of which the Com - mission is advised either by its own investigation which it may make at any time or by hearing on complaint of any shipper or railroad company, the Commission will by special order require the railroad company on whose railroad such necessity is found to exist to depart, to the extent provided in such order, from the application of this act or any rule or rules formulated and established under the same. Section 10. The Commission shall have full authority to formu - late and establish any and all rules which it may deem necessary for the carrying out of the intent of this act. Pursuant to the provisions of this law, the Commission conducted extended hearings in May, 1917, and on December 22, 1917, issued an order in which were embodied rules for the apportionment of cars for the loading of grain and mill products. Owing to abnormal conditions, brought about by the war, and which it is not necessary here to discuss, the rules were directed only to the distribution of cars as between shippers. These rules define "shippers," "regular shippers," and "mis - cellaneous shippers" as follows: A "shipper" shall mean any ptrs'on, firm, company, association or corporation in Nebraska offering grain or mill products in carload lots to be carried over the railroad in accordance with the pro - visions of the official tariffs of the carriers. Shippers shall be divided into "regular shippers' and "miscel - laneous shippers." A "regular shipper" is any person, association, firm or corpora - tion established at a station and in possession of an elevator, ware - house, or mill in which grain or mill products are stored preparatory to transportation thereof by railroad, who has made shipments of such commodities in carload lots at frequent intervals' from such station for one month or more immediately preceding the date of his classification. A "miscellaneous shipper" shall be every shipper of grain or mill products from a station other than a "regular" shipper. In an informal ruling made previous to the filing of this complaint, the Commission held that Mr. Somberg was not a "regular shipper" and that he was entitled only to his proper proportion of cars as a "miscel - laneous shipper." It is now necessary to determine from this record whether he is a "regular shipper," and that question turns largely on the point as to whether he operates a warehouse within the meaning of the rules as above set forth. It is admitted at the outset that Mr. Somberg has neither a mill nor </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 an elevator. He contends, however, that the cribs and bins in which his corn is stored are warehouses and that from them he is able to load into cars within twenty-four hours from the time the cars are stet for loading, which is as soon as is necessary under the conditions under which de - fendant operates its trains. K is admitted that either of the elevators can load cars in a few hours and because of their facilities could load several cars a day. In the opinion of the Commission, a warehouse, within the meaning of the rules, is a building suitable for storing grain in condition for transportation, located either upon or immediately adjacent to the right - of-way of the railroad. It should have sufficient capacity to hold all the grain tendered for shipment and it should be so constructed and equipped as to permit of prompt loading of cars. Its proximity to the tracks should be such as,' to make the wo x of loading practically independent of weath - er conditions. If a man &lt; :cp :cts to permanently engage in the buying and i hipping of grain, he t'-.oi.id also expect to provide adequate facilities for the receiving and deli ering of such grain. Where he relies upon hauling his grain from v. rloua distances and from various places by wagon, he is certain 10 encounter delays through inclement weather, bad roads, and other causes. It. sorely is not unreasonable to require him to provide a warehouse i.i which to store his grain and from which he can promptly load it in.o cars. During periods of acute car shortage, such as has prevailed tlrs year, the prompt loading and unloading of box cars is highly essential. In State ex rel McComb vs. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 71 Neb. 593. the supreme ccurt of this s'tate, in considering a case very similar to the one at bar, said: "It is clear that an individual loading grain into cars by shoveling the same from wagons, other things being equal, has not the ability to load as many cars in a day as a well-equipped elevator." • • * "It further appears that the railroad company prefers to have the grain shipped from elevators, and that Mr. McComb received some - thing less than his fair proportion of cars, but, under no view of the evidence that we have been able to take, can we say he was at the time this action was begun entitled to the number of cars he asks." Under the definition of a warehouse as we have stated it, it is apparent that Mr. Somberg is unable to qualify as a "regular shipper." He has a number of cribs and small bins, only one of which is in prox - imity to the loading tracks', this being a crib filled with ear corn. The large portion of his grain is a quarter of a mile or more from the loading point. If this grain is to be considered as ready for tender to the carrier, then the grain on every farm in that community is entitled to the same privilege. Grain one mile or two miles from the station is as much en - titled to consideration as grain one-fourth of a mile from the station. If the amount of grain in an "elevator, mill, or warehouse offered for ship - ment" is to be considered as a factor in the apportionment of cars' be - tween shippers, and it is so considered by the Commission's rules, it is manifest that there must be some well defined rule as to when grain is subject to tender. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">176 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT In this connection it is,' well to direct attention to another feature of Mr. Somberg's situation. According to the record, complainant had on hand March 2, 10,607 bushels of grain, 5.500 bushels of which was shelled corn, 4,507 bushels of ear corn, and 500 bushels of oats. It will be noted that almost half of this grain was ear corn. This corn was not in condi - tion for transportation as 1 it had to be shelled. The Commission has held that when grain is tendered for shipment it must be in the condition in which it is desired to transport it. To hold otherwise would lead to endless complications. If we were to say that corn which is unshelled was ready for shipment, it would be as logical to assert that corn yet unhusked could be tendered, or that wheat or other »*mall grain still to be threshed could be offered. In determining the amount of grain offered for shipment it is absolutely essential that some uniform requirement as to the form of the grain so tendered must be established. Otherwise, a "regular shipper," in order to secure a larger proportion of cars, could offer grain in any form, whether it was in condition to ship or not, and thus make it difficult if not impossible to establish any positive or de - pendable regulatons for the distribution of cars. The Commission is of the opinion, therefore, and so finds that com - plainant is not a "regular shipper" within the meaning of the rules pro - mulgated by this Commission by virtue of its authority under Chapter 221, Laws of Nebraska for 1917, but that he is a "miscellaneous shipper" within the meaning of said rules and that as such he has' not been discriminated against in the distribution of cars by defendant.

The constitutional guarai due process of law supersedes the devolves upon the Commission und determine the division. Respondent well afford to offer a division of fee statute in such cases, and it then jr its general regulatory powers to alleges that the complainant "could which would be remunerative with defendant, or at least the twenty-five per cent which he allows to the Arnold telephone exchange." It is' to be inferred, therefore, that re - spondent would be satisfied with twenty-five per cent of the revenues. An equitable division, however, would be to allocate to the complainant so much of the charge as is necessary to maintain the toll line and pay a fair return upon its cost, and divide the remainder between the parties in equal proportions. The loss, if any, occurs in operating the service, and the parties contribute equally to this work. The record shows that the average cost of maintaining the toll line is $10 per annum, and that a return of seven per cent per annum on the cost allocated to the Stapleton-Gandy toll line of $70 would be approx - imately $5.00 per annum. To this should be added about $10 per year for deferred depreciation, making a total for maintenance, return and de - preciation of $25 per annum. Deducting this $25 from the total annual revenues of $226 leaves approximately $200 for division between the the parties, or for all purposes, fifty-five per cent of the revenues to the complainant and forty-five per cent to the respondent, which division the Commission finds to be reasonable and proper in the premises'. The toll charge, however, should be fifteen cents if it is not paid during the month in which it is incurred. The present charge does not cover the cost of furnishing the service, and the loss should not be augmented by careless - ness in paying. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the division of revenues derived by either or both the Tri- County Telephone Company and the Gandy Switchboard Company, par - ties herein, from toll telephone messages transmitted over the toll line connecting the exchanges of said parties located in Stapleton and Gandy. Nebraska, be made upon a basis of fifty-five per cent of each and every of such charges to the Tri-County Telephone Campany, and forty-five per cent of each and every of said charges' to the Gandy Switchboard Com - pany. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the charge for toll service between the switchboards of the above named parties located in Stapleton and Gandy, Nebraska, be fifteen cents per message, subject to a discount of five cents per message if paid during the calendar month in which the charge is incurred.

Complainant advises the Commission by letter that it has connected its long distance telephone line with respondent's switchboard in Gandy, Nebraska, but that it intends to sever the same on October 23, 1918, at the village limits of Gandy, Nebraska, and to remove that portion of the line within said limits, offering, however, to make and maintain the con - nection of said line wth the respondent's swtchboard if the respondent will build a telephone line from its exchange to the village limits so as to connect with the complainant's line. No good reason is assigned or shown by the complainant for this contemplated action on its part.

Subsequently, another application was filed asking authority to publish a rate of 10 cents between all of the exchanges of the Farmers Telephone Company and Fremont. This rate was authorized on August 28. 1917. Under its provisions, complainant, Farmers Telephone Company, was routing all calls originating at its various exchanges for Fremont destina - tion over the Webster toll line, and asking that where request was made at Fremont for such routing, reverse calls be sent via this route. To this provision, the Nebraska Telephone Company demurred, and subsequent negotiations ended in the conference in the Commission's office. From the evidence there brought out, it appears that the difficulties would be eliminated if the Farmers Telephone Company had toll rates by way of the Webster exchange equal to the standard toll rates on file with the Commission from those various exchanges to Fremont over the toll lines of the Nebraska Telephone company. The Commission is' of the opinion that an element of discrimination exists where the Farmers Telephone Company has a lower published toll rate between the same points than the Nebraska Telephone Company, and the latter company is required to give connections to the former company on the Fremont exchange, thereby contributing to the demoralization of a certain amount of its own toll business. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the Farmers Tele - phone Company of Dodge County should be required to publish and collect toll charges between all its exchanges, except Webster, and Fremont equal to the published toll rates of the Nebraska Telephone Company. It is further of the opinion that an emergency exists, that an order should forthwith issue, subject to the right of said Farmers Telephone Company to file protest and be granted a hearing on the merits of this' order.

            <seg id="p192">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 194 APPLICATION NO. 3292 In the Matter of the Application of the Lin - coln Traction Company for Authority to Remove Track and Discontinue Service. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner: The Lincoln Traction Company operates two street railway lines from the center of Lincoln to College View, — one by way of South street and the Boulevard, which is generally known as the High Line, the other by way of Sumner street and Normal, which is known as the Low Line. The two lines form a junction at Seventh and L streets in College View. All cars entering College View from the two lines are operated over the same track from Seventh and L down to the business n liter, thence around a loop and back to the city over their respective lines. The distance from Lincoln to College View by way of the High Line is approximately five miles and by way of the Low Line approximately six miles. The application proposes to abandon the service on the Low Line from the center of College View to Fifty-second and Boulevard, a dis - tance of 1.38 miles, and to take up the track from Seventh and L streets, College View, to Fifty-second and Boulevard. This particular part of the Low Line extends north from the junction in College View on L or Forty-eighth street to Van Dorn street, thence east four blocks 1 to Fifty - second street, thence north on Fifty-second street to Boulevard street. The applicant contends that a better service can be rendered the general public in that it will enable the company to reduce its headway from a. forty-minute to a thirty-minute service on the Low Line and will also enable a regular twenty-minute service to be rendered on the High Line. The company also contends that the operation of the cars over the Low Line from Fifty-second and Boulevard into College View is a financial loss to the company and an unnecessary burden upon the rate-paying public in general. The Commission finds that the abandon - ment of the service on the 1.38 miles' will enable the company to render a thirty-minute service on the Low Line from Fifty-second and Boule - vard street and a twenty-minute service on the High Line. The question for the Commission to determine is: Will the patrons of the applicant affected by the abandonment of the service referred to be adequately served if the abandonment is permitted? An extensive hearing was held in the matter and the Commission has made a personal examination of the territory adjacent to the line proposed to be abandoned. At the closte of the hearing the Commission, being of the opinion that a careful traffic study would be necessary, directed that the com- </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 pany and the patrons of the line should make and submit to the Com - mission such studies, and the case was continued for that purpose. The studies have been made ard filed with the Commission. The one made by the citizens of College View is' elaborate and appears to have been painstakingly prepared. It covered a period of ten days, and shows the on and off of all passengers on each particular car for the entire period. In the analysis of the report we will assume that all patrons board - ing the cars in College View and those living three blocks north of the junction referred to and coming into Lincoln as far as Twenty-fifth or Twenty-sixth and Sunnier streets' will be adaquately served by the High Line. For instance, a passenger coming from College View wishing to get off at Twenty-fifth or Twenty-sixth and Sumner can come in on the High Line, get off at Twenty-fifth or Twenty-sixth and South and walk across four blocks to Sumner. The out trip could, of course, be made in the same way. However, the traffic study shows that very few passengers coming from College View get off in that part of the city of Lincoln. Those coining down town into that portion of the city Served by the South Seventeenth street line can transfer at Seventeenth and South. The Commission is of the opinion that the traffic between College View and Lincoln will be adequately served by the High Line. The traffic on the Low Line from Fifty-second and Boulevard will be better served in that they will get a thirty-minute instead of a forty-minute serv - ice. The next question is: What amount of traffic originates in College View with destinations between Fifty-second and Boulevard and Twenty - sixth and Sumner? This can best be determined by an analysis of the on and off of all passengers passing between the two zones. December 7, 1917, showed the heaviest traffic on the entire Low Line for the period for which College View made its study, there being 2,031 passengers carried on the thirty-three round trips made by all cars. The first car left Lincoln at 5:30 a. m. of that date; three passengers ;ot on at Tenth and O streets and one at Thirteenth and N; one got off at Twenty-fourth and Sumner and three at Eleventh and L, College View. The one that got off at Twenty-fourth and Sumner would have under the change proposed a thirty-minute instead of a forty-minute servece to that point. The three that got off in College View could have gone by - way of the High Line. This car on its return trip left College View at 6:00 a. m. and carried a total of forty passengers, eight of which got on in College View, one at Fourth and L, College View, and four at Lamb Station, which is three blocks south of the proposed terminal. Now, we find that on this run the first passenger to get off was,' at Sixteenth and H, Lincoln. If this passenger was one of the eight that got on in College View he could have taken the High Line, transferred at South and Seventeenth, and reached Sixteenth and H by way of the Seventeenth street line. </seg>
            <seg id="p194">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 196 The one that got on at Fourth and L, College View, would have been inconvenienced in that he would have had to walk four blocks south to Seventh and L to reach the High Line. Of the thirty-three out trips on this day the car that let! Lincoln at 5:30 p. m. carried a total of 110 passengers, which was the heaviest traffic carried by any of the cars. All but four of these passengers got on in the down-town district and the four got on before reaching Twenty-fifth and Sumner. When the car left Fifty-second and Boulevard all were off but eleven; two of which got off one block and two three blocks south of the proposed terminal, four got off in the zone to be abandoned, and three got off in College View, who would have been served by the High Line. The four that got off in the zone proposed to be abandoned would be inconvenienced by the proposed change in that they would have to walk more than three blocks to one of the proposed terminals. It will not be necessary to enter into a detailed discussion of the traffic on all cars moving over the line for the period, as the illustrations above given are fairly representative of the entire period. The studies made by both the company and College View conclusively show that a very small per cent of the traffic will be seriously inconvenienced by the proposed abandonment and that the operation of the cars over the Low Line beyond Fifty-second and Boulevard and the terminus in College View is a burden upon the company and an injustice to the rate-paying public as a whole. It is contended that certain parties have built their homes along that portion of the line now proposed to be abandoned and that by the aban - donment of the service a great injustice will be done them. They have no vested right in the service and must be content to yield to that which is an economy in operation and a betterment to the service of the general public. Nor should parties living in sparsely settled territories adjacent to the city complain that street car service is not extended to them until the traffic from such territories, together with the probable develop - ment of traffic within the near future, warrants the investment necessary for such extensions. In Sapulpa v». Sapulpa Electric Interurban Railway Co. the Oklahoma Corporation Commission held: "It is an established principle of law that a public utility, such as an electric line or gas line, cannot be maintained merely for the value which it may add to the property served. Such utilities are intended to serve an entire city or community and the effect of the maintenance of any particular line or portion of the service must be considered in relation to the part it bears to the entire service. Hence, a line which s'erves few patrons, and which is being maintained at a heavy loss, should be discontinued. Otherwise this loss will fall upon the entire city or community and will place an -unnecessary and undue burden upon the entire service, and will make rates therefore necessarily high in order to afford the utility a return on the invest - ment. This does not mean that a utility can select the portions of the city where the runs will be unusually large and neglect all the other portions; or that a community where the prospects of develop - ment are bright and where service will eventually be profitable </seg>

In Thormunn vs. Denver &amp; I. R. Co. tin Colorado Public I'tilit Commission held: "Evidence introduced by property owners to the effect that abandonment of street car service and the removal of street railway tracks will depreciate the value of property, or to the effect that an extension of street railway tracks will appreciate the value of prop - erty, cannot he considered by the Commiss'ion. Every public utility under the jurisdiction of Uie Commission must furnish, provide and maintain such service, instrumentalities, equipment and safety of its patrons, employes and the public, and as shall in all respects be adequate, efficient, just and reasonable; but the Commission has no authority to order an extension of a street railway line because it will enhance the value of property; nor has it the authority to pro - hibit the removal of street railway tracks for the reason that the removal of said tracks will depreciate the value of property. The Commission is not an instrument to aid in increasing real estate values nor to lend assistance to property owners to maintain the present value of their property." The Commission is therefore of the opinion that authority should be granted the applicant to remove that portion of its Low Line extending from Fifty-second and Boulevard street, Normal, to Seventh and L streets, College View, and to abandon the service rendered by the cars over the Low Line from Fifty-second and Boulevard, Normal, to the center of College View. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that the applicant should establish a suitable terminal station at Fifty-second and Boulevard. Said station shall be constructed of cement and enclosed on one side and two ends and provided with sufficient lighting and seating facilities. The floor space of blaid station, in the opinion of the Com mission should be approximately eight feet by twelve feet, the platform facilities at least four feet wide and of ;i length equal to that of the cars run on that line.

The information thus presented plainly indicates that the application should be granted in some measure, and that a complete investigation and hearing are not necessary for that purpose. Applicant's organization dates from September IS, 1908. The capital contributions were as follows: OPINION AND FINDING WILSON, Commissioner: Applicant owns and operate* 1 a telephone plant of two exchanges and serves approximately six hundred subscribers. Its present rates are as follows: Business $1.50 per month Town residence l&lt;&gt;0 per month Kami l-i'O per mouth Extension set, additional 15 per month Desk set, additional 15 per month The following rates arc applied for: Business $2.1)0 per month Town residence, 1-party 1.75 per month Town residence, 2 or more party . 150 per month Karm residence. 2 or more party 1.50 per month Business and residence, 2-party (1 circuit) 3.50 per month Business and residence, 2-party (2 circuits)... 3.75 per month Extension set, additional 25 per month Desk set. additional 25 per month The matter was developed informally witli a view to saving the time and expense required by a formal hearing.

The number lia.-&gt; gradually increased to 60ti, and the additions to plant necessary to serve them have been paid for out of current revenues almost altogether. It Is impossible to determine from the record the amount of revenues so used as the books are not in sufficient detail. The Commission is also ad - vised that there are no records of any nature from which the cost of the plant from the beginning can be determined. Applicant claims a present reproduction new value of $33,861.14 and a present value of $27,146.48. From information contained in the in - ventory as to quantities of property, ape, and kind, the Commission's engineer estimates reproduction new value at $31,821.64, and present value at $23,234.21. It is evident, therefore, that a considerable propor - tion of the plant was paid for out of operating revenues — fully one-half in all probability. Accepting for the purposed of this case, the present value found by the Commission's engineer t $23,234.21). the question is: is the surplus in this value over and above the amount of capital con - tributed plus deferred dividends thereon, sufficient to meet the increased costs of operation now being experienced by applicant and give a reason - able return to stockholders without raising the rates? The difference between the engineer's present value and the capital paid in is $9,284.21. A reasonable return in plants of this size and situated as it is in western Nebraska where interest rates are abnormally high, is S r &lt; per annum. Applying this rate to the capital invested from the beginning, gives.' a total return due of $ll,dl6 Deducting dividends paid of $3,064. results in deferred dividends in the amount of $7,952. Deducting deferred dividends from the difference between present value and the capital invested, results in a surplus of $1,322.21. Applicant reports the cost of replacements during the last five years as follows: $2,078.40 1918 1014 119.30 082.31 1915 1,693.62 i&lt;m»; 1917 14 The abnormal cost in 1915 was due to damage wrought by a severe &amp;'leet storm, and in 1917 to the destruction by fire of its exchange building at Berwyn. Disregarding the extraordinary cost in 1917. which should have been guarded against by insurance, and considering the age of the plant, it is safe to say that not less than $2,500 per annum is now re - quired for replacements, which is about $500 above the normal. On the whole the plant has now lived two-thirds of its estimated age and ex penditures for replacements will continue to increase until all of the original plant except inn wire has been replaced.

Relative to applicant's request for the approval of combination two - party business and residence rates, with a higher rate for service on two circuits than on one, the Commission finds that it would be im - practicable to make such a distinction in the rates. Every subscriber is entitled to ask for service according to the description and rate ap - proved by the Commission, and it would be utterly impracticable to give everyone a single circuit service. The Commission, therefore, approves combination two-party business and residence service over lines with which a third party is not connected a: one rate only, and regardless of the number of circuits involved, the rale to be the sum of the business and one-party residence rates, or $3.50 per month. The Commission also finds that it reasonable to require the appli cant to keep account of disbursements, as follows: (1) Expenditures for operation, in detail as to exchange operators, toll operators, stationery and advertising, light, heat, water and power, rent for buildings, manager service and incidental expenses. (2) Expenditures for maintenance, in detail as' to buildings, central office equipment, aerial equipment, underground equipment, subscriber's stations, utility equipment, toll equipment, livery and stable expenses, and incidental expenses; the salary paid to the secretary-manager to be apportioned to these accounts according to the proportion of his time devoted to the work of maintenance.

Thi» extra charge is in effect on all interstate traffic in this territory, excepting from points in eastern Colorado and Wyoming, and has been upheld as a reasonable charge by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The record indicates that the refrigerator car is generally preferred to ordinary box car for the movement of potatoes and other vegetables during the winter time. In order to move these commodities by ordinary box cars,' during the winter season, it is necessary for the shipper to install a false bottom in the car, line the car with heavy paper, and, during the coldest weather, maintain heat by means of a stove, at an expense of about $75 per car. This results in very substantial discrim - ination against the shipper using box cars which should be removed in some degree at least, though that is not assigned as ground for the ap - plication. The principal commodity affected is potatoes which move in con - siderable quantities from the northwestern part of the state. The prin - cipal carriers affected are the North Western and Burlington roads, the North Western handling in 1916 upwards of 1,200 cars and the Burlington 1,254 cars, of which approximately 50', move intrastate. Were it not for the fact that the rates on potatoes from this territory are comparatively low, the discrimination shown to exist against shippers using box cars should be removed by substantial reduction in the rates. The record shows that the intras'tate movement of potatoes, onions and cabbage is mainly to the cities of Omaha and Lincoln at distance varying from 360 to 495 miles. Class "C" rates to these points vary from 26.7c to 52.1c per hundred pounds, but commodity rates of from 17c to 21.25c are contemporaneously in effect, and the traffic moves under the commodity rates. Prior to the enactment of the Aldrich freight rate law these com - modity rates were 20c to 25c per hundred. They were originally estab - lished at a time when the production of potatoes was,' very small in this state and were made for the purpose of encouraging production. The Aldrich law reduced these rates 15'&gt;; and the reduced rates have since remained in effect. Comparing these rates with the rates in effect in ter - ritory east of the Mississippi river, known as Central Freight Association territory, the Nebraska rates, are seen to be approximately 20% lower than the eastern rates. Following is a table of representative rales in effect for distances of from 360 to 479 miles in Central Freight Association territory: Waupaca, Wis., to Cedar Rapids, Iowa Cambridge, Minn., to Milwaukee Park Falls, Wis., to Chicago Alexandria, Minn., to Des Moines Eau Claire, Wis., to Peoria, 111 Rhinelander, Wis., to Davenport, Iowa Park Falls, Wis., to Des Moines Appleton, Minn., to Milwaukee 360 mi., 22 cents 376 mi., 22.5 cents 376 mi., 22 cents 400 mi., 23 cents 407 mi.. 23 cents 414 mi., 23 cents 452 mi., 23.5 cents 479 mi., 24.5 cents I </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 The Nebraska rales applied to the ton miles' of the commodities in question also shows that they arc low. The net ton per mile runs from 7.81 mills to 9.61 mills,, which approximates the rate on many non - perishable commodities. The Interstate Commerce Commission in 1. &amp; S. Docket No. 141, 25 1. ('.('. 241, dealing with potato rates from points in Ne - braska, South Dakota and other states to eastern points, approved of lates lor distance*' of from 500 to '.(50 miles, which yields a revenue of from seven to ten mills per ton mile ;and it is a well recognized prin - ciple in rate-making that longer distances justify proportionately lower rates than short distances. Other reasons for approving an additional charge for the use of re - frigerator cars are: A 50 r ', greater cost of refrigerator ears over box cars, the carriers get the same per diem on refrigerator cars as on box cars, and a much longer empty haul of refrigerator cars is required than of box cars. Comparatively few refrigerator cars are made empty in the territory affected, whereas box cars' in considerable number are made empty there. The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rental charge is reasonable and should be allowed, but that it should not be put into effect until the 1917 crop is out of the way. It is an added expense which was not within the contemplation of producers and shippers in connection with the crop now coming to market. The postponement will also allow for the time necessary to apply the extra charge to interstate traffic from the Colorado and Wyoming territory which is competitive of Nebraska, is accordance with the promise of the carriers at the hearing.

As a part of its general plan of reconstruction applicant has rebuilt this exchange at a considerable expense. The Commission has not checked the record submitted by applicant in support of this application as to the value of the plant. The application was supported by a petition signed by almost all of the subscribers affected. On August 5, 1916. the Commission, after a careful investigation, au - thorized corresponding rates at the exchange at Elkhorn, zone service including Valley and all phones connected at the exchange at Valley. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that as a matter of operation and proper policing of the lines the zone service should be exchanged in the opposite direction and it will, subject to certain re - strictions, approve the rates at Valley. Heretofore applicant had a rate for Valley alone of $1.50 for business service and $1.00 for residence service and $1.25 for farm service, and for zone service covering the same territory a business rate of $1.75, residence rate of $1.50 and a farm line rate of $1.50. This was previous to the rebuilding of the exchange and making it a modern plant. The proposed rates, therefore, eliminate the optional rate for business and residence service at Valley and charge the residence service rate here - tofore in effect for the zone. The business rate for the zone is increased 75c per month. The farm line rate is unchanged. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com- APPLICATION NO. 3331 </seg>

It now owns and operates electric light and power plants located in the cities of Norfolk. Battle Creek, Meadow Grove and Tilden. Nebraska, with transmission lines connecting the same, and now proposes to extend the transmission lines from Tilden to Oakdale, a distance of approximately ten miles'. In this application the company request;,' permission to construct a three - phase electric transmission line of 33,000-volt capacity, the same to be operated for the present, and until further order of the Commission, at 16,000-volt pressure. The proposed line parallels at an intervening dis - tance of fifty-seven feet the telegraph and telephone line of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company and the Western Union Telegraph Company for a distance of about three miles' west of Tilden, and at an Intervening distance of 520 feet the same telephone and telegraph line for a distance of 600 feet east of Oakdale. On the remainder of the route the proposed line will parallel telephone lines belonging to the Nebraska Telephone Company, the Cedar Mutual Telephone Company and the Tilden Telephone Company on and within the limits of public highways. Agreements in writing, setting forth the details of the proposed con - struction, have been entered into between the applicant and each of the telephone companies affected, and signed copies of the same have been filed with the Commission. The Western T'nion Company entered into a similar agreement, subject to the approval of the Commission, and the railway company, but no approval or agreement was reached with the railway company. The railway company objects to the location of the transmission line on the three-mile parallel west of Tilden unless it is placed at least five hundred feet distant from the company's telegraph and telephone line, which is of grounded construction, giving as its' rea - son therefor that any closer location will result in serious inductive in - terference with the operation of a telegraph and telephone line. The evidence is conflicting as to the probabilities of inductive inter - ference by the transmission line with the telephone and telegraph line of the railway company. The representative for the railway company argued that substantial interference was bound to ensue, inasmuch as' the tele - graph and telephone line was of grounded construction, but gave no illustration from experience of such interference. Applicant's repre - sentative gave a number of instances of the location of high pressure transmission lines paralleling railway, telephone and telegraph lines wherein no material inductive interference had resulted.

            <seg id="p210">K1.KVr.X-' I PORT What are the elements or ultimate fai required to tablish a prima facie case in a proceeding involvii n Increase of public service rat* We said in re application of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone Com pany of Harlan County, No. 29S1, N.S.R.C. Report for 1918, page : What was and is a reasonable charge for public utility servic is such a rate as will produce sufficient revenue to operate and main tain the property in good serviceable condition, pay taxes, losses and damages, and yield a fair return on the capital contributed by stock holders which has been honestly and prudently expended for the pur - pose of furnishing the service. It is evident therefore that if the rates collected during the life of the company produced a revenue in excess of these requirements, the surplus belongs of right to the patrons of the utility and may be recovered for their benefit. If dis- tributed as dividends an assessment of stockholders will lie or the right of stockholders to earn future dividends suspended until the surplus is restored to the company's treasury. If invested in addi tions to the plant the stockholders may not earn a return upon it or capitalize it; and per contra, if the revenues in the past have not met the requirements as to operation, maintenance, taxes, losses, dam- ages, and return, and, assuming that the utility has been providently and efficiently conducted, the patrons are indebted to the utility and rates should be increased sufficiently to discharge the obligation within a reasonable time. The law as to public utility rates consti - tutes in effect a contract between the owners of the utility and its patrons with reciprocal obligations, and the duty of the Commission in administering the law is the same as that of the courts in enforc- ing mutually obligatory contracts in equity In addition to the authorities cited in the foregoing opinion, the case of People ex rel King* County L. Co. vs. Wilcox, 21n N. V. 479, is strongly in point. Quoting from the opinion: "Referring again to the Ames Case (supra I the public is entitled to be served at reasonable rates, and the corporation is entitled to a fair return on the property used by it in the public service, no more, no less, always assuming, of course, that the return is computed on a proper valuation. That was not made so !;y statute, but was the rule at common law. which justifies legislatures and commissions in fixing rates. If then a public service corporation has received more or less, as the case may be, than was its due, irrespective of whether a rate had been fixed by public authority If a deficiency in the fair return in the early years whs due to losses or expenditures which were reasonably necessary and proper in developing efficiency and economy of operation and in establishing a business, it should be made up by the returns in later years. If there was a fair return from the start the corporation has received all it was entitled to, irrespective of how much of the earnings may have been diverted to the building up of the business." Stockholders' capital, reasonably and judiciously invested in the property under consideration, is taken as the basis upon which to com - pute a return or profit, and the entire life of the property as' the period of computation. This involves a showing year by year of the capital in - vested and the revenues and expenses: also the amount of revenues revenue fc*t aside for deferred or unrealized depreciation of th property, and </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 213 law was rarely if ever enforced. Owners of old utilities may therefore well be excused for failing to keep accurate records of costs and revenues and expenses, especially in equity. Many instances of this lack have been encountered by this Commission, and it was found impossible to do substantial justice in such cases, either to the rate-payers or to the own- ers of the utility, without departing from the maximum of the rule as to the burden of proof. The investment cost basis was adhered to, but esti mates were accepted in lieu of books of account, and stockholders' capital arrived at by means of an estimated cost of building the property, based on prices of material and labor current at the time of. construction a of the contractual relation between stockholders and rate-payers. The i preceding years' income and outgo has occasionally been accepted as sufficient to indicate the rate of return, and in most cases the income and outgo for from one to five years preceding, only. It is plain, how - ever, that the law cannot be administered or substantial justice done between stockholders and rate-payers without having a considerable pro - portion of the history of the utility before the Commission and exact justice can be approached only in proportion to the completeness of this history. The burden of evidence resting upon the applicant in the instant case may, therefore, be said to consist of, (1) the amount of stock - holders' capital invested in the property under consideration, and the revenues and expenses of the property year by year during its history; the present value of the property, for comparison with the capital in- vested. If it is shown that the investment has been made judiciously, that the property lias been managed properly, that the return to stock- holders during the life of the property is not fairly compensatory, or. assuming that the return has been fair only, that the present value of the property is below the stockholders' investment, an increase of rates is justified. The above may he said to constitute the maximum burden of evi- dence resting upon applicants for rate increases. The history of rate cases shows, however, that such testimony is not always available, and through no fault of the applicant excepting ignorance of the law. The law limiting owners of public utilities to such rates only as would yield a fair return upon stockholders' capital is as old as the common law of which it is a part. But prior to the advent of regulation by the state the near as possible. le A further relaxation of the rule was found to be necessary in cases' where records of costs during the construction period were not available, and estimates of costs based upon prices prevailing at the time of the hearing were received as a sort of guide in arriving at the sacrifices of stockholders. But the aim generally has' be&lt;»n to get at the amount of stockholders' capital invested in the enterprise, as that is the "private property" that may not be taken or used by the public without just com- pensation. The same method has been followed as to the revenues and expenses of a utility but with less exactitude, owing to a lack of proper appreciation </seg>
            <seg id="p212">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT or on due showing that all or any part of this information is unavailable through no fault of the applicant in the exercise of reasonable care, dili - gence and foresight, estimates as a substitute for the missing information based as nearly as may be on the actual experience of the property will be received; (2) the judiciousness of investment and the proper adminis - tration of the property measured by the average practices of the industry under similar circumstances; (3) the present fair value of the property and the amount of revenues set aside for deferred depreciation yet un - expended; and (4) the return to stockholders during the life of the property measured by the earnings over and above the costs 1 of opera - tion, maintenance, deferred depreciation, taxes, insurance, losses and damages, applied to stockholders' capital, and that such return is not compensatory. The record shows, either directly or by the inference permitted in passing upon the motion to nonsuit app'Vu »t, that stock and bond hold - ers* capital in some amount bet wee.. ,-,,000 and f 33,000 was invested in the property under consideration between the years 1902 and 1912, and that the annual rate of return thereon, exclusive of the costs of opera - tion, maintenance, deferred depreciation, etc., was no more than reason - ably compensatory; that approximately $20,000 of additional capital was invested in the property subsequent to the year 1912, and that the rate of return upon the capital invested has not been reasonably compensatory for that period; that the original building of the plants by the predeces - sors of applicant, and the consolidation and betterments of those plants by the applicant, are in line with the average development of the tele - phone industry in this state, and that the management of the plants has been of the same character; that the present fair value of the property is less than the amount of owners" capital invested in it, and that the amount set aside from revenues to a depreciation reserve does not equal the difference between present value and investment; and that the return to the owners of the property during its life has not been fairly compensatory. These findings nor any of them shall not be held to conclude the Commission in the final determination of the cause. The motion to dismiss the application is, therefore, overruled and the proceeding is ordered for further hearing on a date to be fixed by the Commission subject to due notice to all parties of record.

OPINION AM) FINDING WILSON, Commissioner: The issues herein are set forth in the opinion adopted by the Com - mission May 13, 1918, N'.S.R.C report for 1918, page , in passing upon the motion to nonsuit applicant at the close of its testimony at the first hearing. Final hearing was held on July 9, 1918, at which the applicant completed its showing and the protestants introduced testimony. In ruling upon the motion to nonsuit applicant, the Commission neg - lected to state its reasons for not sustaining the objection that the Com - mission was without power to approve of an increase in the rates of sub - scribers residing in the city of Hebron on account of a franchise of the city limiting the rates to those now in force. As stated in the former opinion, the plant under consideration is the result of a consolidation of twg competing plants formerly owned by the Nebraska Telephone Com - pany and the Thayer County Telephone Company. The record shows two franchises of the city of Hebron, one to the Nebraska Telephone Com - pany, dated February 7, 1898, which contains no provision as to rates, and one to W. S. Francis and ('. M. McNeil, dated December 13, 1902, which contains the following provision: "The rates to be charged to patrons of said telephone exchange hall not exceed the sum of twenty-four ($24.00) dollars per year from business phones and fifteen ($15.) dollars per year from resi - dence phones." Applicant took an assignment in writing of the Nebraska Telephone company's franchise in February, 1912, at which time it purchased the Nebraska company's plent. Francis and McNeil built the other plant originally, inccrporatinc it later under the name of Hebron Telephone Company. In 1907, ap: ;rently, the Hebron company sold its plant to the Thayer County Telerlione Company, but no assignment of the Francis- McNeil franchise is shc.n in connection with the transaction. In 1912, applicant pun ased the orporate stocks of the Thayer County Telephone Company and took pos ss'ion of its plant. The two plants were then consolidated, with the ownership in applicant. Applicant claims thai it has not at any time operated the consolidated plant under tlu Francis McNeil franchise, and there being no evidence of record that it or its predecessor took an assignment of the franchise or in any manner agreed to the terms and conditions thereof, it is not bound by the rate provisions thereof. At least, no law is cited by the Protestants in support of that contention. However, Hebron is a city of the second class, the charter of which does not confer upon the city the power of fixing public utility rates either by agreement in the franchise </seg>
            <seg id="p214">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT or by subsequent regulation so as to oust the Commission of jurisdiction according to derision*,' of the supreme court of this state. Protestants objected also that the Commission lacks power to in - crease the rates of telephone companies situated wholly within a mu - nicipality of the jfate. Tin record shows that the plant under considera tion serves approximately 21n subscribers residing outside of the city of Hebron (about one-third of the total number of subscribers), and that the use of the facilities by all of the subscribers is so commingled that in addition for actual depreciation of the plant, for which future expendi tures will have to be made, and for the return due the owner. This involves a valuation of the property from the facts of record. No in ventory and physical valuation was made, the applicant offering none and the Commission deeming it unnecessary for the purposes of this cafe*. The record as to the cost of the property, the owner's investment, and the receipts and expenditures from the beginning is sufficiently complete to dispense with a physical valuation, in view of the fact that applicant is not asking for rates sufficient to yield a reasonable return upon the investment. The major portion of the investment was contributed by Francis and McNeil and by the Thayer County Telephone Company. The plant built by them included exchanges at Hebron, Belvidere and Carleton, mu - nicipalities in the same vicinity and connected by trunk lines. Francis and McNeil appear to have invested about $24,000 in money for which they issued to themselves $30,000 of 67c bonds, of the Hebron company when it was formed. The Thayer company added $14,250 to the investment from the sale of a like amount of 6 1 ", preferred stock at par and about $4,720 from borrowed money of which there was $5,236.62 on June 30 1912. This, gives $42,970 as the cost of the Thayer County Telephone Com pany plant. This cost may have been greater, however, as applicant paid $55,259 for it in 1912, based upon inventory and valuation, and there is nothing in the record as to the cost of additions' and betterments follow - ing the original establishment of the plant and up to June 30, 1907. The Hebron company was financially embarrassed at the time it transferred its assets to the Thayer County Telephone Company in 1907, due pre- sumably to the lack of capital to defray the cost of additions and better - ments demanded by the expansion incidental to the development of the plant. The total number of subscribers when applicant purchased the plant in 1912 was 840, of which 493 were within urban, limits and 347 in. t is impossible to fix rates for the rural subscribers entirely separate and ipart from the rates provided for city subscribers. The objection falls 'or another reason, namely, the exclusive jurisdiction granted to the Commission by constitutional and statutory provision over the rates of :elephone companies, regardless of their location as to municipalities. COST OF SERVICE The actual expenditures for operating and maintaining the plant in 1917, including repairs and taxes, was $7,478.70. Provision must be made </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 217 s'how the amount charged to the Belvidere and Carleton exchanges but if the same cost was applied to them, and the remainder charged to toll line equipment, the other charges were as follows: Belvidert $9,771.84 Carleton 643.56 (The purchase price was $58,275. of which $55,259 represented the plant, $2,."&gt;14 accounts receivable and .$."idO bonds.) There is nothing in the record as to the original cost of construction of the Nebraska Telephone Company's plant, but the price paid by appli - cant, $1,413, was so small a* to he negligible in arriving at the final re - sults herein. There is no doubt, however, but that full value was re - ceived by the purchase, as the property included an office and aerial equipment sufficient to serve a number of subscribers within the city of Hebron Prior to 1914, the plant was of been in exceedingly poor service &lt; rebuilt the system in 1914. and conv battery service in Hebron at a cos he grounded magneto type and had mdition for some time. Applicant &gt;rted it to the full metallic common 997.7:5. The old equipment taken out was credited to plant account at the invoice value placed upon it at the time of the purchase from the Nebraska and Thayer County companies, and the new equipment was charged 'o that account at cost. This resulted in a debit balance in plant account of $44,706.20, which applicant claims is the present reproduction new value of the property. The loss due to conversion was charged to the depreciation reserve fund created by applicant to cover the losses in its' entire system of exchanges. The balance in plant account compares with the cost shown of record of the Hebron exchange of the Thayer county plant, plus the purchase price of the Nebraska company plant and the cost of rebuilding and conversion, as follows: 9.208.08 Toll line equipnien the country. Costs of from fifty to sixty dollars per subscriber are fre- iiuently met with in plants constructed similarly to the one under con- sideration, which gives a range of $42,00(1 to $50,000 as a reasonable cost of the Thayer County plant. The exact cost is not material, however, as applicant is not claiming a reiurn on as large an amount as the cost shown of record. Upon purchasing the Thayer County plant applicant separated the price paid for it between the three exchanges represented according to their respective sizes, first charging to toll line construction the value of such lines included in the property. The amount charged to the Hebron exchange was $33,640.52, or $til &gt; .«4 per subscriber. The record does not Balance in plant account $44,706.20 Cost of Hebron exchange — 57. 727', of cost of Thayer County company's plant Purchase price of Nebraska company's' plant Cost of rebuilding and conversion $24,805.29 1,413.00 22.997.73 Total Reduction from cost $ 4,509.82 $49,216.02 </seg>
            <seg id="p216">218 Protestants offered in evidence tlie assessed valuation of applicant's property located within the limits of the city of Hebron for the years 1917 and 1918, in which the actual value of the property was fixed at $14,000, based upon applicant's report to the county assessor. They then sought to extend this valuation so as to include all of the plant by show - ing the number of subscribers located outside of the city limits compared with the number inside (which numbers were 220 and 40(1 respectively), and applying the unit value per subscriber found to exist within the city, to the entire plant. This would give a total plant value of $21,700 as - suming the unit value to be the same in the country as in the city. Pole line equipment costs much more per subscriber in the country than in town, but this might be equalized in the instant case by the greater cost of the full metallic and common battery facilities in town compared with the cost of the grounded facilities in the country, and the inclusion of all of the central office equipment in the town valuation. However, assessed values' correspond more closely in practice with market values than with cost figures, and market values are based upon the earning power of the property under consideration as well as upon cost. In fact, purchasers of going concerns devoted to public use look principally to a return upon the purchase price, as the property cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn from use. and it* junk value is only a small per - centage of the cost. The assessed values in the instant case are too high according to this measure. It is shown below that the property has no earning power whatsoever until the new rates go into effect. Protestants in no way challenge the correctness of the cost figures shown by the record nor the judiciousness of the investment, and since it is the sacri - fice of the owners upon which a return is to be computed in rate matters, the tax valuation is not entitled to consideration in the case at bar. The record shows without contradiction that the. plant is in good operating condition and that the service is if anything above normal in comparison to that given by similar plants. Witnesses for applicant tes - tified that the physical condition of the property was SO'; perfect, and no rebuttal was offered thereto. The Commission finds, therefore, without prejudice to subsequent valuations based upon more complete data, and for rate purposes only, that the reproduction new value of applicant's Hebron exchange property is $44,706.20, and that the present value is 2i)'; less than reproduction new value, or $35,765.00. These values represent the physical property only and there should be added to present value a reasonable allowance for working capital with which to buy materials and equipment needed for repairs and replacement in such quantities as will secure them at the lowest possible cost. Applicant requests an allowance of 67, of the reproduction new value for this purpose amounting to $2,670.25. The Commission considers this excessive in connection with the great num - ber of exchanges owned by the applicant and allows only Z%, or $1,335, making the present value of the property plus working capital $37,100. Applicant submitted an estimate of the cost of the service in 1918 based upon the cost in 1917, including l'\ of the reproduction new value </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 for future depreciation, and 7', upon present value and working capital for return to the owners. The Commission has held in numerous in stances that 6'; was sufficient for depreciation, and that the allowance for both maintenance and depreciation should not exceed 9'j ; and while the cost of everything entering into telephone plants has increased ma- terially during late years, sufficient cause is not shown in the instant case for increasing the allowance for this purpose. Applicants claim for a re turn of 7'; upon the investment is' also excessive in view of the fact that the average rate of interest and dividends paid upon its capital securities is approximately (!',, most of which securities are limited by contract to that rate. Owners of public utility securities are not entitled to a greater rate of return from the public than that contracted for by them with the corporate organization through which the service is furnished, and the burden is upon applicant for increased rates to show the cost to them of their capital funds. In the instant case, applicant neglected to make a complete showing in this respect. Its general manager testified to the following capital securities outstanding in 1913, approximately: Six per cent bonds, $1,000,0(10; 5 per cent preferred stock, $2,333,333; 6 and per cent preferred stock. $71,666,667; and common stock, $1,500,000 on which 7 per cent dividend*' were paid. The bonds have since been re- funded on a 5 per cent basis, of which there are $1,200,000 now outstand- ing. Assuming that the value of the property equals the par value of the capital securities, which should be the case under proper manage- ment, a return of 6 per cent on either of those values will pay the cost of the capital invested Revising applicants' estimate of cost for 1918 on this basis reduces it from $13,298.58 to $12,322.86, including allowances for depreciation re - serve and return to owners. REVENUES Applicant's revenues at the Hebron exchange during the past five years, including 25 per cent of the gross collections at the exchange for toll service, were as follows: 1913, $8,199.46; 1914, $7,850.32; 1915, $8,019.90; 1916, $8,723.57; 1917, $9,398.92. The expenses plus an allow - ance of 9 per cent of the reproduction new value for maintenance and depreciation, have exceeded the revenues every year, leaving nothing in the way of a return to the owners. Applicant also submitted an estimate of the annual revenue under the proposed schedule of rates as follows: 89 Individual business, at 40 Individual residence, at.... 244 Two-party residence, at.. 218 Farm, at 12 Extensions ibusiness), at in Miscellaneous, at . $2.50 1.50 1.25 .... 1.25 50 D.H. 222.50 60.00 305.00 272.50 6.00 613 Stations estimated monthly revenue * 866.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p218">220 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT There is no question of a surplus from previous revenues in this case. No return has ever been paid to the owners of the property from the beginning in excess of a reasonable return upon the capital contrib - uted by them.

TAYLOR, Commissioner: In the original opinion and order in this case, the Commission determined that $106,736 represented the fair value of the i-onsolidated property of the Monroe Independent Telephone Company and the Albion Telephone Company, and that stock to this amount could be issued by applicant. This figure represented what the Commission regarded as the actual investment of the stockholders in the properties. After the order was made, applicant filed a motion praying for a modification of the same, which motion was overruled. Whereupon, a rehearing was asked for on the ground that new evidence relating to the investment in the Albion Telephone Company had been discovered, and that this evidence would materially change Ihe figures as they were first pre- sented. A rehearing was granted at which testimony was submitted by several witnesses, that of T. K. Martin and N. G. Needham being the most important. Messrs.

It was upon the record they made and the books they kept that the Commission relied for informa - tion as to the actual investment made in the property. Counsel for applicant now contends that this record is so unreliable as to be value - less for the purpose used. The principal point involved is as to the salaries drawn by the partners during the early life of the company. The accountant of the Commission determined from the books that commencing with the year 1901 or 1902, Messrs. Martin and Needham drew from the company salaries of $1(10 per month each. The books disclosed that I his was not paid monthly or at any stated periods', but was drawn in varying sums. Tlic amounts were always 1 equalized, how - ever, and never exceeded $1,200 annually for each partner. Mr. Martin testified that fixed salaries were not drawn by either of the partners until 1908, and that for the eight years preceding that date, irregular sums aggregating $4,000 each were taken from the earnings. He was quite positive that this covered the lull amount of compensation. Mr. Needham, however, upon cross-examination, expressed the opinion that the salaries on the basis of $100 per month started in 1902. He was pressed on this point and after careful consideration of the matter and a second reference to the books, he became quite positive as to this fact. So we have the books themselves, which Mr. Needham kept, and his recollection of the matter, as against the recollection of Mr. Martin. The books are not confusing. Every dollar expended by the company was shown, and while the bookkeeping was not of the standard now required of public utilities, it was sufficiently complete to disclose how - much money was received and how much paid out. Counsel's conten - tion that some of the payments made to the partners' was for money advanced by them to construct the plant does not bear analysis for the reason that the amounts withdrawn in each instance equal $1,200 per year, and were the same to each partner, indicating a consistent policy with reference to the compensation that each was to receive. It hardly seems probable that repayments of money advanced would have been made in the same amount each year. Both gentlemen agreed that the salaries were at some time fixed at $1,200 per year. The only dis - agreement is as to when. Without the testimony of either, the Com - mission concluded that the time was the year 1902. Now that we have the testimony of one in support of that assumption, and only the un- supported recollection of the other to the contrary, we see no reason to change our conclusion. In the original order, Messrs. Needham and Martin were allowed salaries of $150 per month, each, from the begin - ning of the company to the time when they disposed of their interests'. From this was deducted the actual amount ot money drawn out in sal - aries, as shown by the books, at the rate of $100 per month from 1902. We remain of the opinion that this constitutes an equitable allowance for this purpos \ The remainder of the testimony offered by Messrs. Martin and Needham in nowise modifies the facts as shown by the books. There was some evidence to the- effect that they furnished teams and buggies </seg>

According to their recollection, however, the whole amount could not have exceeded $200. As to the motorcycles and automobile purchased and used later, it was admitted that they were purchased from the earn - ings of the company and maintained from the same source. The ex - change at Cedar Rapids, which was sold for $2,500, which money was turned into the treasury of the company, was originally a part of the Albion Telephone Company, and the money thus realized was reinvested in the property and did not represent any additional investment.

Counsel for applicant, who is engaged in the telephone busi - ness, makes what he terms a "business and common sense" valuation of the property by taking the main items of property and estimating their worth, thus arriving at a figure of $B2.960. In view of the fact that Mr. Couch spent several days in an examination of the plant, made his own inventory, and searched the records for original costs, we are inclined to place more faith in his figures than in an office valuation prepared by an attorney who makes no claim of having inspected the plant. An example of the difference between Mr. Couch's valuation and that of the "business and common sense" estimate is shown in the ease of furniture. In the Couch valuation, two office desks, one typewriter and cabinet, three office chairs, one swivel chair, one park seat, some cuspidors, one wastebasket, gas and electric fixtures, and office bookrf and files are given a value of $294.50.

OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR/ i orumissioner: (&gt;n July 1, 1917, the Commission approved an application of the Cen - tral City Gas Company for authority to issue $10,000 of its common stock. Applicant now asks for an amended order providing for an increase of $5,000, alleging that the actual investment now represents $12,087.08, and that the remainder of the total of $15,000 will be required to finance fur- is' $11,110.15. This includes the original purchase price of $2,500, the new construction to date and $300 for expense of general offices. In addition there is an item of $390.02, covering interest from February 1, 1916, the date of the purchase of the plant, to July 1. 1917, the date on which the outstanding stock was approved. This amount does not cor - respond with the amount claimed by applicant, as shown above, due, prob - ably, to a much longer period being taken by the company than was re - garded as proper by the Commission's accountant. At the time the present outstanding stock was issued it was accepted by the stockholders in lieu of certain notes which were drawing interest. These notes, there - fore, ceased from that time to be obligations of the company and became the personal obligations of the stockholders, the interest on which should thereafter be paid by the individuals. As to the amount shown by the accountant, we are of the opinion it is a proper capital allowance. While the company, since it took over the plant, has increased the number of consumers and the revenue, it is still operating at a deficit. The interest accruals, under the circumstances, may be considered a proper develop - ment expense, if confined to the period referred to. The Commission is of the opinion that the deficits should not be capitalized. They constitute a part of the hazards the investors assumed At PLICATION NO. 2730 ther improvements.

This figure differed from the ordinary present value as determined by the reproduc - tion method, in that it was based on an estimate of what it would reason - ably require to bring the plant up to an efficient standard.

            <seg id="p226">228 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commisioner: The Panama exchange of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph com - pany, hereafter referred to as the Lincoln company, was originally a. grounded system and so continued until the fall of 1916, when it was re - built and the plant changed to a metallic system. Immediately following the reconstruction of the plant the Lincoln company made application for permission to readjust its rate schedule by increasing the rates, re - ducing the number of subscribers on the farm lines to a minimum of ten, and extending the service so as to include the exchange of Hickman. The present rates on the exchange are $1.00 per month for all classes of service. The new schedule as applied for is as follows at; to the principal classes of service Individual business Two-party business One-party residence Two-party residence Ten-party farm $2.50 per month 2.00 per month 1.50 per month 1.25 per month 1.50 per month For the past year the reconstructed plant with the improved service has been in operation. The company serves 176 subscribers', over 90''; of whom, upon solicitation by representatives of the applicant, approved of the reconstruction of the plant and consented to the increased rates. Subscribers at the present time have service with the exchanges at Ben - net and Firth, and it is one of the conditions of the application that a free exchange of service Shall also be had with the neighboring town of Hickman, thus providing intercommunication between the people in a natural service zone. It was necessary for the company to construct a trunk line from Panama to Hickman in order to provide for the new service. Applicant submitted at the hearing a statement of revenues and ex - penses for the year ending June 30, 1916. Following instructions from the Commission, a statement was subsequently submitted presenting a history of the plant from the beginning of its operation down to the present. Considerable other data has upon the request of the Commis - sion been supplied. The Panama exchange was built originally by the Farmers United Telephone Company, which also built the exchange at Bennet, both being operated as one system until their purchase by applicant in 1912. The average number of telephones in service for the four and one-half year period of operation by the Farmers company was 182 at Bennet and 166 at Panama. The property investment ranged from $20,142.00 at the be - ginning to $22,225 at the time of sale. The outstanding capital stock of the company was $17,450, with bonds and bills payable of $2,472.00. For the fifty-six months of operation of the Farmers company the total revenue from all sources was $25,641. The total operating expens'e, exclusive of depreciation and dividends, was $14,801, leaving a net in - come, available for dividends and depreciation reserve, of $10,840. Allow- </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE KAIYAVAY COMMISSION 229 ing dividends of seven per cent on the outstanding capital for the full period, we have $5,699.68. Deducting this from the net income there remains $5,139.71, which is a net surplus available for depreciation. The Panama plant's apportionment of this, on the basis of the subscribers, stations in service, is $1,901.69. The reserve for depreciation accumulated by applicant from the time it took over the Panama plant on January 1, 1913, to January 1, 1918, amounts to $1,296.67. This is arrived at after deducting from the gross revenues the actual oper.iting expense as shown by applicant and an allowance for dividends of seven per cent upon $6,456.50, which is the portion of the original capital allotted to the Panama exchange, on the basis' of the subscribers' stations. On this basis, therefore, there has been accumulated out of the revenues of the Panama exchange from the time it started up to January 1, 1918, a surplus of $3,193. 36, which depreciation and accounted for in struction of the Panama plant. hould be regarded as a reserve for jnsidering the cost of the recon- At the time of the hearing the w. not completed and it was necessary the improvements.

It is the opinion of this Commission that any portion of a depreciation reserve invested in additions and betterments should earn a return in the same manner and to the same extent as the capital investment in the same property, and that such return should be credited to the depreciation reserve and not paid out in the form of dividends. Whenever the depreciation fund is reimbursed by proceeds from th can then be paid to the holders of sale of capital securities the earnings uch securities. Earnings and expenditures for able and are used instead of figu eleven months of 1917 are now avail - os for former periods as being more reflective of actual conditions. They cover operation since the plant was made metallic, and should include any increased cost due to the im - proved service. At the time of the hearing this increased cost was esti - mated by the company at 15^; . Taking these figures for eleven months and readjusting them to the basis of a year and applying the rrirciples above outlined, we have the following statement: </seg>
            <seg id="p228">IM ELEVENTH ANNTAL RKPORT It is manifest that the present rates are insufficient to pay the op erating expenses and provide for maintenance and depreciation, to say nothing of a return upon the investment.

For example, the rental revenue is' based on the assumption that the sub - scribers to the present Monroe exchange will all take the highest class of service, whereas, they may decide to s'elect two or four-party service at less rates. The reduction of toll revenue by reason of the opening to Albion subscribers of free connection to 5,000 subscribers in that territory will be very substantial. It is estimated here at $500 per year. It may exceed that sum, as studies submitted to the Commission in previous cases show that 65% to 75% of all toll business is" produced within a radius of fifty miles of an exchange. Certain it is that all the toll revenue now collected by the Albion company from traffic between Albion and the exchanges included in this free service zone will be lost. In addition to losing this revenue, the consolidated exchange will encounter an in - creased expense due to the increase in traffic that is' sure to follow the extension of the free service. Addition of 930 subscribers to the free service group will add materially to the traffic load, thus calling for more operators and additional switching facilities. Just how these readjust - ments will affect the revenues and expenses, it is impossible to forecast. Consequently, the surplus shown above may he materially reduced. It provides a margin of safety which appears to be none too large under the circumstances. Any surplus over and above the operating expenses and dividends en the investment will be treated as a trust fund and held subject to the further order of the Commission.

            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 235 shown, the Commission is of the opinion that the rates as applied for should be approved. The application of a discount for prompt payment has operated so sat - isfactorily in the Albion company that the Commission is of the opinion the rule should be continued by the Monroe company. The horizontal discount of 10 per cent, however, is rather awkward of application. A better plan, we believe, would be to quote gross rates with a fixed dis - count for prompt payment. A discount of 25 cents per month on business telephones and 15 cents per month on all other telephones should atcure satisfactory results and be somewhat more equitable. Applicant desires authority to apply to the Albion exchange its rule requiring subscribers to pay for the batteries used in the telephone in - .struments, this 1 being the practice in the Monroe system. Such a rule is quite common among companies such as the Monroe, which originated as a strictly mutual organization with rates intended to cover only the actual cost of service. In such companies, the subscriber usually purchased and owned his instrument, which he was required to maintain. In this' case, however, the rates approved are sufficiently high to cover the maintenance of the entire plant. To require the subscriber to furnish batteries would be to duplicate revenue for that expense. Moreover, the best service demands that the company itself retain control of the maintenance of its property. The condition of a telephone instrument concerns not only the subscriber in whose home or place of business it is located, but every other subscriber who may have occasion to talk through it. For that reason, the company should not leave to the subscriber the discretion of determining when the batteries, which constitute a vital part of the in - strument, should be renewed. By supplemental applications, authority is asked to charge 25 cents per month additional for des'k sets for business and residence service, and to make a rate of $2.00 per month for business telephones on farm lines. The additional rate for desk sets the Commission has approved quite gen - erally and believes to be a reasonable rule. The same is true of the rate for business service on farm line.-!. Both of these rates will be ap - proved.

Lambe and J. F. Fults For Remonstrators — J. G. Thompson. OPINION AND FINDINC TAYLOR, Commissioner: This is an application for authority to increase exchange rates in a net amount of 25 cents per month on all classes of service. Permission is prayed for to fix the gross increase at 40 cents per month, but from this it is' proposed to make a discount of 15 cents per month for prompt payment. The rates at the present time are as follows: Individual business $1.50 per month 2.00 per month 1.00 per month 1.00 per month Individual business (desk) Individual residence Farm residence Applicant's plant is metallic in town, with grounded farm lines. On December 31, 1917, it was serving 63 business subscribers, 188 residence subscribers, and 317 farm subscribers, or a total of 568. About three </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 237 years ago, the wires within the town were put under ground, being en - closed in lead cables laid in trenches. This method of distribution has proven very Satisfactory so far. With the exception of the switchboard, the system in town is, therefore, in good, serviceable condition. The country lines are not in as good condition and require considerable re - construction. The construction of the plant was commenced in 1904. and the portion not replaced in the meantime is nearing the end of its normal usefulness. The company contemplates considerable reconstruction in the near future. As a matter of fact, some of it has been already com - menced. The plant is owned and operated by a partnership composed of A. Gaddis and W. F. Ellis. Mr. Gaddis started the plant in 1904 and sold a half interest to Mr. Ellis in 1908 for $12,500. Later, a third partner was taken in, but he remained only a few months, reselling his interest to Gaddis and Ellis. It is difficult to ascertain from the records the exact amount of the investment in the plant as made by the owners. The purchase by Ellis for cash and notes of a half interest on the basis of $25,000 is the only direct evidence as to the actual sacrifice of either of the partners, and it is impossible to determine what portion of the plant had been built out of surplus earnings up to the time of this purchase. Since 1910, according to the report of the Commission's accountant, addi - tions and betterments in the amount of $6,146 have been built out of earnings The partners have fixed their salaries at $100 per month. While they have declared no dividends as such during the life of the business, they have drawn a total of $29,154.80. which exceeds the salaries by $7,554.80. This excess may very properly be regarded as dividends. It $25,000 were to be accepted as the stockholders' investment, and 7 per cent be allowed for dividends, the owners would have been entitled to a total of $15,750. Deducting the $7,554.80 drawn in excess of salaries leaves $8,195.20 as dividends earned but unpaid. If, in lieu of dividends, we credit to the capital account the additions and betterments constructed out of earnings in the amount of $6,146, we have remaining $1,948.23. During the period, interest in the total sum of $2,300 has been paid. Some of this has been paid on money borrowed individually by the partners, and, consequently, was not a proper charge against the revenues. It Is prob - able, therefore, that the balance of the deferred dividends is offset by the interest thus paid for the benefit of the owners. A physical valuation of the property made by the Commission's engineers in December, 1916, shows a reproduction value, including toll property, of $35,386.26, and a present value of $23,516.64. Excluding the property devoted to toll us'e, the reproduction value is $32,463.50 and the present value, $21,727.84. For the purposes of this case, the toll revenues and expenses will be included, so that the entire property may be considered. </seg>
            <seg id="p236">238 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT The statement of the revenues and expenses for the calendar year of 1917 is fairly reflective of the conditions as they now exist. Instead, however, of taking the figures reported for maintenance, we will, follow - ing our usual practice, make an allowance of 9 per cent on the reproduc - tion value of the property for both maintenance and depreciation. The statement, correspondingly readjusted, is as follows: The figure of $171.14, uncollectible accounts, is based on 2 per cent of the gross revenue, an allowance we have approved in other case3. From August 1, 1917, to January 1, 1918, the loss to the company from this source aggregated $1,042.09, which is approximately 2 per cent of the revenue. According to the accountant's report, there was outstand - ing at the time the report was compiled $2,000 in delinquent toll and rental revenues. In the foregoing statement, it should be noted there is lacking any item for insurance, either fire or casualty. No expenditure for this pur - pose appears in the record since 1909. Evidently, the owners' prefer to assume the risk themselves. Ordinarily, telephone companies carry Rentals 17,254.00 Toll 1,279.48 Sundry sales 2.60 Miscellaneous 3.80 Interest 17.80 Total $8,557.68 $8,557.68 EXPENSES Operators $1,256.15 Stationery and advertising 96.55 Light, heat, water and power 113.70 Messenger service 1.15 Incidental 46.20 $1,513.75 Salaries of officers.'. $2,400.00 Salaries of clerks 270.00 Legal expenses .... 221.00 $2,891.00 Maintenance and depreciation (9% on $35,366) $3,184.74 $3,184.74 Total $7,589.49 Net income Deductions: ...$ 968.19 Taxes $ 326.41 Uncollectible accounts 171.14 497.55 Available for dividends $ 470.64 </seg>
            <seg id="p237">239 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION insurance and the expense for the same is regarded by this Commission as a legitimate charge against revenues. For that reason, some allow - ance should be made in this case, although we make no attempt to fix the amount. Vigorous complaints as to the service furnished by the company, particularly on the farm lines, were voiced at the hearing. While these complaints are explained in part by the owners, it is admitted by them that the present switchboard is old and not in the best of condition, and that a new one should be installed. This is also the opinion of the engi - neer of the Commission, who made the valuation. The Commission is of the opinion that the switchboard constitutes the chief source of the difficulties and that it should be replaced. It is' probable, also, that the reccnstruction of the farm lines will contribute to the improvement of the service. There is a de. land for continuous 24-hour service through - out the week. At the present time, only limited service is given on Sunday. At night, while tlurc is an operator on duty, the rules provide for an extra charge for call; between the hours of 10 p. m. and 6 a. m. unless for a doctor or emergencies. In a county seat, such as Beaver City, and with as many subscribers as are served by this exchange, there should be continuous service. The rates in the past, as we held in Formal Complaint 300, harc'ly justified the additional service. With the increase proposed, however, the company should be able to provide it. The net increase will amount to approximately $1,700. From the showing as set forth in the operating statement, it is apparent that this will not be more than is sufficient to cover operating expenses as they were in 1917, together with the increases that will be required by the improved service, and dividends on the investment in the property. It follows, therefore, that the rate as applied for should be approved, subject to conditions. The plan to charge a gross rate, from which a reduction of 15 cents per month shall be made for prompt payment, is a reasonable regulation and has' been uniformly approved by this Commission. It should result in reducing the delinquent accounts which are rather large for a company of this size. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Beaver City Telephone Ex - change be, and the same hereby is, authorized to charge and collect the following schedule of rates, subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth : Individual business (wall) Individual business (desk) Individual residence $1.90 per month 2.40 per month 1.40 per month 1.40 per month Farm residence A discount of 15 cents per month will be allowed if payment is made on or before the tenth of the month in which rental is due.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 2951 In the Matter of the Application of the Ohiowa Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Its Rates 'or All Classes of Service. OPINION AND FINDING Appearances: For Applicant— I. C. Steele, president TAYLOR, Commissioner Applicant desires authority to file a new and increased schedule of rates. The present and proposed schedules are as follows, the rates quoted being for the month: Present Proposed Business $1.50 $2.00 Individual residence 1.25 1.50 Party residence 1.00 1.25 Farm 1.00 1.25 The company is now owned by I. C. Steele and wife, who purchased it in December, 1914. for a cash consideration of $15,000. It was organ ized in 1903. The records in the Commission show that the original in - vestment was $10,000, represented by $5,000 of common and $5,000 of preferred stock. Sworn statements made by the original incorporators show that this .-.;ock was sold for cash at par The records of the com - pany are available only from 1908, when annual reports began to be filed with the Commission. In 1908, dividends of seven per cent were paid on both common and preferred stock. From 1909 to 1914, dividends of </seg>
            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 243 ten per cent on common and seven per cent on preferred stock were paid. No dividends in any amount have been received by the present owners since they acquired the property. A physical valuation made by the engineers of the Commission itiows a reproduction new value of the property of $24,637.42, and a present value of $16,484.23. From these figures, should be deducted $550, repre - senting the value of certain real estate owned by the company, but not required for the purposes of the telephone business. This leaves a value of $24,087.42 reproduction new, and $15,934.23 present value. All of the lines in town are metallic, but the farm lines', with the exception of eight, are grounded. The plant is quite compact, the longest farm leads,' not exceeding seven miles in length. Except on one or two farm lines, there are not more than ten subscribers to the line. At the time the property was purchased by the present owners, there were about 370 subscribers. These have now increased to 408. Aside from the addi - tional construction required to furnish service to these new subscribers, there have been but slight additions and betterments. The plant, as in - dicated by the studies made by the engineers, is, not in good condition and will require very general reconstruction within the next two or three years. The owners have alreadv purchased two carloads of poles which will be placed this summer and other repairs are contemplated. The unpaid dividends on the $10,000 of original investment for the period since the present owners acquired the property (about three and a half years) amount to $2,450 on the basis; of seven per cent. If we add this to the original investment, we have $12,450, which would appear to represent the actual investment in the property to date. Following the Commission's usual method of allowing nine per cent on the reproduction new value of the property for maintenance and de - preciation, and using the statement submitted by applicant as to revenues and other operating expenses, we have the following: EARNINGS Rentals on basis of number of sta- tions in service $5,031.00 Toll 297.72 $5,328.72 OPERATION One operator, at $35 $ 420.00 One operator, at $25 300.00 One operator, at $13 156.00 One operator, at $5 60.00 Sta. and advertising 42.31 Light, heat, water and power 110.00 Incidental 18.00 $1,106.31 GENERAL Manager, at $75 $ 900.00 Traveling expenses 25.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p242">244 ELEVENTH ANNl'AL REPORT From this, it is to be seen that applicant is now operating at a slight deficit. This deficit is? certain to be increased, if it has not already taken place, by increased salaries of operators. There are four of these and Manager Steele testified that he had already promised advances of at least $5.00 per month to each. Since this application was filed, he has asked for authority to decrease the night Service now furnished. The night operator now receives $13 per month. It would appear the better policy to increase the pay for l his position so that tha operator could afford to devote full time to it. and thus continue a full 24-hour service. The increases proposed will aggregate approximately $300 per year. Mr. Steele, as manager, has been receiving $75 per month and has been devoting his full time to the company. He feels that lie is entitled to an increase and the Commission is of the opinion that his compensation is less than his services are worth. All the expenses' of operating the plant have been increased and will probably continue to increase. In view of these considerations, therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that some increase in revenue is necesVsary. The increased rates as asked lor would produce additional revenue to the amount of $1,275 per year. This appears to be more than is re - quired.

Replacement of parts of the plant which are outworn is now gradually go - ing on, the cost of which when complete will doubtless exceed the amount of this surplus.

FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: This is an application of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone Com - pany of Harlan county, Nebraska, hereinafter called the company, for an increase of its telephone rates.

The company asks authority to increase the rates charged residence subscribers to $1.EO per month, with a provision that if paid before the tenth day of each month a discount of twenty-five cenih' shall be allowed and if paid one year in advance a further discount of 8 r 'c applicable to all of its rates shall be a'lowed. The company also asks authority to in - crease its switching rate to forty-five cents per month, with a provision that such charges shall be paid six months in advance by the rural com - panies, and to discontinue system service and to furnish service at month - ly rates only at the exchange with which the subscriber is directly con - nected, regular toll rates to prevail on service between exchanges. Tho company also requests that an order be made prohibiting any subscriber on party lines listening in on conversation passing over said lines' and imposing a penalty of twenty-five cents for each offense, to be collected by the company. Three separate answers were made to the application, signed by fifty-five of the subscribers. These answers admit all of the company's allegations except as to the value of the plant, the burdensome character of the system service provided and the inadequacy of the rates. The answers allege further that the company represents an investment of les.*, than $30,000; that the principal part of the present value of said plant was paid for originally out of the company's revenues, and that in addi - tion thereto most of the rural lines were built or paid for by the sub - scribers connected with the lines?; that the company's profits "have been used in the purchase of unnecessary real estate and the building of un - necessary buildings at the various towns where the exchanges of said company are located;" that the applicant's plant is practically a county system and that the value of the service to the sMbseriberr is based large - ly upon their ability to talk over one exchange to another without extra cost; that the service rendered by the company is insufficient and not worth the rates now charged therefor and that the increased rates ap - plied for are excessive and unreasonable. Pursuant to notice duly given, a hearing was held in the court house at Alma, Nebraska, on January 12 and 13, 1917, at which considerable testimony was received from the company and protestants: subsequently the Commission directed its accounting and engineering departments to make proper accounting and engineering studies of the company's prop - erty and plant, and a second hearing was held a&gt; the offices of the Com - mission in the following December for the purpose of receiving the reports of such studies in evidence. </seg>

Peter* vs. R. R. Co., 42 Ohio St. 275. "It is also beyond controversy that when a carrier accepted goods without payment of the cost of carriage or an agreement as, 1 to the price to be paid, and made an unreasonable exaction as a condition of the delivery of the goods, an action could be maintained to recover the excess over a reasonable charge.

Vol. 10, page 449 The common law is in effect in Nebraska except as modified by leg - islative enactment, and the legislature has not seen fit to change the law as above set forth. In fact, the two instances wherein the legislature has limited the rates of c«mmon carriers, — those of joint railway and irriga - tion rates', it has merely repeated the common law obligation. It can hardly be said that when the legislature declared it to be unlawful for any common carier to charge rates in effect on January 1, 1907, without the consent of this Commission, as set forth in the Commission Act (Art. 10, Rev. Stat. of Nebr. 1913), that it intended to legalize the rates in effect on the date named. The language conveys a ttatu quo ante meaning pure and simple and was designed to arrest the rate increase movement then in progress, and to compel the carriers to justify increases. It was not even a maximum rate law such as the two-cent passenger and freight rate laws, under which the railroads were permitted to charge lower rates than those prescribed. It appears altogether unreasonable that the legis - lature intended to abrogate the old time obligation of the common law by an enactment which in no wise is indicative of such a purpose. The insuperable difficulties experienced by the patrons of public utili - ties' in securing service at reasonable rates led directly to the establish - ment of regulatory commissions. The state undertook to do what the individual was practically powerless to do. It stepped into the patrons' shoes as it were. No additions' were made to the substantive law as to public service rates, or as to the other principal obligation of common carriers — service. The state merely created an institution for the en - forcement of law. As the Nebraska supreme court said in C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. vs. Nebraska State Railway Commission, S8 Nebr., 242, in con - struing the Commission Act. "it is remedial in character." In other </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 251 words, il merely provides a remedy for existing wrong. It did not define the wrong because the wrong was already denned. Therefore, whatever a patron of a public- utility could have done previous to the creation of the Commission, the Commission can do — that is, the Commission can recover for the benefit of the patron in one form or another the excess above reasonable rates charged by the utility, with the additional ad - vantage that the law of limitation does not operate against action by the slate. The Commission is specially charged by the act empowering it not only to enforce all of the laws of the state relating to the control and regulation of common carriers but also to investigate all probable viola - tions thereof. It is therefore the duty of the Commission to recover reve - nues from common carriers which have accrued from excessive and extor - tionate rat e^ whenever such a condition comes to its notice. What was and is a reasonable charge for public utility service is such a rate as will produce sufficient revenue to operate and maintain the property in good, serviceable condition, pay taxes, losses and damages, and yield a fair return on the capital contributed by stockholders which has been honestly and prudently expended for the purpose of furnishing the service. It is evident therefore that if the rates collected during the life of the company produced a revenue in excess of these requirements, the surplus belongs of right to the patrons of the utility and may be re - covered for their benefit. If distributed as dividends an assessment of stockholders will lie or the right of stockholders to earn future dividends suspended until the surplus is restored to the company's treasury. If in - vested in additions' to the plant the stockholders may not earn a return upon it or capitalize it ; and per contra, if the revenues in the past have not met the requirements as to operation, maintenance, taxes, losses, damages, and return, and, assuming that the utility has been providently and efficiently conducted, the patrons are indebted to the utility and rates should be increased sufficiently to discharge the obligation within a reasonable time. The law as to public utility rates constitutes in effect a contract between the owners of the utility and its patrons with recipr - ocal obligations, and the duty of the Commission in administering the law is the same as that of the courts in enforcing mutually obligatory con - tracts in equity. The highly equitable character of the law is apparent especially when compared with the rule adopted in rate cases where, for want of a financial history of the company, the value of the property devoted to public use at the time of the hearing was taken as' the basis for a return to stockholders. As much as one-half of the property may have been built out of surplus revenues, or the property may have come but re- cently upon a reasonable return basis with a record of no return what - soever in its early years — situations commonly met with. Present value takes no account of such circumstances, nor of the inducement to the investment — a reasonable return on it. And present value from its very nature is bound to result in injustice either to the owner of the utility or to the patrons in nearly every case. Values fluctuate from year r.o year and sustain no dependable or uniform relation to cost (instance, the </seg>

This would also be true as 1 to the maintenance of the property. Basement and roof are common to the whole building and a single plant heats it. The only practical method whereby the company can avail itself of any part of the building is by lease. The Commission finds that the purchase by the company of lots 1 and 2 in block 12, original town of Alma. Nebraska, was without warrant in law as far as the patrons of the company are concerned, and that the investment of $12,715.46 of the company's funds in said lots and buildings erected thereon was illegal. The record shows that all of the company's stockholders approved of the transactions and they are therefore liable for this unlawful diversion of funds. Assessment of the stockholders in an amount necessary to restore the funds to the treasury would doubtless lie, but in view of the present unmarketable character of the company's securities and the comparatively large number of stockholders', action of this character would doubtless result in many of the stockholders parting with their holdings at considerable loss and thus entail a needless sacri - fice. In view of the scant dividends paid by the company during its early years, the considerable donations of labor in the construction of the plant, and a surplus of property above the capital paid in plus depreciation re - quirements, the company's stock is worth considerable more than par. The company would doubtless be entitled upon application and complete showing, to issue a substantial stock dividend to its members. However, the prescribed investment may not stand and the company will be pro - hibited from declaring and paying or issuing dividends upon its stock until such time as the building is sold for a sum equal to $12,715.46, plus a net income or interest thereon at l r ', per annum from January 1, 1917, the date the building was substantially completed, or until that amount has accumulated in unpaid or unis&amp;'ued dividends at 1 C ,\ per annum upon the company's stock or in the uncompensated sacrifice of stockholders, at which time the property may be conveyed to the stockholders in lieu of such dividends. The Commission's engineers found the reproduction new value and also the present value of this Alma property to be $13,000. The reproduc - tion new value of the remainder of the company's' property was placed at $68,278.38. This latter amount will therefore be taken as the basis for the allowance of maintaining the property and the percentage to meet the cost of maintenance and depreciation is fixed at 9 r ; per annum. The experience of rnnny cases as to such costs in normal times shows a per - centage of from T~ r to 8^ of their reproduction new values. The record shows extraordinary advances in costs of materials since the beginning of the war, which is recognized in the greater allowance. The company will therefore be required to set aside from its revenues and credit to a fund to be known as the maintenance and depreciation fund the sum of $510.00 per month, which may be used for no other purpose than in main - taining the property without the express consent of the Commission. </seg>

(10 per telephone, which would be $49,800 for that part of the plant. The present value of the company's property, ex - clusive of the Alma building, as returned by the Commission engineers, is $45,692.71. The vacant lots in Alma, lots 3 und 4 in block 12 of original town, were inadvertently omitted from the inventory. Their cost to the company is $1,573. Measured by the cost of the corner lot on whicli the building was located — $1,000. the cost is seen to be too great to be taken as present value and their present value is fixed at $1,000. The engineers made a thorough inspection and investigation of the property and arrived at its present value by comparing its physical condition with a theoretical - ly new plant of the same characier. The unusual disparity between the reproduction new value and the present value, showing a depreciation of over 33 r ; , is accounted for by the badly worn and decayed condition of much of the company's equipment. The company impliedly admits this condition by reciting an extensive list of needed betterments', and it is further reflected in the poor quality of the company's service. The com - pany did not support its claim of value with any sort of inventory and it did not attack the findings of the engineers. The engineers' report of present value supplemented by the fair value of the Alma real estate omitted therefrom will therefore be accepted by the Commission and the present value of the company's property exclusive of the Alma building and grounds is fixed at $46,700. The subject of the expenditures of the company's revenues is not entirely clear owing to the incompleteness of the company's books of account. The company began business in 1901 and proceeded with the construction of its plant at the rate of from four to five thousand dollars a year during the first ten years. Little beyond a simple cash account was kept during the early years, and the accounts kept since annual re - ports were required to be made to the Commission do not show with de - sirable exactness the expenditures for plant construction, maintenance and operation, separately. The company offered no testimony in account form as to expenditures. It contented itself with a statement of its gen - eral account balances as of December 31, 1916, and with the declaration that all of its revenues have been expended in constructing, operating and maintaining the plant, with the exception of dividends at the rate of 6'1 per annum on the capital stock since June 30, 1908. This statement appears to be correct with the addition of .i 7'J dividend for the year ending June 30, 1908, and a dividend April 1. 1906, of 10'",, half of which was paid in ca.-ti and half in company stock. The paid-up capital on January 1, 1915, the earliest account date of record, was $7,730, and on April 1, 1909. $15,692.50. The balance now in the account is $16,012.50.

The bal - ances of the company's general accounts' on December 31, 191ti, reduced to finalities, are as follows: The foregoing statement is fairly illustrative of the accounts during the entire history of the company. Not enough cash on hand to pay taxes then delinquent, and repair and maintenance requirements to the amount of thousands of dollars going begging. There is an abundance of surplus to cover depreciation, but all of it is' invested in the plain and the Alma real estate. The basis of the company's application for increased rates' is the need of cash funds with which to make immediate repairs and replacements, the minimum cost of which was estimated at $5,160. This does no I in - clude the replacement of open wire construction with cable, considered necessary by the company at Alma, Orleans and Republican City, and the addition of thirty-six wires to country lines in order to limit party subscribers to ten to a wire, which would cost at least $5,00(1. It is manifest that if the company had confined the extent of its real property at Alma to the needs of the service, it would have a substantial part of the funds required for these purposes' in its treasury; and particularly so if the management had recognized in any degree that the first purpose of revenues is to operate and maintain the existing plant in good service - able condition. There is absolutely no obligation in law or equity upon the patrons of a public utility to pay rates to be used In constructing the plant. This obligation is upon the stockholders,'. It is a capital not a rate charge, and the owner of a public utility will not be heard by the Commission to say that an advance in rates is necessary for construction purposes or for maintenance and depreciation where the revenues have gone into plant construction and about $1,000 in profits from sales of company property. The remainder of the cost of the plant, about $37,000 — nearly 60',, came from operating revenues. No part of the revenues or receipts from any source was set aside for deferred depreciation, and the expenditures for repairs and replace- ments were not enough to maintain the plant in efficient operating con- dition.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 15th day of April, 1918 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, T. L. HALL, Chairman. Attest: T. A. Browne, Secretary (SEAL) In the Matter of the Application of the Daw - son-Nemaha Telephone Company, of Daw - ton, Nebraska, for Authority to Increase Rates on Business and Residence Tele - phones to $1.75 and $1.25, Respectively. OPINION AND ORDER HALL, Commissioner This matter came on to be heard by the Commission on the 17th day of September, 1917. The applicant is operating a telephone exchange at Dawstm, Nebraska, with 20 business telephones. 55 town residence tele - phones and 205 country telephones, for which they receive $1.00 per sta - tion for all classes of service. The application is to increase the resi - dence rates to $1.25 per month and the business rates to $1.75. This would give the company a total annual increase of $960. According to the testimony of the company, there is $7,375 in stock out - standing at the present time, upon which they have paid dividends varying from 2*7 to 12 r ' f per year. However, for certain years no dividends were paid at all, the average dividend for the past five years being approxi - mately 9H-. From time to time the company borrowed money to pay the above dividends referred to and afterwards paid off the indebtedness out of the rates. The company also borrowed $3,100 for reconstruction, ex - tensions and betterments and maintenance of the plant. This 1 indebted - ness had been reduced to $1,000 from the operating income. From a careful analysis of the reports to the Commission, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the operating revenues have about operated the plant and taken care of all maintenance and paid the above dividends referred to. If the dividends paid were spread over the entire life of the plant, that is, from 1902 down to the present time, the average rate of APPLICATION NO. 3011 </seg>
            <seg id="p258">260 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT dividends would be much less than the 9 r c referred to. It is' impossible to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, because the company charged its stockholders only 50 cents per month from 1902 to 1909, and the non - stockholders $1.00 per month, the stockholders receiving their phones at 50 cents a month and allowing the other 50 cents to stand in lieu of dividends. The reports to the Commission are so meager that it is im - possible to tell the amount that has been spent for maintenance, deprecia - tion, taxes, losses and damages, operating expenses, extensions and bet - terments, set out in separate items?. The engineering department of the Commission has made a study of the properties and report a present value of the properties of $10,093.22. This would indicate that there is a value in the properties above the outstanding stock amounting to $2,718.22, with a present indebtedness of $1,596.24. which would bring the total liabilities outstanding to $8,971.24. This would still leave an equity in the plant of $1,121.98 above present outstanding liabilities. The com - pany contends that it has collected $1,600 in advance from its subscribers, which has all been spent. This would leave the company short the dif - ference, between the $1,121 98 and the $1,600, which amounts to a shortage of $47S.02. The company further contends that, owing to the high prices of materials for maintenance of their properties 1 and labor in reconstruc - tion work and operators' wages, their operating expenses are at this time greatly increased and will continue to increase should they attempt to reconstruct their lines to a standard that will render adequate service for the future. While the accounts are not such to enable the Commis - sion to make a definite finding, the Commission is 1 convinced that it is necessary to increase the rates, but is of the opinion that the operating revenues should be conserved for the use ar.d benefit of the telephone ervice. and that the company should be restricted to a 6'i dividend upon the outstanding stock, which amounts to $7,375. Should the reve- nues prove to be more than U' necessary, the rurplus will then stand for the use and benefit of the public, and should Ihe surplus become greater than is necessary the rates can be accordingly reduced. The Commission finds that the company is not keeping its books nor reporting to the Commission in as complete detail as it sliould. that the Commission might be fully advised as to all of the operating revenues and the disbursements of same, and until this time the Commission will restrict the divedends to •»'* upon the $7,375. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Cqm : mission that the applicant herein be authorized to publish and collect $1.25 for all residence telephone service and $1.50 for business telephones. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the app'i' ant shall keep its account* in accordance with the adopted system tppr .ved by the Railway Com - mission, which is shown in detail by the annual report blanks now in the possession of the company which have been furnished it by the Com - mission. </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 261 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, as a condition of the rate increase, the company shall not pay out dividends greater than 6 r ; upon $7,375, which is represented by ouls.anding stock to that amount.

Browne, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATIONS NOS. 066, 3L-98 AND 3461 In the Matter of the Application of the Lin - coln Traction Company for Authority to Increase Its Fares and to Issue and Sell Securities. Appearances For Applicant— Attorneys F. M. Hall, E. J. Hainer and L. A. Rickett For City of Lincoln — Attorney C. Petrus Peterson. )PINION AND FINDINC HALL, Chairman The Lincoln Traction Company, applicant herein, was organized for the purpose of consolidating all properties, facilities and services of Lincoln Traction Company, Citizens Railway Company and Citizens In - terurban Company. The consolidation and organization was effected February 1, 1909, and all properties, facilities and assets of the three old companies were turned in to the consolidated company, which as - sumed and took up all outstanding liabilities of the three companies in accordance with a consolidation agreement. "Lincoln Traction Company" was the old company, which was a re - organization effected in 189S, and existed from that time until the con - solidation above referred to in 19"9. It will be referred to in this opinion as the "old company." The Citizens Railway Company and the Citizens Interurban Company were new competing companies. The Citizens com - pany began operation in October. 1906, and the Interurban early in 1908. In the consolidation they were treated a&gt;' one company and will be re - ferred to in the opinion as the "Citizens compary." The Lincoln Trac - tion Company, the consolidated company, will be referred to as the "new company." A receiver was in charge of most of the street ear lines of Lincoln during the years of 1895, 1896 and 1897. Lincoln Traction Company, re- </seg>
            <seg id="p260">262 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT ferred to herein as the old company, was organized for the purpose of taking over of all properties, facilities and services that were in pos - session and control of the receiver. When the organization was com - pleted the old company issued securities to the holders of liabilities against the properties in the possession of the receiver in the following amounts:— $100,000 in 57c bonds; $622,500 67c preferred stock; $217,050 common stock; making a total outstanding capital securities' issue of $940,000. From the time of the organization of the old company in 1S98 to the time of the organization of the new company, February 1, 1909, the liabili - ties were increased to the following amounts: — The $100,000 in bonds was increased to $250,000; the preferred stock was increased $77,500; making a total of outstanding preferred stock, $700,000. The common stock was increased from $217,050 to $330,000. This makes a total of capital Securi - ties outstanding of the old company February 1, 1909, of $1,280,000. At this point we wish to call attention to the fact that the old com - pany owned and operated in conjunction with its street car facilities a light and power distributing plant, which was represented in the above mentioned outstanding securities, the light and power facilities all hav - ing been installed out of the surpluses of the traction company and from money borrowed. The old company, through its officers, in 1902 organized another company known as the "Heat, Light and Power Company." This com - pany issued $71,000 of 67c bonds at 90 cents and issued all its stock, amounting to $150,000, to the old company upon the condition that the old company would furnish exhaust steam for heating purposes for a period of twenty years'. The Heat, Light and Power Company is, in fact, only a steam heating plant, which operates in the business center of the city and does not own any light and power facilities, nor does it own a heat generating plant, its property consisting of distributing facilities. This will be sufficient to show that the old company actually own?d and operated all street car. light and power, and heating facilities under consideration at the time of the reorganization, February 1, 1909. During the period of operation of the old company, from 1898 to 1909, new and distinctly competing companies, known as the Citizens Street Railway Company and the Citizens Interurban Company, respectively, were organized, and new properties were installed, and were put into operation as follows: The Citizens Street Railway Company lines in October, 1906, and the Interurban facilities early in the year 1908. Both properties of the old company and the Citizens company (and using the term Citizens company here we refer to both the Citizens company and the Interurban) operated under strong competitive conditions until Feb - ruary 1, 1909, when the Lincoln Traction Company, referred to herein as the "new company," was organized and took over all properties, facilities' and services of the old company and the Citizens company. The old company and the Citizens company entered into a consolida - tion agreement by which they were to turn over their properties and aastets to the new organization, which was as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 263 First, the new company assumed the $250,000 of a' r bonds, above referred to, of the old company and took up the outstanding $700,000 six per cent preferred stock of the old company with an issue of $77,000 of five per cent bonds of the new company. The $70,000 difference was premium given in considera ion of the reduction of interest from six per cent on the preferred stock to five per cent on the bonds. This made the total bonded indebtedness of the new company February 1, 1909, $1,020, - 000. which, except as to the $70,000, was in fact a liability entirely of the old company. The equities in the properties of the old company above this bonded indebtedness was represented by $330,000 of common stock as above shown. Second, the consolidation agreement provided that the Citizens com - pany stockholders should receive for their stock six per cent preferred stock of the new company. In fact, the Citizens ccrrpany did not have any bonds or stock outstanding, but their interests were represented by book accounts of the compapy for actual money pa : d into the treasury, and the new company issued its six per cent preferred stock to the so - called stockholders of the Citizens company and determined the amount of stock to be issued by taking the book accounts for money paid in and adding seven per cent interest on the payments to the total amount paid in, which made a total of $332,000. To this amount was added twenty - five per cent bonus, which amounted to $83,000, making a total of pre - ferred stock issued by the new company, to the stockholders of the Citizens company, of $415,000. Whil? the consolidation agreement pro - vided that the stockholders in the Citizens company should receive pre - ferred stock at par in the new company, the above statement shows what was actually done. It will be observed that this stock, while it is. 1 a six per cent cumulative stock on the face of it, is seven and a half per cent on the actual investment, that is, six pc? cent on the $415,000 is seven and a half per cent on the $332,000, which was the actual investment of the Citizens company stockholders at the time of the consolidation plus seven per cent interest. At the time of the consolidation no inventories or depreciation stu - dies of any of the properties of either of the companies were made, but the Citizens lines were practically new and they had the exact cost as a basis to stand on. The next thing then to be determined was the relative value of the equity in the old company's properties as represented by the $330,000 of common stock outstanding as compared with the $415,000 of preferred stock to be issued to the Citizens company stockholders. Taking the amount of preferred stock in the new company issued to stockholders in the Citizens company as a measure, the new company settled with the common stockholders of the old company by giving them, in lieu of their $330,000 of common stock, $660,000 of preferred s'tock in the new company, thus making a total issue of six per cent preferred stock of the new company of $1,075,000, which, in fact, as measured by the actual dollar investment in the Citizens company, is a seven and a half per cent stock. We now have outstanding liabilities of the company as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p262">264 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT February 1, 1909, bonds $1,020,000 (Six per cent par value or seven and a half per cent on investment) — Preferred stock 1,075,000 Total $2,095,000 Third, we come now to another provision in the consolidation agree - ment, which in our opinion more vitally affects the interests of the public as to rates, service and stability of the securities issued by the new company than any other condition in the agreement. If the new company had limited its capitalization February 1, 1909, to the $1,020,000 in bonds and $1,075,000 in preferred stock and only in - creased those iss'ues as the development of the facilities needed new capital and as additional moneys were paid into the company for addi - tional bonds or stock, there would have been no one to absorb a surplus, should any accrue, after the interest on the bonds and dividends on the preferred stock were paid. They agreed to divide the surplus, should there be any, on the basis, of what they estimated the relative earning power of the two old companies to be, so by the terms of the contract, which were in this respect performed to the letter, the new company issued to the stockholders of the Citizens company common stock to the amount of eighty per cent of the $415,000, which was to be issued in pre - ferred stock. This made an additional issue of common stock to the Citizens stockholders of $332,000. The holders of the $330,000 common stock in the old company, although they had already received, according to the contract, $660,000 preferred stock in the new company, received also in common stock of the new company 400&lt;7 c of the $330,000, or $1, - 320,000, making a total of common stock in the new company of $1,652, - 000. This was to be the sponge to absorb any and all surpluses' that might accrue after all operating expenses, maintenance, depreciation, taxes, losses and damages, interest on the bonds, and dividends on the preferred stock had been taken care of out of the operating revenues. Certainly such methods' of financing should not be approved by this Com - mission. Since the consolidation the new company has, by authority of the Commission, increased its bond issue from I he $1,020,000 to $1,500,000 and its preferred stock from $1,075,000 to $1,186,700. The matters under consideration herein involve the application of the new company to increase its charges for passenger transportation (Application No. 3066) and Applications Nos. 3289 and 3461 for authority of the Commission to sell additional preferred stock to the amount of $231,199.71, the proceeds of which are to reimburse its treasury for money taken from the operating revenues and spent in the construction of addi - tions and betterments, and also to pay certain outstanding notes, the proceeds of which were used in the construction of additions and better - ments. The Commission is of the opinion that the $281,199.71 should be capitalized, as the money has been expended for items properly chargs - able to capital. This matter will be discussed later, but we mention it at this time to show how closely the question of additional capital :s </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 connected with the rate question. Because of the bearing that the sur - plus in possession of the company, earned from past operating income, has on the making of rates to be paid, we have consolidated all the three applications and the finding and order will dispose of the entire matter. Before we attempt an analysis of the operating revenues of the ap - plicant we wis,'h to be understood as fully appreciating the reciprocal obligation of the utility on the one hand and that of the rate-paying public on the other hand. — that it is the duty of the utility to render at all times adequate service and that the public should pay average rates for such service, sufficient to pay all operating expenses, maintenance and depreciation, obsolescence, taxes, losses, damages, and a fair return on the property devoted to the public use, and representing a sacrifice by the owners of the property. The utility is charged with the duty of paying such wages and salaries necessary to attract employees so skilled in the particular line of their employment that adequate service may be rendered the public, — it must keep its facilities in practically 100% service efficiency whether the price of material be high or low. All of these expenditures must be provided for out of the rates through years of success and those of adversity. Over and above the enumerated ex - penses and return, reserves must be created sufficient to tide the com - pany over periods of adversity, whether caused by increased operating expenses or depression in operating revenues. When the public has paid rates sufficient to provide funds for the above enumerated purposes, in our opinion it has done its full duty. If the public has done more than this it has done more than its duty; if less, it has done less than its duty. Standing squarely upon these prin - ciples, we will now take an account of the operating revenues of the company and their disbursements from February 1, 1909, the date upon which the consolidated properties began operation, to December 31, 1917. In considering the operating revenues and their disbursements we must keep in mind that the Lincoln Traction Company, referred to as new company, is not only a street car company but it is also a light and power company. The light and power facilities constitute a part of the assets of the new company and are represented by the same liabilities that cover the street car facilities, and none other. The new company is also in fact a heating company. The heating facilities were installed by a subsidiary corporation of the old company. It issued all of its stock to the old company, amounting to $150,000, for which no money was paid, but the old company was to furnish steam for heating pur - poses to the heating company for a period of twenty years. The heating company is known as the Heat, Light and Power Company, but, in fact, as stated before, it does not own and operate light and power facilities. The light and power facilities are owned and operated directly by the new company. No physical valuation, no detailed inventories, no de - preciation studies of the three properties devoted to the public service have ever been made. Nor has there ever been an allocation of the fa - cilities devoted to the several services'. We, therefore, will take the entire operating revenues paid by the public for All services rendered for the </seg>

Approximately $24,000 of these bonds were paid off out of the operating income of the old company before the consolidation in 1909. Since the taking over of all facilities in 1909 by the new company the new company has paid off $32,000 of the heat bonds 32,000.00 We now come to two items, not included in the operating expenses as above shown, which are explained as follows: In 1909. when the consolidation was effected, it was found by the Commission that certain properties by reason of the consolidation should be written out of the property account and new property installed in lieu thereof. This amounted to 35,989.20 Dividends on common stock $198, 228.00 Expenditures in extensions and betterments', properly- chargeable to capital but paid out of the operating in- come 317,499.71 ($36,300 authorized but not sold, $281,199.71 unauthorized).

            <seg id="p266">268 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT Brought forward $624,720.0i The other item is one for costs of consolidation, which 18,098.83 amounted to This makes a total disbursement of $642,818.84 It will be noted that this disbursement exceeds the receipts by $4,- L32.67. This is possible because of the fact that there were other mis - cellaneous incomes not accounted for which by far exceed the difference. Among these the chief items are profit on sales of real estate, $ and settlement for an engine, $8,300.00. We now have accounted for the expenditure of the net surplus balance accrued from operating income for the eight years and eleven months and for the expenditure*-,' of the proceeds of the increase in short time notes for the period. The next thing to determine is: What part of the above expenditures should be returned to the surplus account and considered by the Commission as a credit to the public in making rates? The applicant contends that by reason of the consolidation a great service was rendered to the public and a value was put into the proper - ties above the bonds' and preferred stock issued at that time. The consolidation at best only partly cured the evil that had been done in the building of duplicate facilities. However, whatever benefit accrued to the public, the company is not entitled to return upon an additional valuation in the properties by reason of the consolidation, because every dollar of the expenses of consolidation was charged to the rate-paying public. Over and above the direct costs of consolidation, which, as we have shown, amounted to $18,098.83, there was the s&gt;"um of $35,989.20 expended in extensions and unnecessary properties, written out of property accounts by reason of the consolidation, which was also charged to the rate-paying public and has been paid for out of the op - erating income. These two items amount to $54,088.03. Considering this as a proper charge to be borne by the public, the $642,830.84 should be reduced by that amount. The increase in short time notes for the eight years and eleven months, as we have shown above, was $74,064.15, but there was outstanding at the beginning of the period $51,184.45. making a total of outstanding short time notes at the end of the period (December 31, 1917), of $125,248.80. We will now charge the increase up to the rate paying public and deduct it from the $642,818.84 and we have the following: Make deductions above referred to Deduct increase in short time note This leaves a net balance of after all operating expenses, actual money spent on maintenance and depreciation, taxes, losses and damages, expenses incurred in consolida - tion in 1909, expenses of discarding old properties and installing new in lieu thereof, made necessary by reason of the consolidation, $74,064.15 54.0S8.03 $588,730.81 74,064.15 $514,666.66 </seg>

It is difficult in the absence of depreciation and inventory studies to make a specific finding as to the value of the property devoted to the public service that the company is entitled to a return upon; however, taking the bonds, amounting to $1,500,000, and the preferred stock, amounting to $1,186,700, making a total of $2,686,700 as representing the sacrifice of the investor to the public service as a basis for value, and keeping in mind that the original $1,075,000 preferred stock included a twenty-five per cent bonus' for which no money was paid, and also con- sidering the fact that the bonds on their face are five per cent while in fact considering the discount allowed are at least 55 ';; , and that the $1,075,000 preferred stock is in fact a 7.5 r ; stock, based on the invest ment. we find that the $2,686,700 fully represents the fair value of the property, and that when the interest on the bonds and dividends on the preferred stock are paid the investors have received a liberal return on the values of the property that they have devoted to the public service It is contended that the surpluses of the company were not made by the traction end of the business, but rather by the heat, light and power facilities. We again call attention to the fact that the heating facilities were installed out of the surpluses built up out of the traction rates and an issue of $71,000 bonds of the heating company. The traction company operated the facilities and furnished steam for heating purposes without making a charge for steam for seven years. The light and power facili - ties were installed by the traction company and paid for out of its surplus, and as between the railway department and the light and power depart - ment no charge for current furnished was made on the books of the company for a period of ten years. Now the applicant sets its profits from the heat, light and power off into separate funds and contends' that the traction company end of the business is losing money. For the pur - pose of this opinion we will not enter into a lengthy discussion of this phase of the subject, but will do so at the proper time and place should occasion require it. For the purpose of this case we are taking the combined facilities and treating them as a whole. Assuming, in the absence of inventory and depreciation studies of the properties, which the company has never furnished, that the proper - ties in place in 1909 have been kept intact and that all extensions and betterments made since that time have been kept to one hundred per cent service efficiency or new properties installed out of operating revenues equivalent to the depreciation in the properties over and above the cap - ital charges herein referred to, the Commission finds that the sum of $390,502.81 has been invested in extensions and betterments out of the operating income and is a proper capital charge. Of this amount the company now has, by a previous order, the authority to sell $36,300 of preferred stock, which has not been st&gt;ld. The applicant now asks authority to sell $281,199.71. These two items will return to the treasury </seg>
            <seg id="p268">270 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the company $317,499.71, less commission and discount, which will be provided for in the order. It is apparent that the difficulties of the company are due principally in three causes, viz.: (1) The issuance of common stock amounting to $1,652,000 without consideration and the placing of the practical control of the company in the hands of the holders of such stock; (2) the pay - ment of $198,228 under the guise of dividends on the common stock, which was in fact nothing else than the abstraction of so much money from the treasury; (3) the use of reserves, appropriated to other pur - poses, for the building of extensions and betterments' and the expenditure of surplus in extensions and betterments. The last cause has had the effect of rendering the company short of ready cash, but its' effects are only of a temporary nature and will be removed as soon as the company calls the securities as applied for aod authorized herein and by the previous order referred to. The first two difficulties must be squarely faced and wholly over - come, otherwise the present condition will continue to occur. The Commission would not be justified in increasing rates' when the company has on hand a surplus of $514,678.66, $198,228 of which has been paid out wholly without right to the common stockholders. It is apparent from the past conduct of the company that the officers intend to claim for the common stockholders the benefit of any surplus that may accrue. The rates cannot be increased until the $198,228 is' returned to the treas - ury of the company and the company is relieved of having its control held by those who have no interest in it except to get out of it as much as possible. The Commission has no power to enter a judgment for the repayment of the $198,228, nor to order the cancellation of the common stock, — relief of that kind would have to be sought in a court of equity. But the Commission will make no order raising rates until the money is' returned and the common stockholders are shorn of their power to deplete the treasury of the company. It is true that the operating revenues for the calendar year 1917 were insufficient to pay the dividends on the preferred stock by $22,305.83. The increases in operating expenses for the calendar year 1918, by reason of increased wages, cost of materials and supplies and freight rates, may create a greater deficiency, even though the gross' operating revenues re - main constant. We do not advocate the policy of allowing a depletion of the entire surplus reserves, and we are of the opinion that should the reserves continue to be reduced by reason of high cost of operation the Commission should take time by the forelock and raise the rates, but certainly the Commission should not raise the rates and place a greater burden upon the people until the company itself has done its full duty. The Commission will, through the medium of the monthly reports of the applicant, keep In close touch with the operating results for the future, and when the company has done its duty by making good to the public the operating revenues properly belonging to the surplus' account, should the surplus account together with the future operating revenues </seg>
            <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 271 not be sufficient adequately to take care of the company, the Commission will immediately raise the rates. We are therefore of the opinion that the Commission is not justified in increasing the rates at this time, and that the application therefore should be denied.

Browne, Secretary (SEAL) WILSON, Commissioner, Concurring in part APPLICATIONS NOS. 3066, 3298 AND 3461 In the Matter of the Application of the Lin - coln Traction Company to Increase Its Rates of Fares and Issue and Sell Certain Capital Securities. WILSON, Commissioner (concurring in part) I concur in the order dated June 17, 1918, with the exception of the limitation as to the selling price of the securities which should be left out altogether under the circumstances, in my opinion. I also disagree with the majority finding as to the value of the property on December 31, 1917, which I think should be $2,185,6(19.35, in the place of $2,686,700.00 as found by the majority. I fear for the legality of that portion of the order denying an increase of rates in that the majority made no finding as to the value of the property during each of the years' during which the surplus revenue re - lied upon accumulated, which it could have done upon the record. precedent of the exception to the support my position are much more in the majority opinion, I take the and at greater length than I should Because of the departure from order, and because the facts which comprehensive than those set forth liberty of treating the case^ de novo, otherwise wish. The chief allegations of the rate application are that the value of the property used in furnishing railway service is $2,590,094.21; that the revenues applicable to return on such value during the year ending June 30, 1917, amounted to $108,330.75, or 4.18^ of such value; that applicant had $1,500,000 of 5'; bonds and $1,150,400 of %°k preferred stock outstand - ing, the interest and dividends on which amounted to $144,024 annually; and that Die cost of operating and maintaining the property was increas - ing constantly, "leaving not only inadequate returns for the capital in - vested, but nothing to meet unusual and unforeseen conditions and con - tingencies" in the future. The prayer was' for a fair, Just, reasonable and adequate rate, and "such other, further or different order * * • in the premises as may be just and equitable." The rate application was </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 273 protested by the cities of Lincoln, University Place and Havelock, where - in applicant's service is carried on. Protestants denied that the present rates were not compensatory and alleged that applicant has earned out of its' rates during the past years more than sufficient to pay all operating expenses and other charges, including a fair return at all times upon the fair value of the property devoted to public use. The applications for authority to issue capital securities simply re - quest permission to issue bonds or preferred stock "for betterments, ex - tensions and additions to its property, as shown in the itemized statement hereto attached." They were in effect applications for authority to issue preferred stock only, inasmuch as bonds were already outstanding in the full amount of the mortgage upon the property and there is no intention on the part of the applicant to make a second mortgage. The consolidation of the rate application with the capital applications was ordered by the Commission on its own motion over applicant's ob - jection. It was done by reason of the closte relation that should prevail between the capitalization of a public utility, measured by the par value of the securities or by the amount of capital invested, and the value of the property. The law governing the issuance of capital securities by public utilities was designed to protect the rate-paying public against excessive service rates. Evidence as to capitalization and casti invest - ment is always competent in rate cases, and is occasionally the only evidence available as to the value of the property. The law was also designed to protect the investing public against fraud in the sale of the securities'; and if they are to be protected, evidence as to the value of the property is indispensable in matters arising under the law. A new share of stock represents no greater interest in the property than an old share, regardless of what is paid for it, and regardless of whether the payment adds to the value of the property. The entire capitalization of a utility and the value of its property are therefore necessarily before the body charged with the administration of both the law as to securities and the law as to rates. It would be folly, therefore, not to consolidate matters affecting both rates and capitalization that are pending before the Commission. Applicant owns and operates a property which furnishes a fourfold public service — street car transportation, electric lighting, electFic power, and heating. The record title of the heating plant, consisting only of steam mains and meters, is in a corporation named the Lincoln Heat, Light &amp; Power Company, but the plant was originally built with funds of the applicant or its predecessors in interest (subsequently restored, however, from borrowed funds and heating revenues), and the stock of the heating company has always been owned by applicant. The record titles' of the property used for transportation, electric lighting and elec - tric power ;i:v in app'lcant, and this property was built witli the funds of applicant or Its predecessors in Interest, derived from the sale of capital securities and from operating revenues. Tbe grosa revenues from the beating service go Into the treasury of tbe heating company when collected, but the net revenues above the costs of operation and main. </seg>
            <seg id="p272">274 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT tenance computed on a more or less arbitrary basis, plus interest and amortization requirements on heating company bonds, go into applicant's treasury. Revenue from transportation, lighting and power service go directly into applicant's treasnrv The facilities, material*', labor and management required in furnish - ing the fourfold service are commingled to such a degree that it is im - possible to ascertain with any reasonable degree of accuracy the separate costs of each service. The overhead expenses, such as salaries, clerk hire and office rent, are incurred almost altogether on joint account. The electricity used in furnishing the transportation, light and power services is generated by the same machinery, and the steam used in the heating service is generated by the boilers used in producing electricity. The production of electricity and steam is further involved by the use of internal combustion engines with which to run the dynamos in part, it being estimated by applicant's secretary, who is also an engineer, that 45^ of the power produced at present is made by such engines. He also estimated that the heating plant absorbed 1,000 horse power of the total boiler capacity in addition to the exhaust steam. It would require the most elaborate study to even fairly approximate the separate costs of producing the electricity used for transportation, for lighting, and for power purposes, and the steam used for heating pur - poses. The actual cost of construction or value of the property used exclusively in each Service, together with the cost or value of the prop - erty used in common, separated between each service on some more or less hypothetical basis, would be necessary to begin with. Thereafter, the costs of operation and maintenance of the property used exclusively in each service, together with the co&amp;'ts that are common to all services similarly separated. These run from a division of the cost of supplies bought on joint account, on through the division of many expense accounts of the company, such as overhead expenses, wages of plant engineers, linemen and clerks, rent, stationery, pos'tage, and a number of smaller items. As said by the secretary of the company: "The costs are so intermingled that I don't know where you would separate;" and by the Commission's chief accountant, Mr. Powell, who was called by applicant as a witness in its own behalf and who testified that he did not know that the revenue from the stele of light and power produced a net income to the company when all of the elements entering into the cost of pro - duction are taken into consideration, and that "it has always been a ques - tion in my mind if the Lincoln Traction Company would not be better off if it did not have to furnish heat." In previous matters before the Commission involving the applicant studies have been presented as to these separate costs, and tentative figures' representing the costs arrived at but that was before internal combustion engines were added to the power plant, which addition has complicated the field of study very considerably. The same engineers operate both steam and combustion engines, at the same time. Lubricat - ing oils and minor repairs to both classes of engines come from the same </seg>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 275 stock and the load is alternated from one class of engine to the other as judgment required. As the secretary testified further: 'Suppose one of your diestel engines was running along there and suddenly shut down. They will do it. You have to get a boiler on and it is going to cost you money to get it on and it is because of the die- sel engine. ♦ * * * Metering it (the current) separately wouldn't give it (the cost of producing electric current) to you unless you keep all your other expenses separate, as the maintenance of die- sel engines and the labor on diesel engines The Commission in the past has attempted this separation and has fixed transportation rates' thereon, but it did so with considerable hesita - tion by reason of the difficulties referred to. It made this separation for two reasons: — First, to ascertain if the costs of furnishing lighting, power and heating were in excess of the revenues received from those sources, in which event those services would constitute a burden upon the trans - portation service and thus compel street car patrons to pay excessive rates' if the company was to receive a reasonable return on the property used in that service; second, the legal necessity the Commission conceived it was under to regulate the property, over which it had full control as to capitalization, rates and service, to-wit, the railway property, wholly separate from the property used in furnishing the other services 1 , over which it had no control of the rates and service. The question was consiaerea in the case of City of Havelock vs. Lin - coln Traction Company, Third Annual Report of the Commission, page 133. The Commission in that case found that the expenses of operating and maintaining the whole property should be credited with all of the ex - penses directly incurred in furnishing lighting, power and heating service, such as maintaining electric transmission lines and steam mains', and in addition thereto, a share of the common costs, plus a profit, amounting to 2% cents per kilowatt hour for electric current used in the lighting and power service, measured by a meter installed at the power house, and an amount equal to 27 cents for each 1,000 pounds of condensation from steam used in the heating service as measured by the consumer's meters. This was in July, 1910. The several amounts of electricity and steam used in the four services have increased since that time as fol - lows: Transportation, from 375,000 K. W. hours per month in 1910 to 515,000 K. W. hours per month in 1917; lighting and power, from 168,000 K. W. hours in 1910 to 536,000 K. W. hours in 1917; and heating, from 57,821,000 pounds of steam condensation in 1911 to 92,728,000 pounds in 1917. Inasmuch as the only measure which even approximates correct - ness in allocating the values and expenses of property devoted to more than one purpose is' the use basis, which basis was used by the Com - mission in 1910, it is apparent that the allocation used in 1910 will not do now, owing to the greater ratio of use by the lighting, power and steam services over that prevailing in 1910. Applicant admits that the 1910 allocation does not result in charging the heating service with its Just share of common costs, and that the charge should be increased from 27 cents per 1.000 pounds of steam condensation to 40 cents; but </seg>
            <seg id="p274">276 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT it contends that the lighting and power charge fixed in 1910 is equitable, and that transportation rates should continue to be based as heretofore The Commission is' without sufficient information, however, to deter - mine a reasonable charge for steam as well as for electricity used in lighting and power, assuming even that it is possible of ascertainment, and it is therefore obliged to con&amp;'ider applicant's property, revenue and expenses as a whole in passing upon the issues herein. The entire business is included in the is&amp;'ues as to capitalization, of course, and in the transportation rate matter, of necessity, to say the least. Such in - clusion is necessary for additional reas'ons. For over seven years fol - lowing the establishment of the heating service the heating company paid nothing to the applicant or its predecessors for the exhaust steam Used in heating. There is 1 no evidence in the record either as to the amount of steam so furnished during that period or as to what was a reasonable charge for it. And for over ten years no account was kept of the amount of electricity used for lighting and power purposes, and in neither case has' there been any accounting to the transportation department for any part of the surplus accumulated from those sources in those years. The surplus derived from the rates in the past over and above a reasonable return is of prime importance in a rate pro - ceeding. Public utility concerns' accumulate surpluses the same as banking and other large business enterprises, for the purpose of main - taining uniform dividends to stockholders and caring for possible losses or increased costs of doing business. The case of People ex rel. King* County Lighting Co. vs. Wilcox, 210 N. Y. App. 479, is' in point on the sub - ject of a surplus concerning which the court said: "Referring again to the Ames Case (Smyth vs. Ames, 169 U. S., 466) the public is entitled to be served at reasonable rates, and the corporation is entitled to a fair return on the property used by it in the public service, no more, no less, always assuming, of course, that the return is computed on a proper valuation. That was not made so by students, but was the rule at common law, which jus - tifies legislatures and commissions in fixing rates. If then a public service corporation has received more or less than a fair return, it has received more or less, as the case may be, than was its due, irrespective of whether a rate had been fixed by public authority. If a deficiency in the fair return in the early years was due to losses or expenditures which were reasonably necessary and proper in de - veloping efficiency and economy of operation and in establishing a business it should be made up by the returns in later years. If there was a fair return from the start, the corporation has received all it was entitled to, irrespective of how much of the earnings may have been diverted to the building up of the business." The Commission has account of all of the revenues and expenses of the heating, lighting and power departments from the beginning, in addition to the revenues and expenses of the transportation department, since January 1, 1898, all of which will be included in determining the reasonableness of applicant's return in the past, and the existence of a surplus above a reasonable return, if any, for use in maintaining the return in the future and in defraying increased costs of service. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 277 I recognize, however, that cost studies should continue to be made, either by the applicant or by the Commission, as to the electricity and steam usted in the separate services, for the purpose of determining as near as possible the financial return from each class of service, with a view to the Commission allowing a more liberal return to the owners in the event the subsidiary services are particularly remunerative, and thus encourage the utilization of public service plants for various pur - pob'es; or, should such subsidiary services prove to be a burden on the main service of the company, in directing that they be expanded or curtailed in a degree necessary to make them remunerative, or aban - doned when hope of profit is gone. As to the legal necessity of fixing transportation rates based upon the cost of transportation alone: the burden is certainly not upon the Commission, in a proceeding initiated and prosecuted solely by the owner of the utility, as is the instant case, to separate the cost of the service for which an increase of rates is asked, from the cost of the other services. The burden is rather upon the party seeking relief. The Commission is primarily, if not altogether, an administrative court — a body created for the purpose of administering existing laws' relating to common carrieis, and the procedure in effect in other courts should be followed in so far at least as fundamentals are concerned. The burden of proof is one of the fundamentals in every court; in fact, as said by an eminent authority, "The burden of proof is an essential part of every controversy." The term "administrative court" was applied to the Railroad Com - mission of North Carolina by the supreme court of that state in the case of State ex rel. Railroad Commission v. Wilmington W. A W. R. Co., 122 N. C, 877, and the supreme court of Florida in the case of State v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., 66 Fla. 617, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.), t&gt;39, discussed at considerable length the reasons therefor. The respec - tive laws empowering the commissions of North Carolina and Florida are similar to our own Commission Act. Excerpts from the Florida opinion are as follows: "The making by the commissioners of just and reasonable ad - ministrative rules and regulations for intrastate transportation by common carriers is not a determination of what the law shall be, but such rules and regulations ascertain the facts upon which the pre - viously declared law operates in accomplishing a public purpose. The principles of the law fixing the reasonableness of rules and regulations have already been declared by the common law, the statutes and the decisions of the courts; and the authority of the Commissioners is' in administering the law to extend within definitely stated limits and subject to judicial review the facts upon which the law operates within the bounds stated in the statute." Cooper - vilie Coop. Creamery Co. v. Lemon, 163 Fed. 145. "The statutes of the state do not define all the duties of com - mon carriers, but expressly authorize the railroad commissioners to make reasonable and just rules and regulations to carry into effect the legislative purpose to regulate intrastate transportation by com - mon carriers. This authority necessarily includes the power to make </seg>
            <seg id="p276">278 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT all rules and regulations needful or expedient to accomplish the general statutory purpose. The authority of the commissioners is not confined to the re-statement of common law or statutory duties, but it extends to the racking of any reasonab e rules or regulations appropriate to the subject of administration and regulation within the bounds already fixed by law. Modern development of the service requires the application of old legal principles to new circumstances; hence, rules defining duties that have not Veen previously ascer - tained but are determined by existing legal principles are necessary for effective regulation, and these rules may be formulated by ad - ministrative offices within defined limits as an incident to the effec - tive operation and enforcement of existing valid laws." •The rules and regulations must operate within the expressed limitations of the statute." "An arbitrary and unreasonable regulation is not within the authority of the Commission.' The law in effect in Nebraska is quite complete as to the duties of common carriers to the public. There is not much written law on the subject, there being no express requirement as to the furnishing of service excepting as to connections between competing companies long distance telephone service, and there being no express limitation as to rates for service excepting in the cases of joint railway rates and irri - gation rates, wherein the statute reads that they must be reasonable. But the common law from time immemorial has fixed the duties of com - mon carriers as to service — that it must be furnished to all persons applying and at all times when within the power of the owner, up to the point of confiscation of the property, to furnish the service; and as to rates for the service — that they must be just and reasonable at all times, or, as interpreted by the courts, such rates as will yield a revenue sufficient to operate and maintain the property devoted to public use and pay a reasonable return on the fair value thereof. I think that the Commission is subject to this law in all respects and that it acts judicially in administering it. In fact, the Commission Act views the Commission as a court in prescribing that the rules of evidence applicable in suits arising before it "shall be the same as in ordinary civil actions, except as otherwise provided herein" (Sec. 6167, Rev. Stat. for 1915); and the act is silent as to the burden of proof. It would be strange indeed if the Commission were required by law to separate the cost of applicant's transportation service from the costs of furnishing lighting, power and heating services when applicant's own auditor testi - fied that he did not know where to begin to make such a separation in connection with the power plant. There is warrant in law, however, for treating applicant's fourfold utility as a whole in rate regulation, regardless of a complete separation of the property and expenses. Corporations are created by the sovereign power, not for the purpose of vesting certain individuals with extraord - inary privileges and advantages, but primarily for the benefit of the state, it being considered that the special privileges conferred upon the members of the corporation are incidental only to the advantages gained by the state in more efficient conduct of large enterprises. As between </seg>
            <seg id="p277">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 279 a corporation and those with whom it deals privately, the manner of its conduct is usually material, but as between the corporation and the state the actual conduct governs and not merely the formal action of the corporation. The state looks to the substance and not to the form, and where the form materially interferes with action by the state it may and should disregard it, and should consider the business done by the corporation as it was actually carried on. As has already been noted, the furnishing of transportation, light, power and steam by the applicant, or by the subsidiary corporation, the Lincoln Heat, Light &amp; Power Company, is actually conducted as one business and by means of considerable common property. To separate this bu&amp;'iness into four parts wou'd be a large work. The expense of it would be considerable and the result more or less theoretical, and unstable. Inasmuch as the expenses of such a study are a proper charge against the revenues if the state adopts the policy of fixing the rates for each service based wholly upon the coats of that service, the cost of service to the people might be greater in the case of a consolidated utility than in the case of singly owned and operated utilities. The fact that the title to part of the property is in a subsidiary cor - poration, all of the stock of which is owned by the applicant, is immaterial under this view of the law. The Public Service Commission of the First District of New York, in the cas'e of Herman v. Newtown Ga« Company, PUR. 1916-D, 825, is a case in point. The Brooklyn Union Gas Company owned all of the stock of the Xewtown Gas Company, the latter being only a distributing gas company. It and three other distributing com - panies similarly circumstanced are described by the Commission as follows: "They are nothing more than paper corporations, convenient operating divisions of the Brooklyn Union Company, which owns every share of their stock and has advanced every penny invested in them." The Commission held that although the Brooklyn company was not technically a party to the proceeding before the Commission, involving the rates charged by the Newtown company, the Commission could de - termine whether or not the price charged for gas delivered by the Brook - lyn company to the Newtown company was reasonable, saying further: "Now, it may be urged that because the Brooklyn Union Com - pany is not technically a party to this proceeding we cannot ques - tion- the price it charges the Newtown company for gas. If the New - town company were an independent company, distributing gas which it had bought at the best price it could get from one of two or more sources, and if its contract had been previously made, the power of the Commission to consider such price and determine its rate to consumers would be one question and a very different one from that involved here, but here is a chain of companies under one common ownership. What is paid by the subsidiary to the pirent company is a matter of bookkeeping. Whether the profits appear as earnings by the Brooklyn Union Gas Company or as earnings by the Newtown company, they are equally beneficial to the investors and </seg>
            <seg id="p278">280 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT equally available for the payment of dividends to stockholders of the Brooklyn Union Company. What is taken from one pocket i» simply put into another pocket." Other cases of public regulation of utility rates could be cited wherein the revenues received from by-products and miner services were included in computing the return. The work of regulating public service rates is highly c omplicated and tedious at best. The separation of costs sought in the instant cas'e would probably double the work of the Commission in the case. Treating the business as a whole simplifies the work considerably, and I am not sensi - ble of any disadvantage to the applicant where as a part of the plan it is promised a return sufficient to encourage diversification of products. Manifestly the showing necessary under the method would be materially less than for separate rate-making. I do not wish to be understood, how - ever, as taking the position that the costs of applicant's transportation service, when actually found, if ever shall alone determine its rates for transportation, but rather that the costs of all of its services is a proper basis, with the profit from subsidiary services as a basis of special reward in the way of a larger percentage of return upon the whole property. Applicant offered no evidence as to the present value of its propert&gt; excepting the statements of its president and secretary, supported only by the books of account from February 1, 1909. and certain previous findings by the Commission and by its accounting department. The pres - ident states that the actual physical value was from $3,200,000 to $3,300, - 000 (being equivalent, as he remembered it, of the book value), and the latter saying that the value was less than the book value to the extent of existing depreciation, placing the depreciation at from ten to fifteen per cent of the book value. Other testimony of applicant's officials, de - veloped a greater depreciation than thus indicated by the secretary, de - tailed substantially as follows: Buildings are in eighty per cent condi - tion of cost; power plant is "even above that, with exception of the boil - ers;" the trackage in many places is in poor condition, especially in paved districts; cost of reconstruction immediately necessary of two sections of double track, aggregating 4,385 feet in length, $27,860.50; estimated cost of necessary expenditures on roadway and track in 1918, $40,100.90, compared with $23,169.81 in 1917; rolling stock in fifty-five or sixty per cent condition; average age of all rolling stock, twelve years, compared with the average life of buch equipment of twenty years; light - ing and power facilities, in about seventy per cent condition; heating facilities, about eighty per cent; railway properties has depreciated since the year 1912 between $150,000 and $200,000— from six to eight per cent of book value; all properties' have gradually run down since that year because of greater age. The company keeps no record of the ages of the several classes of its property, or of the units entering into them, excepting rolling stock, but Admits that such a record would be highly advantageous In arriving; at the physical condition per cent pf the property.

Consequently the evidence as to depreciation consists largely of esti - mates based on casual observation of the property only, but coming as it does from applicant's officials solely, the presumption is that the amount of depreciation is' not over-estimated. Counsel for the city of Lincoln at the close of applicant's testimony moved for an order requiring applicant to supply an inventory of its property, sufficiently specific to enable the city's representatives to locate the respective parts in checking the inventory, and showing further the original cost of the property in detail, the length of time the various parts had been in use, and their present physical condition in terms of per - centage. Applicant strongly resisted the motion on the ground that It was practically impossible to show the ages of the various parts of the property, or their original cost: That it would require six months to make the inventory and an expenditure of from $12,000 to $15,000 of the company's funds; that an inventory and valuations "would simply open the door for speculative opinions on the subject;" and that the city of Lincoln was dilatory in not having filed the motion previous to the hearing. The hearing upon the emergency application commenced Sep - tember 14, 1917, and upon the permanent application on February 19, 1918, whereas the motion for an inventory was made on March 5, 1918. Applicant also contended that it had the right to present its case in its own way, and stated that it was' willing to submit its case on the record made by it. declaring also that an emergency existed in its financial affairs which necessitated an early decision by the Commis - sion. The Commission was disposed to grant the motion for the reason that in the absence of an inventory and valuation the record did not show anything in detail a ■ to the quantities of property used in the service, no very dependable data as to its' condition per cent, and nothing as to its tost beyond a book value built upon a "value for rate-making purposes" of the railway property and the lighting and power properties only, adopted by the Commission in 1907, plus the cost of additions and bet - terments to the property from January 1, 1907, to January 1, 1918, as reported to the Commission in annual reports or testified to by company officials' in the instant case, plus a book value of the plants of the Citizens Railway and Citizens Interurban companies when consolidated with ap - plicant's property February 1, 1909, and plus book value of the lighting, power and heating properties. The total book value on January 1, 1918, on this basis was $3,143,396.04, of which $1,400,000 represented the Com - mission's valuation in 1907. The Commission had before it in 1907 (Formal Complaint No. 3. First Annual Report, page 81) an inventory of the railway property then in place, prepared partly by the city of Lincoln and partly by one of applicant's predecesstors, then the owner — the old Lincoln Traction Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p280">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT ■:H2 pany, upon which it found the reconstruction new value of the property to be $1,100,000 and the rate- making value $1,400,000. No allowance was made for depreciation, notwithstanding the company admitted to a depreciation of over $200,000 in trackage and rolling stock alone and the addition of $300, U00 to the reconstruction new value was for good will or going value without legal foundation in the record. Why no allowance was made for depreciation at that time and the actual value of the physical property not found, is unexplainable as the generally accepted rule of commissions and courts in rate cases at that time was to do so; but the allowance for good will or for going value excepting where the costs of those elements of value are shown to have come from stockholders, was not condemned by commissions and courts until later. There was no evidence before the Commission in Formal Complaint No. 3 as' to such costs. The reconstruction new value then found also ap - pears to be excessive from the fact that the company claim of $1,151,672 as, that value included $696,111" for tracage and overhead construction, based on estimates largely, whereas the city returned only $454,670 for those items based upon an engineer's inventory in the field; and con - siderable rolling stock not used in the service because worn out or obsolete was also included in the cost new figures. At any rate an in - ventory and valuation of less than one-half of the property now in use, made more than ten years ago, is of little value in determining the extent and value of the property now, anl I am of the opinion that applicant fell short of disclosing the facts necessary to relief, and possibly of the burden of proof resting upon it. The material evidence as to value in rate cases is described in the first considerable matter of that nature considered by the United States Supreme Court, in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S., 466, as follows: "In order to ascertain that value the original cost of construc- tion, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity under particular rates prescribed by the statute, and the sum re - quired to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each casSe. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be re- garded in estimating the value of the property." The scope of the inquiry in rate cases has broadened since this initial decision so as to include the cost or value of the property at regular in - tervals in its history, the earning capacity or income from operation at such intervals, the amount set aside from revenues for deferred or un - realized depreciation, the fixed charges or dividends paid upon securities outstanding against the property, the character of the management as to honesty and prudence, and other minor matters. In addition to the evidence as to value introduced by applicant, as above noted, it offered the character and amounts of capital securities outstanding, and the interest and dividend charges thereon, the present earning capacity of the property, the sum required to meet operating expenses, the unexpended balance of the amount set aside from revenues </seg>

It is therefore apparent that applicant fell far short of supplying the Commission with all of the evidence material to the issues in this catie, and the Commission would have sustained the city of Lincoln's irotiofi but for the fact that the Commission itself was' in a position to supply enough of the missing matter to make necessary findings, which it did, as will appear later herein. The Commission also considered in overruling the motion, that there was no legal restraint to the Commission proceeding upon its own motion after the disposition of the instant case, and in a new proceeding, instituted by the Commis - sion, to require applicants to make aid file with the Commission an in - ventory of its properLy as contemplated by the motion, to which the sug - gestion of record in th3 case by the Commission, the applicant took no ex - ception and in fact agreed to. By incorporating in the record herein all or the evidence taken in fifteen previous matters before the Commission to which applicant or its predecessors in interest was a party, all of the annual reports of ap - plicant and its predt censors in interest to the Commission, a portion of the record in the case of Sampson v. Lincoln Street Railway Com - pany in the United Slates Circuit Court, District of Nebraska, and parol evidence of the Commission's own procurement, the Commission is able to find that value of the property on January 1, 1898, and on January 1 of each succeeding year, on a cost-less-depreciation basis, the net income from operation remaining after the payment of the expenses' of opera - tion, maintenance, taxes, losses, damages and interest on current bor - rowings, including the unexpended balance of the amount set aside for deferred or unrea'ized depreciation, for each of the twenty years, the amounts of annual return due the owner at 77c per annum of the value of the property, ard the successive additions of the remaining profits to a surplus fund to prc perly care for the property and its' owner in lean income years; also the disposition actually made of the net income by the owner. The details of this evidence will be shown later herein. The amount o: applicant's outstanding securities, measured by their par values, furnish no criterion of the value of the property. It repre - sents a case not only of original watering but of successive waterings from the beginning in 1889 until the enactment of the public utility stocks and bonds law in 1909. One self-administered squeeze appears in the history of tl e property, brought about in 1898 by the determination of the first mortgage bondholders to control the property. Emerging from a three-year receivership on January first of that year the property came into the possession of the holders' of first mortgage bonds in the sum of $600,000, v. ho reduced junior outstanding securities from $2,060, - 000 to $215,000; but this was not a bone dry amendment as will appear later herein. Th ■ property was purchased at receiver's sale in De - cember, 1897, by a committee representing the first and second mortgage bondholders of th &gt; Lincoln Street Railway Company (the owner from 1889 to that time), for the s'um of $60,000. The first mortgage was in </seg>
            <seg id="p282">284 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT the sum of $600,000 and the second mortgage $860,000 There appears also to have been outstanding $200,000 of preferred stock and $1,000,000 of common stock, but there is nothing in the record as to the amount of moneys paid into the treasury of the company when any of the securi - ties were issued, nothing as to the use made of the company's funds, and nothing as to the cost or value of the property, at that time. The bondholders' committee created a new corporation to take over the property on January 1, 1898, known as the Lincoln Traction Com - pany. The organizers planned the issuance of $100,000 of first mortgage 5% bonds; $700,000 of 5% preferred stock and $365,000 of common stock, as' follows: The bonds to be sold at par with a bonus of 50^ in preferred stock; preferred stock — $600,000 to be issued to the old first mortgage bondholders; $50,000 to be issued as a bonus to bond purchasers and $50,000 to be sold for cash; common stock — $215,000 to be issued to old second mortgage bondholders and $150,000 to be sold to old preferred stockholders at seven cents on the dollar, and to old common stockhold - ers at ten cents on the dollar. There were $115,000 of delinquent taxes against the property (later settled for $60,000), and $45,000 of bond - holders' committee expenses&gt;" incurred during the receivership, which taxes and expenses the organizers treated as incumbrances against the property in fixing sale prices of the new securities. As the plan worked out only $45,000 of the bonds could be and were sold at the beginning, the proceeds of which were used to pay the com - mittee expenses referred to; of the preferred stock $600,000 were issued to the old first mortgage bondholders, $22,500 as' a bonus to bond pur - chasers and $49,500 sold for cash at twenty-five cents on the dollar; of the common stock, $215,000 were issued to old second mortgage bond - holders and only $2,050 could be and were sold to old preferred stock - holders at seven cents on the dollar. The earliest evidence of the value of the property is that of the earnings' and expenses of the property in 1895. which were respectively $104,955.06 and $91,320.11, leaving a net income from operation of $13, - 634.95. The net incomes for the years 1896 and 1897 follow, which were respectively $9,681.85 and $10,548.85, or an average net operating income for the three years of $11,288.55. This was under the receivership. The receiver paid $4,677.66 for insurance, taxes and materials used in repairs, which reduced the net income available for unrealized depreciation and return to owner, to $9,729.33 per annum. Before the advent of public regulation of utilities, net income was good evidence as to the market values of securities, but it has never been considered reliable as to the value of the physical property. Such evidence is of little value in a rate proceeding, inasmuch as rates are based upon the cost of the service, which includes a return either upon the stockholders' investment or upon the value of the property used in the service irrespective of earning power. To include earning power as' an element of value in rate - making is to work in a circle and in an opposite direction to the true one, the rates going down with a decrease of earning power and up with an increase. </seg>
            <seg id="p283">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 285 The next evidence in point of time as to the value of the property is the receipt taken by the receiver from the purchasers of the property, which is in considerable detail and quite complete as to the extent of the property. The trackage shown in the receipt consists of 5.31 miles of double track and 14.02 of single track in use, and approximately 4.85 miles' of single trackage that had been abandoned, the principal parts of which were a line from 9th and J streets in the city of Lincoln to West - ern Normal College, and a line from 16th and P streets to 18th and Vine streets in the city of Lincoln. No account was taken in the receipt for turn-out tracks nor of the respective amounts of trackage in paved and unpaved streets. Recasting the trackage on this basis and according to the showing in that respect made to the Commission in 1907 (Formal Complaint No. 3), and assuming that the proportions between trackage in paved and unpaved streets was the same in 1898 as in 1907, to-wit: forty and sixty per cent, respectively, the trackage of the company on January 1, 1898, in sing'e track equivalent appears to have been as fol - lows: 10.68 miles in paved streets and 16.53 miles in unpaved streets. The abandoned trackage was subsequently torn up by the company and the materials used in reconstruction. The extent of the trackage in use in 1898 was 9.1 miles less than the trackage in 1907. Applicant's president (Mr. Sharp) testified in 1907 that the cost new to the Citizens' Street Railway Company, of which he was then president, of its line complete ready for operation was about $16,985 per mile in paved streets and $8,500 per mile in unpaved streets. On this basis the reconstruction new value of the trackage in 1898 was $321,904.80. The city of Lincoln's valuation engineer returned an average reconstruction new value of $12,796.60 per mile in 1907, including trackage in both paved and unpaved streets. Upon this basis the reproduction new value of the trackage in 1898 was $348,208.28. Nothing was allowed in Mr. Sharp's testimony for engineering, interest during construction and overhead expenses, and nothing was allowed for engineering in the city of Lincoln's return, which its expert admitted should be 5% of all other costs. The city of Lincoln's valuation appears to be the fairer of the two, and adding 695 thereto for engineering, or $17,410.40, we have $365,618.65 as' the reproduction new value of the trackage in 1898. De - ducting whatever depreciation was in the property will give its fair value at that time. Mr. M. L. Scudder was the president of the Lincoln Street Railway Company for a number of years. He was chairman of the bondholders' committee of that company, and he became president of the Lincoln Traction Company organized to take over the property. He testified before the Commission in 1907 (F.C.No. 3) as follows: "When we took it (the property) in 1898, it was very much run down. It had not been repaired at all, but the people who took the property in 1898 are the same who had the property in 1889 when it was new. They took the stock in the new company and it is a con - tinuation of the old ownership; ♦ * * * the property has been renewed pretty thoroughly; tracks relaid with heavier rails largely; twenty cars running in 1898, thirty-one or thirty-two cars now with, </seg>

I think we have two engines there that we had in the beginning, but everything else is new; the capacity of the plant is now doubled to what it was in 1898." And as to the relation of the amount of securities issued to the value of the property, Mr. Scudder testified as' follows: Q. "Did the amount of this preferred stock, this 1100,000 of bonds, and $365,000 of common stock have any reference to the values of the plant at the time of foreclosure, or did it relate entirely to the amount of securities that were out?" A. "I don't know. Of course, we were interested in the value of the plant and we discussed it and its earning power and all that, and it probably had something to do with it." Q. "Do you think this preferred stock and these bonds and this common stock were based on what you thought was the value of the common stock at that time?" A. "No, that was not so because the plant had deteriorated very much during the receivership." Q. "And was' very much less than the amount of the stock and bonds?" A. "No, I don't mean that at all. We didn't value it in that way." Q. "You did not take this into consideration the value at all?" A. "We took into consideration the earning power which was very much declined owing to hard times and the receivership." Q. "And the whole plant was run down badly, the power plant and the equipment?" A. "The deterioration was, of course, very great but that didn't have anything to do with our fixing the amount of the stock, you know. That was a minor consideration, if any at all." Q. "The issues of stocks was' based on the amount of previous securities?" A. "The hope was that times would change and that we might get back to the old conditions when the investment was first made." Q. "Did I understand you, then, that the stocks and bonds were issued on the bas'is of what had previously been outstanding in the way of stocks and bonds?" A. "That must have been it because you can see it was based on the old first mortgage and second mortgage, and the old preferred stock and the common stock." The evidence in that proceeding also showed the following annual expenditures for reconstruction of the trackage and power house equip - ment from 1898 to 1906 inclusive, $156,689.47 of which was' expended on trackage and $3,088.68 on power house equipment: 1902 5,628.72 Total $159J78.15 1903... 14.363.00 If the repairs made to the trackage made it as goo&lt;l as new, the de - preciation, measured by the cost of the repairs, was 42.85 r ; of the re - construction new value above.

As to the company's 1 rolling stock in 1S98, though the company was operating only twenty cars regularly, the receiver delivered to the pur - chasers sixteen double motor closed cars bought in 1893; twenty single motor closed cars, which had been rebuilt by the company; fourteen trail cars; one private car; two fiat cars; one snow sweeper car, and thirty-three car bodies. Thirty-three ot these closed cars appear in the 1907 inventory equipped with double motors, the cost of which is given at $1,000. The cost of the trail cars in the 1907 inventory is given as $400 each; the private car $1,000; the flat cars $600 each, and the snow sweeper $1,000. No mention is made of the car bodies in the 1907 in - ventory. Applying these values to the rolling stock of the company in The power house equipment, according to President Scudder, was iu very bad condition.

However, much of the old equipment was used for from three to six years following January 1. 1898. The equipment had a greater value in 1898 than the differences noted as to 1907. It would be fair to estimate the value of the equipment in 1898 including supplier, which were very meager according to the receiver's receipt, at $60,000. Real estate and buildings delivered to the purchasers in 1898 appears to have consisted of about ten lots in block 102, city ot Lincoln; a brick one-story power house 90x150 feet in dimensions; a brick two-s'tory car house 100x134 feet; and an iron covered storage shed 40x150 feet. The power house was torn down and a new one erected s'hortly after the new corporation took charge at a cost of $30,000. The company claimed that the value of all of its real estate in 1907, including the power house and machine shop, was $130,265, which included the cost of constructing other 1898 the cost new thereof irf as follows: 36 closed cars at $1,000 each * $36,000.00 14 trail cars at $400 each 5,600.01' 1 private car 1,000.00 2 flat cars at $600 each _ 1,200.00 1 snow sweeper car 1,000.00 33 car bodies estimated at $200 each 6,600.00 $51,400.00 The company in 1906 voluntarily charged the sum of $20,000 to protit and loss on account of depreciation in this equipment, but attaching a liberal condition per cent to these cars in 1898, to-wit: 80 per cent, re- sults in a value of $41,120.00. </seg>

Deducting the cost of these additions from the 1907 value and assuming that the appreciation of $17,600 in real estate above cost shown in the 1907 inventory, offset the depreciation in the buildings from 1898 to 1907, which it undoubtedly does in full measure, the value of the company's real estate and buildings in 1898 was $61,715. A summary of these 1898 values is as follows: Trackage, including overhead construction $219,371.20 Rolling stock 41,120.00 Power house equipment 60,000.00 Real estate and buildings 61,715.00 Total $382,206.20 There is much additional evidence in the record corroborating the above values, such as the specific cost of reconstructing parts of the trackage and the voluntary action of the company in charging to profit and loss the sum of $194,120.03 expended for the repairs above shown, including $20,000 for depreciation in rolling s'iock, $20,000 for depreciation in the power house, and $600 for cost of special financial reports.

            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 289 I think that the Commission would be fairly liberal in finding that the value of the entire property on January 1, 1898, was $382,200.20. The Commission has a complete account of the costs of all additions and betterments made to the property from January 1, 1898, to January 1, 1918. To find the value of the property year by year during the twenty years, it remains only to add the cost of the additions and betterments made in each year to the value at the beginning of each year and dedut the depreciation; and in the computation, credit is given for the cost of additions and betterments as of the first of the year in which they were made. It is fair to assume that the depreciation in the property, exempt as it has been from any extraordinary calamity, has been fairly uniform throughout the years, and that the depreciation now found property accrued through the years in proportion to property as thus found. I think that the Commission would bp liberal to the applicant in finding that the property is now in 80'per cent physical condition and that the depreciation in the value of the property as thus measured is 20 per cent, exclusive of the costs of additions and better - ments made in 1917. The finding is justified by the evidence on that subject described above, and by the physical condition of similar other properties concerning which an 80 per cent condition is normal, to say the least The value of the property as of January 1, 1898, plus tl additions and betterments made since that time to January 1, 1917, and exclusive of real estate that has not depreciated, is $2,367,800.36, 2u per cent of which, or $477,860.00, represents the depreciation. This is' ex- clusive of the cost of repairs to the property during the period and rep resents, what is known as unrealized or deferred depreciation. Distribut ing this total depreciation over the twenty years, in proportion to tht value of the property in each year, gives the value of the property each year. These values, and the net income applicable t on basis of a return to the owner at 7 per cent per annum, and a credit surplus of the remainder, together with the actual disposition of this revenue by the owner, are as shown in the following schedul </seg>

            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 The surplus above 7 per cent return shown in the foregoing statement should properly be increased by the $86,000 paid on the principal of heat - ing bonds out of operating revenues, and by the interest paid on those in the record, as the net income shown in the statement is exclusive of bonds and on short time notes, the exact amount of which is not shown of that item. This increases the surplus accumulated during the twenty years to more than $1,100,000 in place of $998,066.43 as shown. Attention is also called to the fact that the return actually paid to the owner of the property as represented by bond and stockholders during the twenty years is $1,962,801.11 or $244,722.56 above a 7 per cent return, and this is exclusive of interest and principal paid on heating bonds. Applicant and its predecessors made additions' and betterments to the plant from January 1, 1898, to January 1, 1918, inclusive of the cur - rent assets, such as tools, supplies, office furniture, prepaid insurance, stock in the Lincoln, Capital Beach &amp;. Milford Railway Company, and cash on hand, at a total cost of $2,280,903.15. During the same period they received moneys from the sale of securities in the amount of $1, - 266,103.76, and from bills and accounts payable outstanding on January 1, 1918, the sum of $229,288.84, or a total of $1,515,482.54. The applicant states that all of its net income, exclusive of interest, dividends and amortization requirements, was used in making additions and better - ments to the property. A check of the total net income for the twenty years with those charges confirms the statement. Deducting the sum of the interest and dividends shown in the foregoing statement — $1,948, - 191.11 — from the total net income of $2,716,144.95 leaves the sum of $707,953.87, which corresponds closely to the difference between the cost of the additions and betterments and the receipts from capital securities, and bills and accounts payable as above noted, which is $765,480.61. There can be no doubt, therefore, of the substantial accuracy of the foregoing statement. Reference has been made to the excessive watering of the securities against the property involved herein. The successive stages of this watering during the last twenty years is shown by the following schedule giving the value of the property as heretofore found, the par amount of outstanding securities, and the actual capitalization computed from the value of the property in 1898. plus all subsequent receipts from the sale of capital securities during each of the twenty years. The statement also shows what a seven per cent return on the actual capitalization would be for each year, compared with the return actually paid in the way of interest and dividends. (Credit is given capitalization as of the first of the year for all additions made during the year.) </seg>

            <seg id="p292">294 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT Deducting tbe total shown in the foregoing statement from the par amount of preferred stock now outstanding — $1,186,700, shows that $681. - 2S1.05 of the stock was "watered" at the time of issuance. Practically all of this can be accounted for in the history of the stock. It appears from the foregoing statement that only $74,318.50 was received by the old company in return for the $330,000 of common stock issued by it. This accounts for $255,681.50 of water. Further, $330,000 of water is ac - counted for by the conversion of this $330,000 of common stock into $650,000 of preferred stock at the time of the consolidation in 1909, and $583,000 is accounted for by the issuance of $415,000 of the preferred stock in return for the stockholders' investment in the Citizens Street Railway and Interurban companies of $332,000. This accounts for $668,681.50 of the water. $2,317.39 of the remainder is accounted for by a discount at which stock was sold under Commission control since July 1, 1909; the balance of $10,252.16 came doubtless from occasional showers. The bonds of the company even are not free from water. They date back in their history to the reorganization in 1898 when they were repre - sented by preferred stock of the old Lincoln Traction Company in the amount of $672,000. According to the value of the property at that time and allowing for the $45,000 of mortgage bonds' then issued, there was $277,150.30 of water in that amount of preferred stock; and coming down to the reorganization in 1909, a premium of $70,000 in the bonds of the present company was given to the holders of $700,000 preferred stock in the old company in exchanging that stock for new bonds, though the rate of dividends on the stock was the same as the rate of Interest on the bonds; and $480,000 of bonds, issued since the reorganization in 1909, were s'old at ninety-five cents on the dollar, though the discount of $2,400 is a proper allowance under the head of interest. Considering the applications for authority to issue $281,199.71 of ad - ditional capital securities in the light of the situation as thus developed, I am compelled to disregard the par amount of outstanding securities, containing as they do $2,711,047.94 of water measured by the actual cap - italization, and $2,193,838.49 of water measured by the value of the prop - erty. I recognize that the par amount of securities outstanding against public service properties should correspond closely with the actual cap - italization and with the fair value of the property, but that would be possible of achievement in such cases only as the Commission has had supervision of from the beginning. Applicant contends that the par amount of securities outstanding has no bearing upon the merits of the applications, either for the issu - ance of additional securities or for increased rates, and that the moneys invested or the value of the property is the proper basis, with which I agree. Deducting the amount of actual capitalization, as shown in the foregoing statement, of $1,668,390.90 from the value of the property on January 1, 1918, of $2,185,609.35, shows that the value of the property in excess of the actual capitalization is $517,209.45, which may be con- </seg>
            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 sidered to be the present value of the property built out of the deprecia tion reserve fund and surplus Applicant is in sore need of funds for several purposes; (1) to repair its property aud to replace some that i»' practically worn out, the cost of which is a proper charge against the deprecTation reserve fund; (2) to pay increased costs of operation in the way of wages and fuel principally, estimated at $46,350 greater for 1918 than were such costs in 1917; and (3) to pay a reasonable return to bond and stockholders up to the amount found reasonable herein. Had applicant issued additional securities for money at the time its additions and betterments were made and in an amount equalling the costs thereof, it would have many hun - dreds of thousands of dollars in cash at present if it had not paid the funds out in increased dividends. The payment of interest and dividends' in excess of the amount found reasonable during the twenty years was, of course, illegal, and particularly is this true of the $198,228 of dividends on common stock in the years 1912, 1914, 1915 and 1916, inasmuch as the common stock represented no investment by the stockholders and no value in the property. The payment of those dividends depleted the prop - erty of the company in that amount and it was unjust not only toward the preferred stockholders who had paid par for stock in recent years, but also unjust to the public who have a beneficial interest in the com - pany's revenues remaining after the payment of all costs of operations, maintenance, taxes, losses, damages, and a reasonable return to bond and stockholders. The amount of these dividends, together with seven per cent per annum from the time of their payment to July 1, 1918, amounts to $242,202.66. I am of the opinion that these dividends and interest thereon should be recovered to the company. This recovery may be a matter of year»', however, and the company is in immediate need of cash funds. I find, therefore, that the applicant is entitled to issue its bonds or preferred stock in the amount of $281, - 199.71 and sell the same at the best prices obtainable therefor, that amount being reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation. But inasmuch as this' is treating the applicant's capital account on the basis of the actual moneys paid into the treasury, applicant should not be permitted to amortize the discount out of operating revenues in comput - ing the return to bond-and-stockholders, the return of 7 per cent per annum upo nthe value of the property, which I think is reasonable, being sufficient to amortize a reasonable discount in addition to a reasonable return on the money paid for the securities. It is' apparent from what has been said heretofore that the applica - tion for an increase of rates should be denied. Referring to Schedule "A" above, applicant is shown to have received, since January 1, 1909, a surplus out of operating revenues over and above the costs of operation, maintenance, taxes, losses, damages, interest and $56,000 of principal paid on heating company bonds, interest on a'hort time notes. $14,610 for cost of abandoned praperty, $98,538.49 set aside for unrealized deprecia - tion, and a return of 7 per cent per annum upon the value of the property, </seg>
            <seg id="p294">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 296 of $518,229.34; and above a return of 7 per cent per annum upon the actual capitalization during those years, after the same deductions are made, the sum of $737,371.06; or for the entire period of twenty years the surplus above the deductions and a 7 per cent return upon the value of the property, is $998,066.43, and $1,280,328.06 upon the actual capitalization, exclusive of heating company bond retirements and the depreciation reserve fund; and even were the interest on bonds and dividends on stock that were actually paid during the twenty years taken as a reasonable return, the surplus above this return would be $767,953.87. The surplus in the latter amount is invested in the property, the present value of which is $517,209.87 — the difference between the value of the property and the actual capitalization. All that applicant needs to do in order to make the surplus available for increased costs of operation and maintenance, and paying interest and dividends to bond-and-stockholders is to actually capitalize the surplus up to its fair value. This would yield $517,209.87. which together with the $242,202.66 due applicant on account of the common stock dividends paid contrary to law, would put $759,412.53 of cash into the treasury. With that amount, applicant could and should liquidate all of its bills and accounts payable of $229,288.84, and maintain a return to bond-and-stockholders of 7 per cent per annum on the fair value of the property for several years to come, despite in - creases in the cost of the service, unless a physical valuation of the property should disclose a greater value than is s'hown herein. Applicant contends, however, that it cannot sell its preferred stock for more than seventy-five cents' on the dollar unless an increase of rates is granted. This is no concern of the Commission under the circum - stances shown in this case. In December, 1917, applicant advertised in the Lincoln newspapers that it would be impossible for it to continue its present service or to improve it on the revenue that it was then receiv - ing, stating that the total operating cost per passenger carried, inclusive of interest on indebtedness was 4.54 cents, whereas the amount received per passenger was only 4.52 cents. It was incomplete in that it made no reference to the surplus accumulated in the past, and it was untrue according to the showing in the instant case. According to the advertise - ment there should have been a deficit of $2,298.09 from applicant's trans - portation service in 1917, whereas applicant showed a net income from this business, after deducting interest, in that year of $25,967.94 based upon a division of the expenses between its transportation, lighting, power and heating services which applicant admits is unfair to the transportation service, loading it with an undue proportion of the total costs. Such an advertisement could not but depress the market prices of applicant's securities. It is an example of imprudent business manage - ment, to say the least, for which neither the Commission nor the rate - paying public is to blame. It can hardly be said to be within the power of the Commission to make rates for the purpose of maintaining the market prices of public utility securities, where by the utility's own act, such prices are depressed and where, as in the instant case, the securi - ties are shown to contain so much water. </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 297 The regulation of public service rates by commissions has proceeded (or years on the theory, assuming that the utility is honestly and pru - dently managed, that the rates' should be sufficient to pay a reasonable return to the owner over and above the co&amp;'ts of operation, maintenance, taxes, losses and damages, and to accumulate a reasonable surplus for the purpose of caring for business depressions and other unforeseen hap - penings, to the end that the owner's' investment should always be main - tamed intact and a reasonable return paid thereon. I would go further than this rule in the instant case by allowing a return upon the value of the property, which value is in excess of the owner's investment shown of record. My reasons for so doing are that the owner's investment from the beginning of the plant is not shown, and I desire to protect as far as possible the holders of preferred stock who have paid par or close to par for the stock in recent years. The remedy for the situation is plain. Applicant should add to its actual capitalization the sum of $281,199.71 represented by its applica - tions' because that amount has been taken from the depreciation reserve and surplus funds and expended in additions and betterments to the property and because the present value of the property is $517,209.87 in excess of the present actual capitalization. Applicant should be per - mitted to sell its capital securities for whatever price they will bring, because it is in urgent need of additional monies, and because the public is concerned only as to the amount of monies entering into the property where the amount of return the owner is entitled to is based upon the value of the property. As to protecting purchasers of the securities, they purchase with notice of the value of the property and the return thereon, as found by the Commission, and cannot complain if they pay more than is warranted by the findings'. The stocks and bonds law cannot be invoked as a guaranty of the capital invested in securities authorized pursuant thereto, under any and all circumstances. To so construe the law would relieve the stock-and-bondholders of responsibility for the proper administration of the corporation and place that burden on the state — a view utterly impracticable and not within the letter or the tfpirit of the act. Applicant should deposit in bank the first proceeds of the additiona. securities in the sum of $98,538.40 for use only in defraying the cost of property replacements on the authority of the Commission, because the financial embarrassment of the company at the present time is partly due to the general use made of the depreciation reserve fund without regard to its' purpose. It should recover into its treasury the common stock dividends paid by it, because there is no doubt as to their illegality — no consideration having ever been given therefor and no value is shown to have been in the property in excess of the securities senior thereto at any time. And the common stock should be cancelled for the sama reason, and for the additional reason that it seriously impairs the credit of the company in that It controls and manage* the company to the detriment of the lecuritiea from which alone it can lecure additional </seg>
            <seg id="p296">298 ELEVENTH ANNbAL REPORT capital, and thus impair the ability of the company to properly discharge its duty to the public. An increase in rates should be denied because applicant is shown to have accumulated a surplus from the rates during the last nine years of not less than $518,239.34 above a return of seven per cent per annum upon the fair value of its property, and, in connection with its nominal predecessors in interest, during the last twenty years, a surplus of not less than $998,066.43 above such return. My reasons for disagreeing with the majority finding as to the value of the property on December 31, 1917, of $2,686,700 is that it is $501, - 090.21 greater than the present value of the property, and that it is based solely upon the par amount of applicant's bonds and preferred stock now in force. The additions to preferred stock of the $281,199.71 herein authorized and the $36,300 previously authorized and not yet issued, will perforce add $317,499.71 to the value of the property on such a basis, though in fact the additions to the property represented by the new stock issues have already been made, and the proceeds of the issues are to be used in maintaining the property and paying a return to bond and-stockholders. And there is no reason why the $42,000 of bonds out - standing against the heating property should not be included al*'o on this basis, all of which would swell the valuation to $3,046,199.71, or $860, - 589.92 more than the value of the property based almost altogether on cost-less-existing depreciation. The majority expressly take the par value of the bonds and pre - ferred stock issued by applicant at the time of the consolidation of the properties' in 1909 as a starting amount for its finding, and does so under the impression that it is bound by the authority subsequently given ap plicant to issue additional bonds and preferred stock, to find a value equal to the sum of such outstanding securities, notwithstanding no evidence as to the value of the property was before the Commission when biich authority was granted, and no finding made as to value. The Supreme Court of this state said in an action involving the legality of the 1909 issues (State ex rel. Tyrr«ll vs. Lincoln Traction Co,, 90 Neb. 535). "Nor will the valuation by implication fixed by the promoters of the consolidation concerning the value of the property of the constituent corporation and their stock and bonds bind the Rail - way Commission in determining in a proper case the investment upon which the respondent's stockholders' should receive a return in the way of dividends, or the exact amount of the charges that may be exacted for transporting passengers;" citing Smyth vs. Ames, supra, and other decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court. I can see no essential difference between the valuation of the prop- erty by the company in 1909 and the valuation by the Commission in authorizing securities heretofore. The court said that the former wab by implication only, and did not bind the Commission in a rate pro - ceeding; and the latter is no more than an implication- lacking in evi - dence and finding to make it of any effect. The Commission heretofore has always treated security authorizations in this manner. In the matter </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 299 of tbo applicafion of the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Co., for authority to issue $3,100,000 of bonds and stocks (Sixth Annual Report, p. 255), the Commission quoted the following excerpt from an opinion of the New Hampshire Commission with approval: "Ina-i'much as the approval of a proposed issue of securities for any purpose does not involve a determination that the property of the corporation making such issue devoted to public uses is fairly worth the total amount of its securities outstanding, it follows that such approval cannot at any time be urged as a reason for allowing the corporation to charge rates sufficient to enable it to pay divi - dends at any given rate on such securities. "Whenever the Commission is called upon to exercise its rate - making powers it must be governed by the fair value of the property devoted to public uses in the performance of the service for which a rate is to be fixed. In determining such fair value the amount of stock and bonds outstanding, if entitled to consideration at all, is entitled to very slight consideration, and the question whether the issuance of such stock and bonds or any part of the same has been with the approval of any regulatory Commission, cannot be entitled to any weight at all, because it will not be relevant to the question of the fair value of the property involved." and followed it with these words of its own: "In other words, the rule of caveat emptor applies to an investor purchasing the securities, the is'suannce of which is regulative by a commission. So far as we are advised, this rule is applied by all commissions administering similar laws." The majority give no reason for changing this construction of the law, and there is no good reason for it, as heretofore shown. APPLICATION NO. 3076 In the matter of the application of the North American Hotel Company of Council Bluffs, Iowa, for permit to sell securities in Nebraska. OUDKR By the Commission: The application of the North American Hotel Company, a corpora - tion of Council Bluffs, Iowa, with its principal offices at Omaha, Ne - braska, for permit to sell 1500,000 additional preferred stock, was' for - mally submitted to this Commission on the 21st day of June, 1918, after representatives of the Commission had spent much time upon the in - vestigation of the applicant company, its books, properties and affairs, after testimony had been taken on several different days, at which times the applicant company was always represented by counsel and generally, also, by officers or employes, and after applicant company had been given opportunity to introduce its evidence and had fully introduced its evidence both oral and documentary, and after the Commission had listened to extended arguments of counsel, and upon careful and due con sideration of all of the above, and being fully advised and informed in the premises, the Commission finds as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p298">300 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT On April 23, 1917, an order wai&gt;' entered and permit, valid for one year, was issued to the applicant company permitting it to sell its pre - ferred stock in the amount of 900,000 par value, and thereafter the present application was made for permit to sell $500,000 additional pre - ferred stock. The order dated April 23, 1917, provided that the appli - cant could not sell its preferred stock in an amount in excess of eighty per cent of the fair value of its physical property over and above the mortgage indebtedness thereon, and by the terms of the order violation of any of its conditions, rendered the permit, entered in pursuance of the order, null and void. In utter disregard of the terms of the order, the applicant sold stock largely in excess of eighty per cent of the fair value of its physical properties over and above the mortgage indebtedness thereon. A company guilty of violating the plain terms of an order granting permit to sell stock is' not in a position to come before the Commission for permit to sell a further issue. Connected with this subject, but not constituting a technical violation, although a violation of the spirit of the order of the Commission above referred to, was the sale of stock to the amount of $2,310,675.00. The order provided that the company had the privilege of selling stock to the amount of $900,000, and while there was no specific provision not to b'ell stock in other states, yet it was a palpable violation of the spirit of the order for the company to sell its full allowance in Nebraska, and then issue and sell stock in other states far in excess of the amount which had been allowed by the order While the applicant company's method of bookkeeping appears' on the surface to be fair and regular, yet in fact there are included under the heading of real estate and buildings, many items which mislead and deceive investors of the company, and cause them to think that the company has assets greatly in excess of its actual holdings; such method is fraudulent and for that reason the company can not be permitted to issue further stock. As an example of the improper method of bookkeeping, the Grand Island hotel property may be cited: The applicant company made a showing as of December 31, 1917, in which the Grand Island property was carried among the assets of the company at $406,059.81. The ground cost $39,628.95 and the building, though less than half completed, was carried on the books of the company at $366,400.86. The contract price on the building was $322,500.00, but as' soon as the contract was let, architects' fees to the amount of $16,125.00 were credited to the account of the building as well as commissions on stock sales amounting to $27,805.86. It may be contended that this is simply a matter of book - keeping, that the entire contract price is credited to the hotel property, and a charge equal in amount is made on the other side of the ledger. The architect's fees are put in at far more than the services are actually worth. The commissions amounting to $27,805.86 on sales of stock do not enter into the value of the physical property. It doubtless is a proper item in making up the assets of the corporation generally, but </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 the commissions paid on the sales of stoek in a corporation can not In credited to any particular building, because, the stock is issued on tin entire assets of the company. The inclusion of such Item is highly mis leading and fraudulent to prospective purchasers of stock, and can noi be sanctioned by the Commission. All of the stock of the applicant company, except $2oo.O oru mon stock, which holds all of the voting power, is six per cent cumulative preferred stock. If the plan of the organization of the company and methods of doing business render it impossible to pay six per cent upon its stock, then the sale of stock providing for such dividend rate is fradulent upon the investing public. The certificate of stock provides: "Before dividends shall be declared or paid on the common stock of this company, the holder of record of this certificate is entitled to receive and this company is bound to pay from its net earnings, a fixed yearly dividend of six per cent per annum, payable semi-annual - ly on the first days of January and July of each year. Such dividend shall be cumulative. After the six per cent dividends' on preferred and common stock have been paid, this certificate shall participate pro-ratio in fifty per cent of the net earnings' of the company." It is the plan of the applicant company, as outlined in its testimony, to build hotels in a number of towns in Nebraska, and adjacent states, some fourteen properties have already been planned for and it is also intended, by the officers of the company, to lease and operate a number of other hotels. Only two of the hotels are in actual operation at present. These are the Hartington hotel at Hartington, Nebraska, and the Black - stone hotel at Omaha, Nebraska. The Hartington hotel has been in operation something over a year, and the Blackstone hotel has been in operation something over a year and a half. The Hartington hotel with its furniture and fixtures is carried on the books of the company at over |100,000. Although the officers of the company insist that their manage - ment is highly efficient, that they employ only the most capable man - agers, and that by their superior methods the cost of hotel operation is far less than ordinarily incurred, yet the net result of the operation of the Hartington hotel up to this time has been a loss of $1,238.30. This is simply the excess of expenditures' over the receipts, as shown by the books of the company, and does not take into account repairs, replace - ments or depreciation. There was no income with which to pay dividends on the outstanding stock at the last dividend pay day, which was January 1, 1918. At that time the Bankers Realty Investment Company, which is a corporation, made what the applicant chooses to call a donation in the sum of $20,000. The Bankers Realty Investment Company being a corporation, could not give away its assets, so that while this amount was distributed to the stockholders of the North American Hotel Company, it was simply a subterfuge, and the latter company will undoubtedly be called upon to return the money to the treasury of the Bankers Realty Investment Com - pany. It was not only a fraud upon the Bankers 1 Realty Investment Com - pany, but it was also a fraud upon the stockholders of the North Amer- </seg>
            <seg id="p300">302 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT it-Hii Hotel Company, because under the statute of Nebraska, dividends could not be paid except from the earnings of the company, and was also a violation of the provisions of the certificate of stock itself. It is impossible to keep separate the three companies, the Bank - ers Realty Investment Company, the Blackstone Holding Company, and the North American Hotel Company. They appear in the records as thoroughly interlocked. In July. 1917, the Bankers Realty Investment Company, then the owner and holder of certain mortgages upon the Blackstone hotel in Omaha, Nebraska, issued a circular in which it placed the value of the property at $845,826.18. On December 19, 1917, the North American Hotel Company purchased from the Blackstone Holding Company the Blackstone hotel at the agreed price of $997,960.65. This was done without having any investigation made, or without con - sulting experts or engineers. As far as it appears from the evidence, it was at least $150,000 more than the property was then worth. It had been run at a loss ever since the date of its opening which was in No - vember, 1916. and it has since continued to run at a loss. Prom the time the North American Hotel Company took it over, until June, 1918, a period of six months, the receipts exceeded the expeditures by only $2,926.62 according to the books of the company, and for the month or May, the expenditures exceeded the receipts' by more than $4,000. This was without considering repairs, depreciation or retirements. With these items subtracted, it is seen that there is a net loss in the actual operation of the hotel, and that there is no chance for any return whatever to the stockholder; this occurred notwithstanding the showing by applicant that its management was efficient and that the hotel was running well toward capacity. Any further sale of stock under the statements male in the certificate concerning payment of dividends, would be a fraud upon the purchaser of stock and can not be sanctioned by this Commission. The purchase of the property for nearly a million dollars without any investigation whatever Is itself a suspicious circumstance, but coupled with the fact that the price was more than $150,000 more than those most interested in the hotel claimed a short time before (and as a matter of fact the evidence was' that the $845,826.18 was an exaggerated value), the purchase by the applicant company at the price above stated, was a fraud upon the stockholders of that company. Any issue of stock subsequent to the taking over of the Blackstone hotel would be burdened with the proportionate share of the loss incurred in the purchase of that property, and would be affected by the fraudulent character of that transaction. The business and affairs' of the North American Hotel Company and the Bankers Realty Investment Company are so closely associated and interwoven as to be incapable of exact and true separation. The latter corporation through its own and its president's holdings in the former company, has the actual control of the hotel company, and determines its actions' and policy. All of the hotels of the North American Hotel Company are built, under contract, by the Bankers Realty Investment </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION- 303 Company. The architect of the Bankers Realty Investment Company draws the plans for the hotels, and then although the form of com petitive bidding is gone through, there is in fact no bidder except tin- Bankers Realty Investment Company. I'nder the terms of the contract, then entered into, the architect of the bankers Realty Investment Com pany passes upon all differences between it and the North America!. Hotel Company, and the latter is' bound to accept, without question, tin - decision of the architect of the former company. Under such conditions, competition is utterly impossible, as no responsible contractor would agree to be bound by the word of his competitor's architect. The Bankers Realty Investment Company holds, contrary to the law of Nebraska, $70,000 of the common stock of the hotel company, and the president of the Bankers Realty Investment Company holds,' $100,000 thereof. The total common stock of the hotel company, which has the entire voting power, is only $200,000 so that the Bankers Realty Invest - ment Company really controls every action of the hotel company. It formulates the plans for its buildings, provides the architect, makes its specifications, its architect passes upon the work, and it controls all ot the mortgages placed upon the various properties. Not only is the busi - ness thus' blended, but the accounts of both companies are kept under the direction and control of the same auditor. In addition to the losses accruing from the operation of the Harting ton hotel and the Blackstone hotel, the company has.' had very heavy over head expenses. The record *hows that it pays $400 per month office rent, the president receives $3,600 per year and his living at the Black stone hotel, the vice president receives $500 per year, the secretary $5,000 per year and the treasurer $2,400 per year. In addition to all these expenses, there is a large office force, the exact cost of its main - tenance not being in evidence, but the expense must, judging from the other expenses', be very heavy. As there are no earnings from the prop - erties of the company, those in operation being run at actual loss, it is apparent that the overhead expenses must come from the money received from the sale of stock. These expenses are so heavy that their payment from the treasury of the company becomes a fraud upon its stockholders and is an additional reason why the application should be denied. Although the applicant has other hotels in process of construction, and is asking to sell $500,000 of its preferred stock to obtain funds there - for, when as shown by the findings above it is in no condition to care for the interests of the present stockholders, and to meet its promises as to dividends, it would be a distinct fraud upon the purchasing public to permit further sale of stock, the Commission therefore finds that the permit should be denied and application dismissed IT IS THEREFORE ORDER D by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the application of the North American Hotel Company, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, with its principal office at Omaha, Nebraska, for </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3097 In re Adams, American, and Welle Fargo A Company, Express Companies for Author - ity to put into effect on Intrastate busi - ness the same rates, rules, regulations and practices that are now in effect on Inter - state traffic. American Railway Express Company, As - signee. FINDING AND ORDER By the Commission Thebte proceedings were begun by an application filed with the Com - mission April 27, 1917, on behalf of the Adams, American, and Wells Fargo &amp; Company, express companies; the petition being in general s form as follows, to-wit: PETITION I "After a very thorough and exhaustive investigation by the Inter - state Commerce Commission of the express business of the country, that Commission prescribed a uniform system of rates, rules, regula - tions, and practices, effective February 1, 1914; when the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission was served upon the express companies, they, in the interest of uniformity, requested the various State Commissions to authorize the putting Into effect of the rates, rules, regulations, and practiced 1 prescribed by the Interstate Com - merce Commission for interstate business, on state business in the various states. Forty-two states have adopted for state business the rates, rules, regulations, and practices prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Since that time, however, eertain modifica - tions have been made by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the rates' prescribed by it, particularly in allowing a slightly higher package charge." II. "The petitioners respectfully state to the Commission that the rates on intra-state business now in effect in the State of Nebraska are unduly low and non-remunerative; and do not give to the petition - ers a fair charge for the service rendered by them to the public in the transaction of express business, to which petitioners believe they are entitled." Ill "The petitioners respectfully state to the Commission that the rates now in effect on intra-state business in the State of Nebraska are so low as not to produce sufficient revenue to pay the expense </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 305 of conducting such intra-state business, and are therefore conflscatory and in violation of both the constitutions of the State of Nebraska and the United States." IV "The petitioners respectfully state to the Commission that the rates, rules, regulations', and practices in effect in Nebraska on intra - state business at this time are not only unjustly discriminatory and unduly prejudicial as between points in Nebraska, but are unjustly discriminatory as against interstate business' to and from points In Nebraska, and unduly prejudicial in favor of Nebraska shippers as against interstate shippers to and from points' in Nebraska; and that therefore said rates, rules, regulations, and practices constitute a burden upon and a regulation of interestate commerce." V. "WHEREFORE, the petitioners respectfully request that they be allowed to put into effect on intrastate business the same rates, rules, regulations, and practices that are now in effect between points in Nebraska and other states, and that their request be set down for a hearing at as early a date as practicable." ADAMS EXPRESS COMPANY, AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, WELLS FARGO &amp; COMPANY, By, (Signed) Branch P. Kerfoot, (Signed) J. B. Harrison, Their Attorneys. New York, April 24, 1917. STATEMENT A short time after the above application was tiled, the Commission siet the same down for hearing on June 25, 1917, at 10 a. m. at which time representatives of the petitioners appeared before the Commission and asked to have a conference, with the end in view of finding out, as near as may be, what line of testimony and showing the Commission would consider as important and necessary for the express companies to make in support of their petition. More particularly, inquiry was made as to the period the companies should use in making their showing of the operating conditions under which the Nebraska intrastate express busi - ness was handled. As a result of said conference the express companies' agreed to read all of the way bills, and make deductions from all of the business handled within the State of Nebraska for the months of April and May, 1917, and were to submit detailed information of business han - dled by their agents', messengers, officers and other employes engaged in handling said applicant's business in the State of Nebraska for the months of September and October, which would be In all four months of the year 1917. Adjournment was then taken for the purpose of allowing the express companies to prepare their statistical data and any other showing they desired to make in support of their petition. On July 17, 1917, the Commission assigned for further hearing the petition herein considered for September 27 at 10 a. m. On September 17, 1917, in order to suit the convenience of the Commission, the hearing on this application was postponed to November 5, 1917, at which time, and for several days thereafter, namely November &amp;th, 8th, 7th 8th and </seg>
            <seg id="p304">306 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 9th the express companies and those interested in express shipments in th« State of Nebraska, appeared before the Commission. Testimony and supporting exhibits were introduced by the applicants, and by interested shippers. A continuance was then taken on motion of the Commission to January 21, 1918, for the purpose of allowing the Commission's account - ing department to analyze and investigate the exhibits introduced by petitioners in support of their application. At that time it was under - stood that any exhibits or testimony desired to be introduced by the Commssion would be prepared and submitted to all interested parties ten days before the last above mentioned date. On December 27, 1917, the Commission on its own motion continued the hearing set for January 21 to February 18, 1918. On January the 3rd. 1918, the Commission received telegraphic communication from the ap - plicants through their attorney as follows: "Owing to uncertain and disturbed transportation conditions I suggest that express rate case now pending before you be continued to a day to be fixed later. Please answer me at New York." The Commission thereupon on January 8 entered upon its docket the following, to-wit: "You are now advised again that the Commission has consid - ered your informal application and has postponed the hearing to an indefinite date to be fixed in the future. Notices have been sent to respondents and the Commission relies on you to notify applicants to that effect." On July 1, 1918, the companies interested in this application sola and transferred all of their property to a new corporation known as the American Railway Express Company. On July 9 said American Railway Express Company filed with this Commission through its traffic manager, Mr. Geo. S. Lee, its "withdrawal and adoption supplements" effective July 1, 1918. Said supplement reads in part as follows: "The American Railway Express Company adopts, ratifies and makes its own in every respect as if same had been filed by it, the tariffs to which this is a supplement . "All subsequent supplements or reissues will be issued and filed by Geo. S. Lee, traffic manager, American Railway Express' Com - pany." Under the Nebraska statutes the Commission finds that the American Railway Express Company occupies the same position in these proceed - ings as though the original application had been filed by said American Railway Express Company, and that the conferences, hearings and in - vestigations mentioned herein were had thereunder. Early in July, 1918, this Commission was requested by the United States Railroad Administration through said administration's associate director, Mr. Charles A. Prouty, to meet with a representative of the Railroad Administration, in person — Mr. Luther Walter — for the purpose of considering the advisability of an early disposition of the express companies' application, and the possibility of establishing Nebraska intra - state rates on the same general plan as adopted by the Interstate Com' </seg>
            <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 307 merce Commission for naming interstate express rales in the United States. Conference was held with Mr. Walter in St. Paul, August 11, 1918, in connection with State Commissioners from the states of Iowa and South Dakota. At the suggestion of Mr. Walter a further conference was held by the State Commissioners of the states named, with Director Prouty in Washington on August 23, 1918. On September 5th and 6th, the Commissioners' and representatives from the State Commissions of Iowa, South Dakota and Nebraska met in conference in St. Paul for the purpose of considering the suggestion of the Railroad Administration that said states adopt the interstate methods of naming express rates on intrastate traffic. On October 8, 1918, the Commissioners of the three states mentioned again met in conference in Omaha for the same purpose. On December 21 this Commission entered an alternative order in this case requiring the petitioners or petitioner, the American Railway Ex - press Company, to appear at the offices of the Commission at 10 a. m. December 30, 1918, and show cause, if any there be, why a final order should not be entered in this case establishing the schedule of first and second class scales of rates substantially in form and effect as provided in the order herein made and entered. On the date last mentioned no one appeared on behalf of the petitioner or petioners. All the testimony and exhibits introduced by the applicants and in - terested shippers in the several hearings heretofore mentioned, have been carefully considered by the Commission and constitute the record upon which the findings and order herein are based. The applicants sought to show that the present Nebraska intrastate express rates are not sufficient to pay operating expenses' and a reason - able return on the property and facilities used by the applicant in the transportation of the Nebraska intrastate traffic. In our findings and order herein made, the Commission takes into account the fact that since the hearing of November, 1917, there has been a material increase in the schedule of wages paid the salaried employes of the petitioners, and that there has been increased cost of labor and material to the railroad company in whose cars and upon whose tracks, the express busi - ness of the applicants is transacted in the State of Nebraska In our findings and order in this' case we do not approve trie methods adopted by applicants in their division of operating expenses between interstate, transstate and intrastate traffic. Neither do we directly pass upon the reasonableness nor propriety of the plan adopted by the appli - cants In their payments to the railroad companies for the services ren - dered in transporting the express business within the State of Nebraska, At the November hearing applicants presented testimony intended to show that the interstate method of establishing express rates was fair and reasonable as applied to the Nebraska intrastate traffic. The testi - mony showed that in addition to the block system adopted by the Inter- State Commerce Commission the blocks within Nebraska were to be CONCLUSIONS </seg>
            <seg id="p306">308 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT further sub-divided, by establishing sub-blocks within each block. This plan of makine intrastate express rates is commonly known as the New York plan, and is one that has been adopted by practically all of the State Railroad Utility Commissions having charge ot express rates in the United States. The present method of naming intrastate express rates in the State of Nebraska has for its basis, straight mileage distances, applied to the line of railroad over which the s'everal express companies operate, who do business in Nebraska. The express charge for traffic handled between different express companies in Nebraska is on the sum of the local rates, based on common junction points as provided by the tariffs in effect January 1, 1917. The method or plan proposed by the applicants, in lieu of the present rate structure, contemplates the making of rates without regard to different express companies. The rates are to be fixed from each block or sub-block to every other block or sub-block, without regard to the line of railroad or express company over which the traffic will travel. In this particular many of the present interline rates would be reduced. 'We are of the opinion and so find that there is need of uniforrr t.. in the general plan of quoting interstate and intrastate express rates within Nebraska. It is our opinion, however, and we so find, that the application of the scales of rates as used by the Interstate Commerce Commission in zone three territory, and as requested by applicants it paragraph five of the petition, is excessive and exorbitant for the trans portation of Nebraska intrastate traffic. We also find that the Nebraska classification number 17 and gradu - ated scale of pound rates now in effect on Nebraska intrastate traffic, is inadequate and not well adapted to the packing, handling, and transpor - tation of the intrastate express business; that the Official Express Classi - fication No. 2 promulgated by the applicants herein and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission is fair and just for the transportation of Nebraska intrastate express traffic. The blocks as established by the Interstate Commerce Commission conform to the meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude as they appear in the State of Nebraska. Towns located on or very close to said meridians' or parallels are specifically allocated to a given block. All of the stations in the State of Nebraska found to be located in certain blocks by the Interstate Commerce Commission is substantially the same as adopted by this Commission as fair and reasonable for the Nebraska intrastate express traffic. The Commission also finds that the sub-divid - ing of the blocks into sixteen sub-blocks lettered from "A" to "Q" both included, are fair and reasonable when applied to Nebraska intrastate business. The Interstate Commerce Commission's plan of establishing inter - state express rates' as requested by the applicants herein, proposes that for each sub-block which represents in miles approximately twelve and one-half miles east and west, and fourteen miles north and south, shall be </seg>
            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 309 graduated on a five-cent increase added to the base rate for each one hundred pounds and for each sub-block from one to four. It is then proposed by applicant that the next rate beyond the fourth s'ubblock shall be found by the application of scale No. 8, which has the effect of making a twenty-five cent increase in the charges per hundred pounds between stations located in the fifth sub-block as compared with those stations located in the fourth sub-block from any given point of origin located in the so-called "home" sub-block. It is our opinion that twenty - five cents ifc! too great a spread in the rates for bo short a haul. The schedule of class scales promulgated by the express companies or company and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission as provided in the American Railway Express Company's Local and Joint Tariff of first and second class express rates No. 3, are found by this Commission to be just and reasonable for the purpose of naming express rates between stations located wholly within the State of Nebraska. It is the opinion of the Commission and we so find, that just and reasonable intrastate express rates will be more equally established if the Commission adopts a schedule of rates that will not make such sud - den breaks for short distances between sub-blocks as described by us In the preceding paragraph. The Commission further finds that if a five-cent increas'e in rates were established between sub-blocks for the distance of eight sub-blocks, or, In round figures, one hundred miles, and a graduated scale of ten cents for each twenty-five miles or two sub-blocks beyond the eighth sub-block, would be more reasonable and just than the plan proposed by the applicants in these proceedings. A schedule of scales as,' here pro - posed has been prepared by the Commission and the same is found to be just and reasonable for the transportation of the Nebraska intras'tate ex - press business. In the order, a schedule of scales for the finding of the rates and charges herein found reasonable, will be set out in detail. At the hearing applicants proposed that the Nebraska Commi&amp;feion accept the same plan as proposed by the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion for the transportation of first and second class matter on Nebraska intrastate traffic, viz: second class rates, 1 should be 75% of first class rates. This portion of applicant's petition is found to be just and reasonable and is approved for the purpose of disposing of this case. At the November hearing, applicants proposed a further modification of the suggested second class scale of rates, by allowing special com - modity rates upon certain food stuffs handled extensively in Nebraska intrastate traffic. After consideration of all of the testimony and facts of record, the Commission is of the opinion and so find that the following commodities shall be handled by the applicant comanies or company under the special commodity tariff which will be set out In detail in the order entered in this case. The commodities entitled to be transported on said commodity rates are as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p308">310 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT Fruit, green — fresh Bakery good Berries. Butter Calves, dressed Cheese. Meats, all kinds Oysters, clam or scalloped. Poultry. Drink, articles of. Eggs, for market. Fish, except alive Food, articles of. Pigeons, dressed or alive Vegetables, green. The scale of rates hereinafter entered and made a part of this find - ing and order, entitled "Commodity Scale of Rates," will apply for the transportation of the commodities mentioned above, offered for shipment in packages as provided in Official Classification No. 26. The scale of commodity rates here found reasonable shall be applied on a pound basis with a minimum charge of 30 cents for a single shipment. Nothing in this report or order shall be construed so as to in any manner affect, alter, or change the existing transportation charges for shipments of milk and cream in Nebraska intrastate traffic. At some future date the Nebraska Commission proposes, of its own motion, to take up and investigate the reasonableness of the present plan adopted and used by the express' company or companies operating in the State of Nebraska, for the payment of services rendered by the railroad companies to the express companies for the transportation of intrastate express traffic, at which time all interested parties will be given a chance to appear and show cause, why the present plan should or should not be supplemented by some plan other than the present revenue basis. On November 19, 1918, Mr. W. G. McAdoo, director general of the railroads of the United States, directed the American Railway Express Company to file with the Interstate Commerce Commission, schedule of rates applying on Nebraska intrastate traffic. On December 15, 1918, said American Railway Express Company did file with the Interstate Commerce Commission, as directed by said director general, express rates, rules and regulations, effective January 1, 1919, intended to apply for the transportation of Nebraska intrastate express traffic. In view of this attempt on the part of the American Railway Express Company and Director General of Railroads, to unlawfully regulate and establish intrastate express ratea' for Nebraska traffic, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that an emergency exists and that the order herein entered by this Commission shall take effect at midnight on December 30, 1918. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings ORDER This case being at is.vue on application and having been duly heard and submitted by all parties, and no cause being shown why the rates and classification set forth in the Commission's order, dated December 21, 1918, should not be adopted, and the Commission having, on the date </seg>

            <seg id="p362">364 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION NO. 3363. In the Matter of the Application of Home Securities Company, of Sioux City. Iowa, to Sell $200,000 of its Preferred Stock in Nebraska. FINDING AND ORDER HALL, Commissioner: This matter came on (or hearing on the 11th day of February, 191S, upon the supplementary application of said company, which company was represented by its president, P. H. Pilchard, and its attorneys, H. S. Lower, of Lincoln, and D. P. Shull, of Sioux City, Iowa. Mr. Pilchard was sworn and testified at length. Upon consideration of said testi - mony, the exhibits and files, and examination made of said company at Sioux City, Iowa, the Commission finds as follows: Finds that said company is organized under the laws of Iowa with an authorized capitalization of $1,000,000, of which $150,000 is to be com - mon stock and $850,000 preferred, non-voting, cumulative 7 per cent stock. The applicant proposes to use the proceeds of said capitalization in making real estate mortgage loans and loans upon cattle, which is a perfectly legitimate business. The company has been putting out certain advertising which tends to overestimate the business and might result in deceiving prospective purchasers of stock. The company is willing, however, to withdraw such objectionable advertising. The Commission also finds that under the Iowa statutes there is no provision for regular or systematic examination of such corporations, and the organization is represented as such as is exempt from the operation of the Iowa Blue Sky law. If this is true, there is a chance for the company to handle a million dollars of assets without systematic state supervision and inspection. The Commission further finds that if the $150,000 of common- stock were fully paid the equity in the assets of the company would be but 15 per cent above the $850,000 of preferred stock. The Commission has adopted a rule that at least 20 per cent of actual assets must be in properties over and above the amount of preferred stock outstanding. This rule was adopted for the one purpose of protecting the preferred stock. The organizers of the company, however, have subscribed for $80, - 000 of the $150,000 of common stock, which gives them the control through the voting power of the company. In other words $80,000 is 53 1-3 per cent of the $150,000 . The $150,000 is 15 per cent of the $1,000, - 000 capitalization, therefore 53 1-3 per cent of 15 per cent of the whole capitalization controls the entire company. The stockholders who have subscribed for the $80,000 of common stock by reason of their subscrip - tion to said stock hold the balance of power in their hands, yet they have in fact paid in to the treasury of the company but $11,000. We </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 365 then find that $11,000, or a little over 1 per cent of the entire capitaliza - tion, wtll control the entire operation of the million dollar corporation. The Commission frowns upon such a system of financing. It should not commend itself to anyone of good business standing. If the organizers of the company wish to sell any portion of the $850,000 of preferred stock in the state of Nebraska it will be necessary for them to make a satis - factory showing to the Commission that they have out of proceeds from common stock invested at least 20 per cent as an equity in tangible as - sets of the company over and above the $850,000. Another objectionable feature to their organization is that they represent to the public that the stock shall carry 7 per cent guaranteed dividends and that the company has the privilege of redeeming said preferred stock within three years provided they pay par value together with accumulated dividends back to the holders of said stock. But, as a matter of fact, the company has entered into a contract with a fiscal agency by which the fiscal agency sells the stock at $125 00, the fiscal agency keeping $25.00 as its commis - sion. The purchaser of the stock must pay $30.00 on each share, before the $25.00 is paid to the fiscal agency, leaving an unpaid balance of $95.00 per share. When this is paid we find that 20 per cent of the pur - chaser's money has gone to the fiscal agency and 80 per cent has gone into the treasury of the company. If the company should elect to re - deem the preferred stock immediately after the sales were made, ac - cording to the articles of incorporation all it would have to do would be to pay back the par value, which would be $100 per share and the ac - cumulated dividends. If there were no accumulated dividends to start with, the purchaser of the stock would immediately lose his $25.00. The Commission cannot endorse such a scheme, nor will the Commission authorize the sale of stock, in Nebraska, or a corporation the articles of incorporation of which prohibit the purchaser of that stock from having a voice in the management of the affairs of the company. It would be contrary to the constitution of the state of Nebraska, and be - cause it is permitted in Iowa affords no reason for the Nebraska State Railway Commission to recognize it in the state of Nebraska. The Commission is, therefore, of the opinion that the application should not be. granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the application of the Home Securities company, a corpora - tion of Sioux City, Iowa, to sell $200,000 of its 7 per cent non-voting, cumulative preferred stock be and the same is hereby denied and the application dismissed.

            <seg id="p364">366 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT In the Matter of the Application of the Eagle Telephone Company for Author - ity to Increase its Exchange Rates. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner. The Eagle Telephone company, applicant herein, was organized in the fall of 1901 by the citizens of that town subscribing for and taking twenty-two shares of stock at $15.00 a share, amounting to $330.00, said money to be used in building a telephone exchange in Eagle. The com - pany started with seven telephones. During the next few years four grou. o of farmers organized farm lines and ran them into the switch - board of the Eagle Telephone company. All phone users paid fifty cents per month. From 1901 to J903 the number of subscribers' stations had increased to one hundred thirty. The four farm lines and the Eagle ex - change in 1909 consolidated their properties. The farm lines have been organized on the basis of $15.00 per share, the same as that of the Eagle company. When the combination was made everybody was assessed $5.00 per share, which amounted to $10.00 per subscriber's station 5e - cause there was a $5.00 assessment on the telephone and $5.00 on the line. The combined company then toot up all of the stock of both com - panies and issued new stock at $20.00 per share. This amounted to $4,780, which was increased $80.00 by the sale of stock, making the entire oustanding capitalization $4,860. Since that time no stock has been sold nor have any assessments been made upon the stockholders for operat - ing expen:,es or extensions and betterments. All telephone users, both stockholders and non-stockholders, were then charged $1.00 per month for all classes of service, which rate has been continuously and is now in effect. The applicant now asks that said rates be increased to $2.00 per month for de"k telephones, $1.50 per month for business telephones, $1.50 per month for one-party residence telephones, $1.50 for two-party - residence telephones, and $1.25 for farm telephones, the number on farm lines to be limited to ten. The company paid no dividends for the y?ars 1909 and 1910. but in lieu thereof expended the net balances, after all operating expenses, taxes, losses and damages were paid, in certain ex - tensions and betieiments, the exact amount of which the company could not give the Commission. They did state, however, that the extensions and betterments built out of the operating income for those years con sisted of a switchboard, which cost $207.00; that they installed a certain amount of cable but did not know the cost of it; that they built a coal house in the lots, and a pole rack, and that they also pu, in a well, all of which were paid for out of the operating income. From January, 1912, to January, 1918, inclusive, the company de - clared and paid out in cash the following amounts as dividends upon the $4,860: APPLICATION NO. -T414 </seg>

The president and secretary of the company both admitted that they realized that excessive dividends were being paid and that the properties were allowed to depreciate on that account but the board of directors insisted on the dividends as above shown. The engineering department of the Commission after examination reported the properties to be in not more than 46 r ; condition. The statement of the officers and the report of the engineering department in regard to the depreciation of the properties conclusive - ly show that the properties were constantly beins robbed by the directors by paying out money as dividends that should have been spent for main - tenance and depreciation. The Commission is of the opinion that the directors should not have paid out any dividends if money had not been earned sufficient to maintain the properties, and certainly the company should restore to its treasury dividends received in excess of a normal amount that the properties may be rehabilitated, but as it may be diffi - cult to collect the excessive dividends paid to the individual stockholders the Commission is of the opinion that the stockholders should forego dividends until it amounts to $1,468 at 7', upon the outstanding capital Total $4 Average percent in dividends 13 2-7 per cent. 911 912 913 914 915 .916 917 $607.50 729.00 739.00 729.00 607.50 729.00 388.80 </seg>

It now owns and operates electric light and power plants located in the cities of Norfolk, Battle Creek, Meadow Grove and Tilden, and now proposes to construct a transmission line connecting the cities of Hooper and Scribner, for the present at least generating the current at Hooper. The company now applies for authority to construct a three-phase electric transmis - sion line of 33,000 volts. The line is to be built of entirely new ma - terial and according to specifications set forth in its application, supple - mented by the requirements of this Commission. The proposed transmission line parallels for a distance of three miles a line of the Hooper Telephone company. It also crosses at frequent intervals lines of the same company. In addition It parallels lines of the Farmers Telephone company of Dodge county for a distance of ap - proximately two miles and a half. A map showing the proposed route, and indicating the lines of the telephone companies to be affected, ac - companies the application. An effort was made, through negotiations with these companies, to secure agreements covering the construction of the transmission line, as provided by statute. These negotiations were unsuccessful, however, and the matter was set down for hearing. At this hearing representatives of each of the companies were present. These representatives expressed the fear that the construction of a line carrying such high voltage would seriously interfere with the telephone service, particularly for the reason that extended parallels are involved.

Telegraph Company for Optional Metallic Rates at Utica, Nebraska. OPINION AND FINDING. By the Commission This applicant company has been the owner of the telephone system at Utica, Nebraska, since 1912. It found itself under the necessity within the last few months of doing considerable rebuilding and has made it practically an all-cable plant with new telephones throughout the ex - change limits of Utica. It has made application to the Commission for authority to publish optional metallic service rates covering a proposed new zone system, as follows: Per month Individual business, Utica zone $2.50 Individual residence, Utica zone 1.50 2-party residence Utica exchange only 1.25 The rates now in effect at Utica, part of which are the rates in - herited from the Seward County Telephone company, predecessor of Telephone company, predecessor of applicant, are as follows Applicant has proceeded with the rebuilding operations and at the same time has solicited subscribers to the zone system. The proposed zone system includes the Utica exchange, the Tamora exchange, farm lines connected to the Beaver Crossing exchange and lying north of Beaver Crossing, and farm lines connected to the Waco exchange and lying east of Waco. Applicant represents that a large ma - jority of the patrons have subscribed for this extended service. The Utica exchange was built by the Seward County Telephone com - pany, which company had an extensive system in Seward county. All the property of the Seward County Telephone company was purchased by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, present applicant, on June 30, 1912, the consideration being face value of the actual investment, as follows: Individual business $18.00 per annum net 2-party business 18.00 per annum net 4-party business 18.00 per annum net Individual residence 12.00 per annum net 2-party residence 12.00 per annum net 4-party residence 12.00 per annum net Farm residence 12.00 per annum net Farm business 18.00 per annum net Optional farm line rate, metallic, 10 parties or less, with free connection to one ad- ditional adjoining exchange to be chosen by lines 18.00 per annum net </seg>
            <seg id="p370">372 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT nues on the new rates and new zone system, do not promise any con - siderable return on the investment which undoubtedly exists. This showing for 1917 was as follows: Applicant has not attempted to prove in the reproduction new figures of $26,404.57, on which depreciation is figured in the above tabu - lations, nor the present worth of $22,123.66 on which a return is figured, but if no return at all is allowed on the investment, the financial show - ing for 1917 still leaves a deficit of $125.37. Applicant estimates the increase in revenues due to the new zone rates $70 a month, and if this estimate is correct, the deficit would be turned into a surplus of $715. This would be a reasonable return on a valuation of $10,200 only, pro - vided the depreciation in the tabulation above has been figured on a proper valuation. The Commission cannot, because of a lack of evidence, place any valuation on the present plant at the time rebuilding operations began, nor is there any evidence as to the amount of money being spent in the rebuilding of this plant, but it is of the opinion that a valuation is not necessary at this time in order to protect rate payers. No adequate history of the Seward County Telephone company is in the hands of the Commission for the period 1903, when organization was effected, to the year 1908. From the year 1908 to the time applicant company purchased all the property of the Seward County Telephone company, the financial history is in the hands of the' present owner, and a summary has been Capital stock $100,000.00 Six per cent, bonds 5,000.00 Bills payable assumed 20,100.00 Accounts payable assumed 801.16 Total cost »125,»01.16 This case was not set down for hearing because the financial show ing for 1917 of the Utica exchange, plus an estimated increase in reve Rental revenue 25% of tolls collected Miscellaneous .$5,135.80 ... 501.81 37.05 Total Less license revenue .$5,674.66 ... 140.86 Net total exchange revenue ..$5,533.80 EXPENSES Operating expense Current repairs Depreciation (6% on $26,404.57) Interest (8% on $22,123.66) $2,909.52 ... 1,155.38 ... 1,584.27 ... 1,769.82 Total expenses TV»fir&gt;tt for 1917 ..$7,418.99 1 KRS 19 $7,418.9 1,885.1 </seg>

This shows that dividends were paid in 1908 and 1909 of twelve per cent, per annum; in 1910, ten per cent; in 1911 and 1912, eight per cent. Nor does the Commission have any ade - quate Information concerning the investment by stockholders in the Seward County Telephone company, or in that portion known as the Utica exchange. The Commission is, therefore, unable to determine what allowance should be made for a return upon the investment, and until the company furnishes fhe Commission with a proper basis therefor, it will be prohibited from distributing any portion of the revenues derived from the Utica plant in excess of the current expenses, maintenance, taxes, losses and damages, and it will be required to hold all surplus revenue in trust subject to further orders of the Commission.

OPINION AND FINDING By The Commission The applicant herein is a foreign corporation, which has complied with the laws of the state of Nebraska, and is engaged in the generation and sale of electric power to the public. It asks permission to build a new transmission line from a point near Yutan to Meid. with certain branch lines, all in Saunders county, to carry alternating electric current at a pressure of 6600 volts to be operated eventually at a pressure of 16,500 volts. A map, showing the proposed routing, and specifications which de - scribe the manner of construction of the proposed main line and branches, have been filed with the application as provided by law. The location of the transmission lines to be erected by the applicant is as follows: Beginning at the center of the east side of Sec. 27, T-15-N, R-9-E, a three-phase line will extend south on the west side of the road to the northeast corner of Sec. 34; thence west along the south side of the road north of Sections 34, 33, 32 and 31 in T-15-N, R-9-E; thence extending west on the south side of the road along the north side of Sec. 36 and a portion of Sec. 35 in T-15-N. R-8-E, to the intersection of a line of Elm St. in the town of Mead and the above mentioned section line; thence extending south on the east side of Elm St. to the south town limits of the town of Mead; thence extending east on the south side of the road to the east side of Sec. 35; thence ex - tending south on the west side of the road to the southeast corner of Sec. 35, T-15-N, R-8-E; thence extending south on the west side of the road east of Sec 2, T-14-N, R-18-E to the northeast corner of Sec. 11; thence extending west on the south side of the road north of Sec. 11, approximately one half mile. A three-phase branch is to be taken from the main line at the north - east corner of Sec. 31, T-15-N, R-9-E, and extended north on the west side of the road along the east side of Sec. 30 to the northeast corner of Sec. 30, from which point a single-phase branch is to be taken, which will extend east along the north side of the road south of Sec. 20 to the southwest corner of Sec. 21 ; thence north along the east side of the road west of Sec. 21, to the southwest corner of Sec. 16; also from the southwest corner of Sec. 21 extending east on the north side of the road aboul one-third mile along the south side of Sec. 21. A single-phase tap is also to be taken from this line about the center of Sec. 20 and extending south into Sec. 29, about one-fourth mile. Also at the northeast corner of Sec. 30 a single phase tap is to be taken from the three-phase line and extended west along the south side of the road north of Sec. 30, T-15-N, R-9-E, and along the north side of Sec. 25, T-15-N, R-8-E, to the northwest corner of Sec. 25.

A single-phase, two-wire tap is to be made from the three-wire line at the northeast corner of Sec. 32, T-15-N, R 9-E, and extended south approximately 1-3 mile along the west side of the road east of Sec. 32. Also a single-phase .two-wire tap is to he made from the three - phase line at the northwest corner of Sec. 54, T-15'-N, R-9-E, and extended south along the east side of the road west of Sec. 34, ap - proximately five-eighths of a mile. Also a single-phase, two-wire tap is to be taken off the three-phase line at the center of the north side of Sec. 34, T-15-N, R-9-E, and extended south along the west side of the road to the center of Sec. 34, a distance of approximately five - eighths of a mile. Also a single-phase, two-wire tap is to be taken fromthe three-phase line at the northeast corner of Sec. 35, T-15-N, R-8-E, and extended south along the west side of the road east of Sec. 35, a distance of approximately one half mile. Also a single - phase, two-wire tap is to be taken from the three-phase line at a point about one fourth mile south of the northeast corner of Sec. 2, T-14-N, R-8-E and extended east into Sec. 1, a distance of approxi - mately one fourth mile. The parties owning existing electric lines who will lie affected by this new construction, are the Union Pacific Railway company, the Western Union Telegraph company, and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph company. The applicant has filed agreements with the above parties at interest. The Commission finds that the applicant has complied with the law, and that the prayer of its petition should be granted. The Commission also finds that one year from the date of this order is a reasonable length of time in which to build the proposed lines. The Commission further finds that the voltage at which the lines will be operated for an indefinite period of time will not exceed a pressure of 6600 volts, and that this pressure or voltage shall not be exceeded, except as provided by statute.

Under the tariffs of the railroads operating in Omaha, the charges involved herein are absorbed, particularly where a road haul is involved. These carriers were all notified of the application and of the time and place of the hearing, but entered no formal appearance and took no part in any of the proceedings. Likewise, all of the industries involved were notified but only two, the Omaha Live Stock Exchange and N. B. Updike, entered protest and these two offered no testimony. This Commission has had under consideration twice before the rates here involved- -Application 38 and Application 144. In the latter order, issued Oct. 29, 1910. the present rates were approved. In these two cases, the history of applicant's business and the general character of the service were thoroughly considered, and we find it unnecessary to repeat the discussion of these matters here. The application for increases is baseu entirely on the showing that operating costs of every kind have materially advanced during the past few years, and on the further fact that the Interstate Commerce Com - mission, in a recent order, approved, for interstate traffic, the rates here - in proposed. The claim of advanced operating costs is supported by the record. It is shown conclusively that not only has the scale of wages been increased on an average of over twenty per cent, but, owing to the adoption of the eight hour day, the number of men actually employed has increased twenty-two per cent, notwithstanding there has been no material increase in business handled. The same number of engines are in use now as were in use in 1910. but the cost of operating them for the year 1917 was $58,695 greater than in 1910. The cost per mile increased from 42.14 cents in 1910 to 59.82 cents in 1917. The increase in cost of materials and supplies actually purchased and used in the switching department amounts to an average of seventy-five per cent. The increase in the size of cars handled and the tonnage carried amount - ed to over thirty-five per cent between February, 1917, and Febrjary, 1918- The increase in the tonnage is due quite largely to the demands of the government for heavier loading in the effort to effect greater efficiency of equipment. The effect of this heavier loading has been to decrease the per ton earnings of applicant on an average of twenty - two per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p377">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 379 It U shown that the rates proposed are no higher than the rates for similar service charged by railroads -md terminal carriers at Des Mones, Denver, Lincoln, Fremont, St. Paul, Chicago. Kansas City, St. Joseph, Council Bluffs. Davenport. Cedar Rapids. Ottumwa and Toledo. The general average at these points is higher than the rates proposed. In I. and S. Docket No. 806. Switching Charges at South Omaha, Ne - braska, the Interstate Commerce Commission on December 12, 1916, approved for interstate traffic the rates asked tor here. These rateis have been in effect since that time. The service performed by applicant for interstate and intrastate shippers is identical, and, so tar as we are advised, there can be no reason for different charges. As we said in Application 38: "The Commission is not advised of any reason, so lar as the charges of applicant are concerned, why any distinction or dis - crimination should be shown in favor of intrastate shipments as dis - tinguished from interstate shipments. On the contrary, it is the opinion of the Commission that, in arriving at a decision as to what is a just and equitable charge for the service performed, they should be treated alike." We are of the opinion and so find thai Ihe rates proposed are :eas onable and should be approved. It should be understood, however, that the rates are approved under the conditions as they exist at the pres ent time, and that when these conditions are restored to normal and costs of labor and material are reduced, the matter will be a proper oub- ject for investigation to determin what the rates should then b?&gt; As to who should bear the bun mission is of the same opinion as railroads, under the law, arc undei unloading live stock at South Om own facilities for this purpose, but facilities from applicant. In othei constitute a common terminal Coi - tions are maintained. Under the n len of the increased rates, the Corn - expressed in previous orders. The r obligation to provide facilities lor aha.

The Commission, therefore, finds that the increases herein authorized should be absorbed by the connecting carriers under the same rules and condi - tions as now apply to absorption under present rates. In view of the substantial increase of rates granted to the railroads bv the director general of railroads to become effective June 25. 1918. the requirenv nt as to absorptions cannot be held to be unreasonable.

This Commission for a number of years has been making a careful study of 'he relative merits of the near and far side stops by street car systems in many parts of the leading cities of tht United States. The Commission finds that the near side stop has gradu - ally come 10 be the standard; that but few well regulated cities are permitting the far side stops to be made to the exclusion of the near side stop. The far side slop throws the traffic on the streets into con - fusion, which leads directly to many accidents and great loss of life. The near side stop also does away with many duplicate stops. The Lincoln Traction company is at present making at out 13.000 emer - gency stops daily. A great per cent of the stops would be eliminated if the near side stop were established and in practice. The Commission is of the opinion that the near side stop will result in a raving of fuel in amount sufficient to challenge the attention of the Commission 'o it, but by far the greater element to be considered is the ranger occas ioned by the far side stop. The Commission recommends that the offi - cers of the Traction Company should require all passengers boarding double end cars to enter said car front end.

BROWNE, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3466 In the Matter of the Application of Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for Op - tional Service Rates at Sutton. Nebraska. OPINION AND FINDING WILSON, Commissioner, On January 1, 1917, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, hereinafter called the company, purchased a magneto telephone system at Sutton, Nebraska, at an alleged cost of $15,000, of which $4,200 repre - sented the exchange building and real estate. The system served ap - proximately six hundred subscribers to the company's exchange at Clay Center, the county seat of the county in which Sutton is located. The system was in a poor state of repair and the service very unsatisfactory. The rates in effect were as follows : : One-party business One-party residence Farm residence $1.50 per month . 1.00 per month . 1.00 per month Extension business Extension residence .75 per month additional .50 per month additional On February 18, 1918, the company represented to the Commission that it had about completed a reconstruction of the plant at an estimated cost of $20,780. Common battery service is being substituted within the city limits of Sutton and the farmers' lines placed in a good operating condition. The company now asks authority to add to the schedule of rates above described the following schedule to cover the new metallic service: One-party business, common battery. One-party residence, common battery $2.50 per month . 1-50 per month Two-party residence, common battery. 1.25 per month The application was not set down for hearing and was considered on the ex parte testimony of the company's representatives, for the rea - son that the new rates did not promise much return on the amount expended for reconstruction, to say nothing of a return on whatever ad- </seg>

The company estimates the replacement or reproduction new v.tlue of the plant to be $43,470, and, the expenses of operation and taxes will be in the neighborhood of $9.00 per station annually. The Commission cannot for want of testimony on the subject place any valuation upon the property, but a valuation is not necessary at this time in order to protect the rate-payers. The estimate as to operating costs is in line with the expense of other companies, and since it is subject to the Mmi - tation of actual expenditures, its acceptance likewise jeopardizes 1 no rights. The estimate of the plant's annual requirements for all pur - poses is as follows: Maintenance and depreciation, »&lt;&gt;; of $43,470 $3,912.30 Other expenditures, 604 stations at $9.00 each 5,436-00 Total $9,348.30 Gross earnings $10,142.60 ll Operating expenses and taxes $5 439.45 ' Deducting the foregoing estimate from the estimated revenues leaves wa- he sum of $768.80 in surplus revenues.

            <seg id="p384">386 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT expended in the reconstruction of thr plant. $20,780, is $1,454.60; and upon the purchase price of the plant. $15,000. is $1,050; or, to compute the return in another form, the estimated revenue available for iliat purpose, $768.80, will yield a return of 7% upon the amount of $10,983, only. It is manifest, therefore, that the new rates are not excessive or unreasonable and they will be approved subject to restriction as to the use which may be made of the revenues derived therefrom until I he further order of the Commission. The Commission's uniform allowance for maintenance and depreci - ation in telephone rate cases has been based upon the experiences of many telephone companies to the effect that the greater portion oi the allowance is required for reconstruction purposes. Repairs are com - paratively small in the beginning of new plants, but they increase con - stantly with age, and there comes ;i time when the old poles and other wooden fixtures, the switchboard, and even the wires, are no longer sus - ceptible of repair, and new material must be substituted. The com - parative costs of repairs and reconstiuction vary from one to two to four to five. The company in the instant case claims that the latter ratio is approximately correct. It is therefore apparent that the a°low - ance, in so far as it provides for reconstruction, should be conserved for the future and should not be expended for reconstruction already dine- The company made no showing as to the accumulation of the Kinds from the Sutton plant for reconstruction purposes. Revenues and ex - penses were shown for the year 1917 only which were as follows: Current maintenance $ 1,190.44 Total 6,629.89 Surplus revenues $ 3,512.71 The burden whs upon the company to show the investment in the plant of its predecessors, as well as its own, and the revenues and disbursements of the plant from the beginning, unless it was unable to do so through no neglect on its part. The Commission is therefore un - able to determine what allowance should be made for return upon the investment and until the company furnishes the Commission with a proper basis therefor as above indicated it will be prohibited from dis - tributing rny portion of the revenue derived from the Sutton plant in excess of the costs of operation, current maintenance, taxes, losses and damages: and it will be required to hold such surplus revenues In trust subject to the further orders of the Commission.

In the Matter of the Application of the Sioux City, Crystal Lake and Homer Railway Company for Authority to Discontinue Ser - vice on its Lines, and to Abandon und Re - move i; Properties Between South Sioux City and Dakota City. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner. The matter herein came on for hearing before Commissioner Hall in (he district court room at Dakota City, 9:30 a. m., March 28 1918. The appearances were as follows: For applicant, Ira Howard, vice pr3si - dent, and Geo. W. Learner, attorney. Mr. Learner alsc appeared as at - torney for Dakota county. For the city of South Sioux City. Ward R. Evans; for the city of Dakota City, S. T. Frum. The applicant herein, "The Sioux City, Crystal Lake and Homer Railway Company," asks authority of the Railway Commission to take up its t.ncks between South Sioux City and Dakota City, Nebraska, and also the track running to Crystal Lake, and trucks in South Sioux City and Dakota City. The lines now owned and operated by the applicant occupy certain streets In South Sioux City, a right of way on the west side of the public hgh - way known as "The Washington Automobile Highway," the right of way across certain private properties, and also a right of way extend - ing westward from the public highway referred to aa Crystal Lake, </seg>
            <seg id="p386">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 388 This right of way referred to last is on private property and is heM bj a contract running from year to year. The applicant also occupies cer - tain streets in Dakota City. When the company was originally incorporated, the intention was to extend the line to Homer, Nebraska- However, the line was only constructed as far south as Dakota City, making the present line in operation approximately 3.8 miles in length. The line became financially embarrassed and was sold to one J. A. Foy, who was the principal stock - holder in 1906, and it continued to operate under financial embarrass - ment until" what is known as the "Howard Family" became interested in the project. They purchased 494 shares out of 500 which were then out - standing for approximately $25,000. They put in approximately $15,000 in money, and borrowed $10,300, upon $4,800 of which they are paying 8 per cent interest, and upon $5,500, 10 per cent interest, interest being paid monthly. The Howard family has never received any dividends upon their investment, and although they have continually given person - al service, they have never been paid salaries except when some special service was rendered besides the actual operation of the line. For those services, they were paid expenses and a per diem. OPERATING REVENUES AND EXPENSES It will only be necessary to give a statement for the operating ex - penses and revenues for the years 1915, 1916 and 1917 to show, the gen - eral financial condition of the company. Receipts Expenditures This deficit has accrued for the three years after operating expenses and interest on the outstanding indebtedness have been paid, but dees not include any dividends to the stockholders. The engineering department of the Commission made a generfl study as to the per cent condition of the properties, and its report, as testi - fied to at the hearing, shows that the properties are in a very bad state of depreciation and that, on the average, they are not in more than 35 per cent condition. A casual observation by one riding over the line would convince him that the properties were in a very bad state of re - pair and actually unsafe for the traveling public. The company has not been able to keep the property in a better state of repair on account of not having the means with which to do it. Counsel for the two cities referred to and for the county of Dakota did not contend that the proper - ties should not be abandoned, but the main question m their minds seemed to be the abandonment of all rights and franchises the company has for the use and occupancy of streets, alleys, and public highways. The Commission does not think it necessary to enter into a detailed dis - cussion of the financial condition of the company and of the traffic mov: n 1915 n 1916 n 1917 $5,776.79 6,294.25 6,390.45 $5,699.90 6,262.89 6.562.58 Total Total deficit $18,461.49 $18,525.37 $6.V8S </seg>

The two cities referred to are now served with iwo steam railroads which parallel the lines of the applicant. Said six-am railroads enter the city of Sioux City, Iowa. The steam railroads, in the opinion of the Commission, render adequate passenger, freight and express service between the points named. It might be well, however, at this point to note the fact that the Crystal Lake Park has practxally abandoned that immediate part of the park which was reached by the spur of the applicant's lines, and has transferred the principal place of amusement to the opposite side of the lake which cannot be reached by the street car line, and will be largely patronized by the automobile traffic. The Commission is of the opinion that its authority should be granted to the applicant for removal and abandonment of its facilities, and the abandonment of the service now rendered, but that the com - pany should take immediate steps to dissolve the corporation and exe - cute releases of all franchise rights that it may have for the use and oc - cupancy of the streets and alleys of South Sioux City, Dakota City, and the public highway. The Commission is also of the opinion that the ap - plicant should make a thorough cleaning-up of all debris on the streets. alleys, public highway and private grounds in abandoning their proper - ties; that it should leave the streets, alleys, public highways and private grounds in a smooth, serviceable condition; and for the purpose of guar - anteeing that said work will be done in accordance with the above con - ditions, the applicant should execute a bond in the penal sum of $500 running to the cities of South Sioux City and Dakota City, and Dakota county, said bond to be approved by the Commission. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the applicant herein be and the same is hereby authorized tc abandon its facilities and service and the service on its lines opoiatcd in South Sioux City, Dakota City, to Crystal Lake, and to lines running between said cities. Upon the condition, however, that it take immedi - ate steps to dissolve the corporation and that it will release all fran - chise rights it may own for the occupancy of streets il'evo an 1 public highways in South Sioux City, Dakota City, and in Dakn*-'. county; and that it will remove all debris from all public and private grounds and leave the surface of all ircunds in a smooth, serviceable condition; and that it will deed back all nrivate right of ways it may own to the original land owners or their successors; that the applicant will execute a bond in the penal sum of $500 running to the cities of South Sioux City, Da - kota City and to Dakota county, guaranteeing- the faithful perforimnce of the requirements of this order, said bond to be approved by the Rail - way Commission and pla&lt; .', nn file by the applicant in the office of the County Clerk of Dakota t'uuniy.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3495 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for Authority to Publish Optional Zone Rate* at Beaver Crossing, Nebraska. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: Applicant herein has asked authority to file the following optional rates for town service on its Beaver Crossing exchange: Individual business, Beaver Crossing zone $2.50 per mo. Individual residence. Beaver Crossing zone 1.50 per mo. Two-party residence, Beaver Crossing exchange only 1.25 per mo. The Beaver Crossing zone mentioned above includes the Beaver Crossing exchange, Cordova exchange, farm lines on the Utica exchange south of Utica, and farm lines on the Tamora exchange south of Tamora. To complete this proposed scheme of service, applicant has also asked authority to offer to subscribers on the Cordova exchange the right to choose added exchange service to Beaver Crossing rather than to Exeter. Present exchange rates of applicant company which would be retained at the option of subscriber if this application were approved are as follows: Individual business Two-party business $1.50 per month 1.50 per month 1.00 per month Individual and two-party residence Farm line service is not affected in this application. These optional zone rates proposed by the applicant are identical with optional rates approved by the Commission for the Uticu exchange of this same company under certain restrictions, and the zone scheme of service and other conditions are practically the same. Citizens of Beaver Crossing have been well advised of the pendency </seg>
            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 391 of this application inasmuch as there was. first, a demand for a zon« sprvice as pvidenced by informal complaints to the Commission, and second, a delegation &lt;&gt;' citizens held conferences on two occasions with applicant company's representatives in the office of the Commission respecting the boundaries of the zone service. No objection was raised by this delegation of citizens to the optional rates proposed, providing that this service should be given to those only who wanted it. As a result of the conferences, the application was amended to give added exchange service to Cordova rather than to Utica, as respondent citi - zens showed that a community of interest existed between Cordova and Beaver Crossing. Applicant company has made no allegation that its revenues from the Beaver Crossing exchange are not a fair return on the stockholders' investment in that plant. It does not even allege that an increase in revenue is one of the features leading to the application. Hence, it Las made no showing as to earnings and disbursements on the Beaver Cross - ing exchange, nor as to the value of the property devoted to telephone service. The Commission is not advised as to the possible effect on the revenues of the applicant if these optional zone rates are put into effect, nor whether applicant would receive more than a just return as a result of such proposed rates. The applicant has, however, rebuilt its town exchange, and the Commission is of the opinion that the zone service proffered warrants a considerable advance in rate over the rates published for the class of service heretofore given and coincidentally hereafter to be given on the Beaver Crossing exchange. It is of the opinion that the optional rates as set forth heretofore should be approved and that the question of the return on the property should be left for later determination upon request of applicant, and that until such determination, applicant com - pany should be prohibited from distributing any portion of the revenues derived from the Beaver Crossing exchange in excess of current expenses, maintenance, taxes, insurance, and loss and damage, and that it should hold all surplus revenue subject to such further determination. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be, and it is hereby, authorized to charge and collect from all who desire the class of service thereunder, in addition to the Beaver Crossing exchange of the rates now in force and effect on applicant company, rates as follows: Individual business. Beaver Crossing zone 12.50 per mo. Individual residence, Beaver Crossing zone 1.50 per mo. Two-party residence. Beaver Crossing exchange only 1.25 per mo. </seg>

BROWNE, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3504 In the Matter of the Application of the Grant Telephone Company for Authority to In - crease Rates. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: This is an application for authority to increase telephone rates 25 cents per month on all classes of service and to publish and collect after the effective date net charges of $2.25 for business service and $1.50 for residence service. Applicant owns an exchange to which are connected twenty-eight business subscribers and thirty-eight residence subscribers. It also switches for 150 farm line stations independently owned where the lines are brought to the city limits and there connected to applicant's property. The exchange is far below the size at which unit costs of operation are at a minimum. Even an exchange such as this must have the attention of a lineman. If the lineman is collector and manager as well, and even if part of the operating is done by this individual, the maintenance cost as a result of that portion of his salary which must be charged up to repair of lines is a very considerable percentage of the book cost of the property. The limited extent of applicant's property and the very limited maxi - mum earnings, which are approximately $300 per annum, have made it </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 393 impossible to properly maintain the lines. The treasurer of applicant company gives a description of operating experiences in the past year or two which indicates that service is far below that which any company holding itself out to serve the public should render. It has been impossible to keep a lineman. The company has also found that it had to increase the wages of the operator. It estimates that the requirement for the last half of 1918 for lineman and operator would be $100 per month. Other estimates are given as to rent, light, heat, taxes, etc. These estimates were evidently carelessly made as detailed reports of expenditures for the first ten and one-half months of 1918 do not in - dicate that the company has had to pay out as much as was anticipated. Applicants showing for the first ten and one-half months of 1918 is 11830 receipts and expenditures totalling $2158.75. There was a net loss in that time of $328 to the company. Among the items of expense is one of $173.04 for war savings stamps. This is not an operating expense but an investment. When due allowance is made for this error, the company's net loss is $155 for ten and one-halt months. Under the proposed rates, applicant will earn from subscribers' service $1080 per year. It will earn $630 as a maximum from switching service. While the evidence is not very definite, apparently the net toll earnings will not exceed $100 per year. Thus, the gross earnings which the company can hope to have in the next year or so will not be much above $1800 per annum. Applicant has $2500 of stock outstanding which was, according to testimony, paid for in cash. It is entitled to earn thereon not to exceed 8 per cent per annum. It is difficult to say because of the conflicting figures given what the cost of operation should be, but it is apparent that the wages of operator, rent, fuel, light, taxes and insurance will range from $550 to $600 per year as a total. After dividends of $200 are provided for, the company will have left approximately $1000 with which to pay interest charges on bills outstanding, pay the lineman's expenses, the cost of all materials for upkeep and materials for replacement, and to create a surplus in the bank with which to meet sudden emergencies of line or switchboard disaster which might occur. In a company of this size, it is very difficult to estimate the proper proportion of lineman's wages which should be charged up against maintenance and replacement, but it is evidently a much higher per - centage than .would normally be figured. The Commission is of the opinion and finds that the increase of 25 cents per month on business and residence telephones should be author - ized effective January 1, 1919. The company will, however, be limited to dividends of not to exceed 8 per cent on the outstanding stock and will be required to separate in its accounts the cost of labor and ma - terial which may be used in extensions of the plant from the cost of labor and material used in general upkeep of existing property </seg>

            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 395 ice to the people of Union and vicinity. There were sixty stockholders in thp beginning, each of whom paid $20.00 in cash, furnished a tele - phone instrument at a cost of $12.00, and contributed the labor neceR - sary to construct the plant. Under the charter of the company, no stock - holder can own more than one share of stock. In 1915 the company pur - chased the competing plant of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph com - pany at a cost of $1,350. This plant was invoiced at the time at $3,474. No dividends have been paid to the stockholders in the fourteen years of the company's existence. The rates charged by the company at the present time are $1.00 per month for all classes of service. Permission is now desired to increase these rates to $1.25 per month. If to the original cash investment of $1,920 is added the purchase price of the Lincoln company's property and dividends at seven per cent on the investment during the period, we have an investment of ap - proximately $5 000. This represents only the cash investment and re - flects nothing for the contributions of labor and services which have been made to the property. The Commission's engineering department made a careful valuation of this property for this case and found a re - production new value of $11,555.40. and present, or depreciated value of $5,921.19. The present valu°, as found by the Commission's engineer, corresponds to an inventory made by Mr. Banning, secretary of the com - pany, in January of this year. At that time Mr. Banning found the pres - ent value of the property to be $5,600- It will be noted that the Com - mission's engineer found the property to be in a very depreciated con - dition, being but fifty-one per cent of the reproduction cost. This re - flects an abnormally low condition and indicates that a very large por - tion of the plant must be reconstructed at once. Mr. Banning, present secretary and manager of the company, confirms this conclusion and states that it is the plan of the company to improve the property as soon as there is sufficient revenue for that purpose. A statement of the operating expenses for the year ending June 30, 1917, based on figures submitted by applicant at the time of the hearing and on the last annual report of the company filed with the Commission, is as follows: Operators $ 540.00 Heat, light &amp; power 62.50 Stationery and advertising 32.00 HE, V EjFi Ut. 145 Farm @ $12 67 Residence @ $12 .. 11 Business ® $12 $1,740.00 ... 804.00 ... 132.00 223 Toll receipts $2,676.00 ... 232.00 $2,908.00 $2,908.00 EXPENSES </seg>

It is the practice of this Commission, based on experience and extended studies, to allow nine per cent of the reproduction new value of the prop - erty for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation. In a plant so small as this, however, such an allowance is insufficient and in lieu thereof the actual expenditures for maintenance and depreciation, as shown by the company, must be accepted. The company in the past has employed a lineman who divided his time between the village light plant and the telephone company. For the past two months, however, the telephone company has had no lineman and it is the opinion of Secretary Banning that it will be necessary to pay at least $100, and possibly $125 per month to secure a competent man. The secretary and manager of the company has been allowed $100 per year for his service and the treasurer $12.00 per year; but owing to a lack of funds, these salaries were not paid for the year 1917. The officers of the company are not concerned about the non-payment of their salaries, being willing to contribute their services for the welfare of the company, nor are the stockholders demanding dividends. There is a demand, however, for better service and the desire on the part of the management to improve the property. If the rates are increased, the added revenue will all be used in additions and betterments. It is manifest that if this property is restored to a condition to furnish adequate service to the people of that community, it must have more revenue. At the present time the company has 223 subscribers. An increase of $3.00 per year would pro - duce additional revenue to the amount of $669.00. In the opinion of the Commission this increase is reasonably necessary for the purposes of the company. At the present time there is stock issued and outstanding to the amount of $4,600.00. $2,680.00 of this amount was issued during the </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 397 past year without the approval of this Commission and for that reason is invalid. It is apparent from this record, however, that such an amount of stock is warranted by the actual investment of the stock - holders in the property and that there was no intent on the part of the management to commit fraud when the stock was issued. For that rea - son the additional issue will be validated at this time.

Appearances: For applicant, John L. Webster, general solicitor. For City of Omaha, W. C. Lambert, corporation counsel. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission The Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company, applicant herein, owns and operates an extensive street railway system In the cities of Omaha, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs, Iowa, the parts being </seg>
            <seg id="p396">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 398 connected by an interurban line between the two cities, with a bridge across the Missouri river. The properties upon the Nebraska side are owned by the company but those upon the Iowa side, which begin at the west bank of the Missouri river, are owned by a separate company and are operated under a lease by the applicant. There is also a small loop on the Nebraska side which is used by the cars that are run upon the Iowa side. The company first filed an application asking for an increase in street car fares from five cents to six cents per intrastate passenger carried upon the Nebraska lines. It subsequently filed an amended and supplementary application in which an increase to seven cents per pas - senger was prayed. The first application sets forth that since the com - ing on of the European war the wages of the employes of the company have greatly advanced; the cost of fuel, supplies and materials neces - sary for the operation and maintenance of its properties have increased all taken together amounting to about $733,768.51, of which increase $595,466.10 is within the limits of the city of Omaha; that demands are being made for further wage increases; that notwithstanding the in creased cost of operation the company has not enjoyed any material growth of income; that the income from all fares in Nebraska was $2,632,970.71 in 1917 and is $2,640,000.00 (estimated) in 1918; that the five-cent fare in Nebraska amounted to $2,583,241.65 in 1917 and will be $2,590,334.00 (estimated) in 1918; that the operating expenses for the system were $2,017,731.34 in 1917 and are $2,342,000.00 (estimated) in 1918; that the operating expenses within the corporate limits of the city of Omaha were $1,741,750.66 in 1917 and are $1,995,925.72 (estimated) in 1918; that the taxes of the system — city, county, state and federal — have increased nearly 50% from 1914 to 1918, being $233,126.35 in the former year and $350,000.00 in the present year; that the interest on the outstanding bonds of the company, a failure to pay which would result in a receivership, increased from $449,086.09 in 1913 to $480,950.00 in 1918; that there was a surplus of $33,027.87 in 1914 and $42,108.43 in 1917; that by reason of the increased operating expenses there will be no surplus in 1918, but instead thereof a deficit of $315,000.00 (esti - mated); that the company has about twelve hundred employes; that the wages of trainmen have been increased five cents per hour and the pay of other employes has been increased in like proportion to their wages since July 1, 1917; that the employes demand further increases, which will amount to $200,000.00 per year; that increased service is desired by the public but cannot be rendered on account of the existing scale of wages; that the increased fare would add an estimated amount of $480,815.92 annually to the revenues; that owing to the increased cost of operation and maintenance the company has spent since the summer of 1914 all of its surplus for betterments, improvements and extensions, all of which were necessary to maintain efficient and proper service, and that the company now has insufficient funds with which to operate without an increase of fares. ▲11 of the foregoing matters are set forth in much detail and are </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 399 followed by a prayer for an increase to six cents for each passenger cairied In lieu of the existing five-cent fare. The city of Omaha appeared and objected to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The objection was argued at length and overruled by the Commission. The Commission and not the city of Omaha has jurisdic - tion of the rates of the applicant. Thereafter a supplementary implication was filed, setting forth that since the entry of the United States into the European war the Federal Go\ernment has taken control of the fixing of wages to be paid by street railway companies to their employes and has created a War Labor Borrd invested with power to receive petitions from street railway em - ployes for increases of pay and to hear and determine such petitions; that since the filing of the original application herein the employes of the applicant, through their unions, being Local Union No. 807, Amalga - mated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employes of America, and Local Union No. 82, Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen and Oilers, made application to the War Labor Board for increased wages; that a her.ring was duly had, which resulted in increasing the wage scale so that motormen and conductors should receive 41 cents per hour for the fim three months of service, 43 cents per hour for the next nine months, and 45 cents per hour thereafter, with extra pay for overtime running fiom 25&lt;7r to 100&lt;^ additional, with proportional increases for all other employes and with a minimum for adult male employes in the other bunches cf the company'.s service of 42V4 cents per hour; that the War Labcr Beard recemmended increased passenger fares; that after the beginning cf the war applicant had from time to time granted increases of pay to its motoimen and conductors, amounting to six cents par hour, with proportional increases to its other employes; that by reason of the increase in wages ordered by the War Labor Board and the other addi - tional expenses of operation and maintenance as set forth in its original api licatirn. its deficit will be so large as to require a seven cent fare in lieu of the five-cent fare now charged and the granting of a seven-cent fare for each passenger carried is prayed. The city of Omaha filed an answer, admitting that increases in the cost cf operation and maintenance had taken place, denying that they were as large as claimed by the applicant; alleging over-capitalization, that the fair value of all the property of the applicant employed in the public service does not exceed $9,000,000, and praying that no increase be granted to the applicant without thorough and painstaking investi - gation. The application refers, of course, only to the intrastate passenger fares. It is sufficiently broad to cover both emergency and permanent rates of fare, and will be treated by the Commission as an application for both. Upon the hearing applicant offered voluminous testimony, with many oxhibi'B, showing the value of lit physical properties and its financial condition. The Commission, through Its rate expert, Mr. Powell, offeied the results of its investigation as to the investment in the properties </seg>
            <seg id="p398">400 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT and the financial condition of the applicant as disclosed by its books. Ordinarily a physical valuation is not essential in determining the necessity of an emergency rate, but as testimony has been offered con - cerning such valuation and it will be one of the essential elements in ascertaining what the permanent rates of fare should be, we shall dis - cuss it briefly so as to point out what appear to be the principal de - ficiencies in the valuation offered by the applicant. The valuation, so far as it goes, is based entirely on present-day or war prices. We can - not view this as a proper basis of valuation, for it is conceded in the testimony offered by the applicant that prices are now extraordinarily high; that their advance has been very rapid and due to war condi - tions. This Commission is committed to the doctrine that unit prices cannot be fixed by taking prices at the time of the investigation and being governed solely by them. In re Monroe Independent Telephone Co., 10 N. S. R. C. 207-216, P. U. R. 1917-E. 475, this Commission, speak - ing by Commissioner Taylor, uses the following language: "The remaining differences are largely matters of cost units and judgment on the part of the engineers. In view of the painstaking investigation made by the Commission's engineers, we are inclined to accept their figures as being reasonable. Applicant makes claim to largely increased values, due to prevailing high prices of labor end materials. If conditions promised to make such prices perma - nent, there might be good reason for using them as a basis for valuation figures, but it is universally conceded that present condi - tions are abnormal and may terminate at any time. The figures used by the engineers of the Commission cover a ten-year average, included in this average being a portion of the period of high prices. Both properties were bought during the period of normal prices. During a portion of their history, prices were very low. It would be just as fair to base the reproduction cost of the property on the abnormally low prices as on the abnormally high prices. As a mat - ter of fact, it is more equitable to all parties to adopt an average, covering an extended period, as has been done by the Commission's engineers." The valuation is further defective in that no allowance whatever is made for depreciation except as to a few inconsiderable items. The claim is made by the expert employed by the applicant that as long as the properties are sufficient to perform their functions he thought no depreciation should be allowed, notwithstanding the fact that some of the units of property had been in use for a number of years. It was shown that certain of the boilers had been used for several years, and in fact had been overhauled, yet he put them in at the same figure that new boilers of the same kind would now cost. We cannot blind ourselves to the fact that property deteriorates from the moment it Is put in place. We consider that a valuation which leaves out this im - portant consideration is incorrect. It is not shown anywhere in the evi - dence whether the properties of the applicant were depreciated at the time they were acquired from the companies which were consolidated into the present company or not. Much of the property now in use was doubtless acquired from the old companies, so that in order to ha\e any basis for fixing rates upon a valuation made at this time it would be </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA 8TATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 401 necessary to have knowledge of the condition of the property at the time it was taken over by the applicant. Furthermore, there are several items included in the valuation which are plainly inadmissible. The real estate was valued by a real estate dealer of Omaha, who did not appear as a witness. He has included in his valuation certain percentages as special values of the property for the purposes of the applicant. It is unnecessary to cite authorities to the effect that It is the actual market value and not any special value for a particular purpose that must govern in such cases. Wholly with - out evidence and as pure estimates, the expert of the company included charges for engineering and superintendence, legal and general expenses, interest and taxes during construction and going value, all aggregating $3,882,890. It would be useless to speculate upon the amount of such items. It may be, and very likely is, true that certain of such expenses were incurred, but in the absence of any testimony in regard thereto it is impossible to say what the amount was, and in the absence of any testimony showing out of what funds they were paid it is impossible to say whether or not any of such items should be included in the charges to capital. It may be that they were all paid out of operating revenues and cannot be properly included as capital charges. The vice of the metftod of arriving at a value by means of arbitrary percentages is shown in the item of $822,130.00 which is included by the expert as "working capital." The only evidence upon the subject is that on De cember 31, 1917, the cash on hand amount to $449,297.97, and judging from the evidence it was probably a smaller sum on July 1, 1918. It should be stated that the expert's estimate did not include anything for materials and supplies, as they were contained in a separate item amounting to $439,930. which had been already included in his figures To add almost $400,000 of imaginary working capital as one of the items en which rates should be based is to condemn his entire valuation. Be - fore this case is finally submitted as an application for permanent rates an adequate physical valuation will be required. Coming to the accounting studies furnished by the applicant, it is shown that there has been a surplus each year from 1914 to 1917, in - clusive. There is an estimated deficit for 1918 of $369,450. In arriving at the deficit there is included $399,600 of dividends, of which $199,600 is dividends on the common stock. As there is no sufficient showing as to the actual value of the property, it is impossible to say whether or not the dividends should be allowed in the amount claimed. As the company had an accumulated surplus of $358,678.30 invested in additions and betterments, a depreciation reserve amounting to $1,393,930, likewise invested, had materials and supplies on hand aggregating $439,930 on July 31. 1918, and cash to fhe amount of $449,297.27 on December 31, 1917, and a net income of $174,493.70 for the first eight months of 1918. which net income remains after making all deductions claimed by the applicant except that for dividends, it is apparent that there is no imme diate danger of a receivership. This is particularly apparent when it h recalled that in the operating expenses there was Included annually the </seg>
            <seg id="p400">402 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT sum of $300,000 for the depreciation reserve fund, whereas the most money that has been expended in any recent year is $175,179.16, which was used in 1916. In 1917 the amount expended therefrom was $110, - 145.59. We are not discussing this matter as a finality, however, as it must be gone over in far greater detail when the case comes on for final determination. Enough has been said, however, to show that ample funds remain for all liabilities that are urgent. As there is no showing as to the value of the property, we should not be warranted in making an emergency rate to cover dividends. The most serious difficulty in respect to the evidence is its failure to disclose the relation between the Nebraska property and the Iowa prop - erty in the matter of operating expenses. There is no attempt to show the value of the Iowa property or what the several items of expenses are in its operation and maintenance. General figures can be arrived at by a deduction of the expenses of the Nebraska property from the ex penses for the system, but the results do not show whether or not the Iowa property is profitable. The only direct testimony is the impression of the applicant's secretary and auditor, that the property is profitable, but nothing is given in the way of actual data on the subject. There is no separation of the general expenses between the Nebraska and the Iowa properties. The general expenses are not separated from the operating expenses so it is not possible to say what part should be charged to the property upon this side of the river. The same is true of the taxes, which reached the amount of $343,350 in 1918. Further than that there is no allocation of the expense of the general power plant. All of the power used on both sides of the river is furnished by the central power plant at Omaha. The allocation seems to be made upon the car mile basis, but no figures are given showing the car mileage on either side of the river nor the passenger miles on either side, so it is impossible to say whether or not a passenger carried one mile upon the Iowa side pays as large an amount as does the passenger carried one mile on the Nebraska side. Without the assignment of these expenses upon proper bases, it would be impossible to say that an emergency exists. In what we have said thus far, as to the physical valuation sub - mitted by the applicant, states some of the reasons why the valuation as offered of record, cannot be used as a basis for finding the fair value of the applicant's property. In numerous decisions heretofore entered it has been the policy of the Commission to give consideration to the ori - ginal cost of the plant, the cost of the property put in place, included in the inventory and valuation, that had come from operating revenues. All these matters materially assist the Commission in determining the fair value of the property used by the public. In the consideration of this case the Commission finds that, if the applicant had made a satisfactory showing as to the several items men - tioned, and which are necessary for the Commission to finally arrive at a fair value of the property for the purpose of a return .the Commission could not enter a final order In this application, for the reason that no </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 403 showing has been made by the applicant as to the net income from the operation of its property in Nebraska. In the exhibiiR introduced by Mr. Nicholson, auditor of the company, consisting of many pages, no statement was made as to the final results of operation of the company's lines in Nebraska. In Exhibit No. 1 Mr. Nicholson makes a showing for a five-year period of the revenues received by the applicant from passengers car - ried on its lines of road within Nebraska. In Exhibit No. 2 he attempts to show the operating expenses in curred by the applicant in handling the business on the company's lines in Nebraska. The balance of the exhibits are devoted exclusively to showing th: operating revenues and expenses, taxes, fixed charges and dividend pay merits from the results of operation of the company's entire lines, includ - ing those lines leased from the Council Bluffs Street Railway company. The applicant receives material revenues for the transportation of mail, for the rent of its tracks and facilities, and for numerous other services performed, none of which are included in Mr. Nicholson's Ex - hibit No. 1. For the last year of operation, namely, the year ending December 31, 1917, Exhibit No. 1 shows that the company received in revenue from passengers carried within the state of Nebraska $2,632,907.71. In Ex - hibit No. 2 Mr. Nicholson shows operation expenses for the same year for the operation of the lines in Nebraska $1,741,750.66. From the figures just stated it would appear that the Nebraska operating income to the applicant for the year 1917 was $891,157.05. There is no showing in any of the exhibits as to the amount of taxes paid by the company on its property within Nebraska. In Mr. Nicholson's Exhibit No. 9 it is shown that the company paid taxes for the calendar year 1917 in the amount of $321,139.89 for all kinds of taxes, city, occupation, county, state and federal, and that the said amount of taxes was paid for the entire system. As heretofore stated, no showing is made as to the amount of taxes properly chargeable to the Nebraska property, but assuming that all of the taxes were charged against the Nebraska lines, which, of course, would be incorrect, there would be a net income to the applicant for the operation of its lines in Nebraska for the year 1917 of $570,000 in round figures. The higher costs of operation as to wages of employes, and as to some of the materials used in operating the property, are not reflected in the 1917 figures. Taking the revenues and expenses as estimated by Mr. Nicholson and shown in Exhibits Noe. 1 and 2, the net operating in - come for the year ending December 31, 1918, is shown to be $538,000 minus. The estimated taxes, as shown by Exhibit No. 9, for this year are shown to be $350,000; making a deduction for the year 1918 in the same manner as heretofore stated for the year 1917, the net income to the applicant would be $208,000. </seg>
            <seg id="p402">404 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT* The applicant did not undertake to state the amount of fixed charges - which should be assessed against the Nebraska property. By reason of the failure of the applicant to make full and complete showing to the Commission as to the operating revenues, operating ex - penses and fixed charges properly chargeable against the Nebraska property, the Commission finds itself unable to determine whether or not the revenues collected by the applicant in Nebraska would be suffi - cient to pay a reasonable return upon a fair value of the property de - voted to the public use located in Nebraska. The Commission recognizes, however, that operating costs have in - creased materially in recent years, and that the present five-cent fare, if continued indefinitely, might not leave the company a fair return on its property in Nebraska. The Commission is therefore of the opinion, and so finds, that an emergency does not exist; but that this case should be continued for the taking of further testimony and in order to facilitate the investigation the Commission will immediately instruct its engineer - ing department to proceed to making a check of the inventory and physi - cal valuation returned by the applicant in testimony before the Com - mission in this case. The Commission will also instruct its accounting department to pro - ceed without delay to an investigation of the books and records of the company for the purpose of ascertaining as near as may be the cost to the applicant of the property devoted to the public use located in the state of Nebraska; and further, the accounting department will be in - structed to make a study of the results of operation of the company during its entire life for the purpose of determining the amount of money invested in property which came from the operating revenues of the applicant. An order will be entered in accordance with the findings herein.

Average earn - ings, including one-fourth of the gross receipts from outbound tolls, were $2,624.81 per annum. Average expenses for the same three years were $3,074.02. These expenses include a depreciation of seven per cent on a value of $50 per station and dividends of seven per cent on a present value of $45 per station. The Commission has not in the past authorized a depreciation of seven per cent, nor is it in a position to say that a depreciation is prop erly applied to a value of $50 per station, nor that the company is entitled to earn on a valuation of $45 per station. No earnings have been made by the company in justification of these two valuation fig - ures. But even taking into consideration possible readjustment of the depreciation and the earnings items, it is evident to the Commission that the company is entitled to more revenue from its Saronville ex - change and in reaching that conclusion it is mindful of the fact that service over the same territory is available to these subscribers as to the subscribers of Harvard where a rate was established, after hearing, much higher than has heretofore prevailed at Saronville. The increase proposed herein will give the company approximately $300 additional revenue. The Commission will authorize the rates asked for.

I, 12. 13 and 24, TIN R7W, between Sec. 2. 11, 14, 23, 26 and Sec. 1, 12, 13, 24. 25 and 36 of T2N R7W; between Sec. 35 and 36 of T3N R7W to the limits of the city of Nelson. Second: East from the limits of the city of Superior on the north side of the highway adjacent to Sec. 24 of TIN R7W, thence directly north on the west boundary of the highway lying east of Sec. 1, 12, 13 and 24 of TIN R7W, Sec. 1, 12, 13. 24, 25 and 36 of T2N R7W and Sec. 36 of T3N R7W. Applicant prefers the routing first named abovt because it is the most direct line between the two points Superior and Nelson. The highway in question is occupied en its east side by telephone lead of the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph company containing from eight to thirteen wires, and on its west side by lead of the Nuckolls County Inde - pendent Telephone company carrying from one to twelve wires. Under the provisions of the law, construction on the first named route would require the removal of the line of the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company to the opposite side of the roadway, and at one point the removal of the line of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company for a distance of approximately one-third of a mile, and the same lii;* - at another point for one-half mile. The alternative route second set out above is almost free from tele - phone wires. It involves the crossing of the tracks of the Burlinglon Railroad at one point only. By the first named route, the Burlington </seg>
            <seg id="p406">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 408 Railroad would be crossed four times and would be approximately paralleled for short distances. Because both telephone companies affected refused to sign agree - ments of construction, as per the provisions of the law, on the first named route, applicant asked for a hearing before this Commission to determine his rights in the premises, praying that after hearing, the Commission make a finding as to the rights, necessities and require - ments of the petitioner under the circumstances; that the west side of the main highway be ordered cleared of telephone wires on such terms as the Commission finds to be just and equitable; and that if the Com - mission finds it more practicable that the petitioner use the alternative route set out second above, then that the Commission first shall deter - mine the terms on which the same shall be used, together with the pro - portionate part of the excess cost to the petitioner due to excess mileage which shall be borne by each of the telephone companies. Hearing was had on this application in the office of the Commission on Monday, May 29. Due to error on the part of petitioner, it was not represented. The Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company was represented by H. A. Brubaker. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company was represented by C. Petrus Peterson, attorney. Formal objections to construction on the first named route wer" filed by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company and the NuckolU County Independent Telephone company setting forth the reasons for the objections to the proposed first named route, and praying that the Commission find and order that the petitioner construct its lines over the second named route and that respondents be not required to con - tribute to the cost of such construction. Testimony of respondents in support of the allegations of their answers and protests was taken and adjournment had on condition that if petitioner insisted on the right to occupy the first named route, then additional hearing should be had on the question of damage to the tele - phone companies' property by inductive interference. Petitioner later appeared and after informal conference with Com - missioner Taylor who had held the hearing for the entire Commission, and with the approval of the Commission, it was agreed that order should be issued authorizing petitioner to construct on the alternative route set forth above as the second route, reserving to petitioner the right to be heard in subsequent proceedings on the question of proper - distribution of the extra cost of constructing by said second named route over the cost properly attributable to petitioner from construction on the first named route, together with the moving of the lines of the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company to the opposite side of the highway on which it is located. Respondent, Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, has a farm line extending east for one mile from Superior, thence north on the opposite side of the highway second named route of the applicant com - pany for a distance of four and one-half miles. Respondent, Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company, has two service lines on the </seg>

The. Commission will not, at this time, pass upon the question of damage to these lines due to inductive interference, but will leave that question open to later adjudication if complaint is filed by the owners of slid telephone lines alleging serious interference, whereupon the Commission will pass upon the necessary remedy and designate who shall bear the cost thereof. Respondent. Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company, has a farm service line adjacent to and on the east side of Sec. 1, T2N R7W for a distance of approximately one-half mile which will be overbuilt by the power line of applicant when following the alternative route hereto - fore mentioned as the proper route to follow. The Commission is of 'he opinion and sc finds that this overbuilding should not be permitted and that applicant. Southern Nebraska Power company, shall move said service line to the opposite side of the highway. The question of dam - age due to inductive interference on this half-mile service line shall be disposed of in the manner heretofore mentioned concerning other farm lines on the highway to be followed by applicant's power line. ORDER IT JS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission in pursuance of the provisions of Chapter 242 of the Session Laws of Nebraska for the year 1915, as amended by Chapter 154 of the Session Laws of Nebraska for the year 1917, and none other, that the Southern Nebraska Power company be, and it hereby is, authorized to construct an electric transmission line to transport electric current at a pressure of not more than 13,200 volts along the route set forth in the description of the second, or alternative, route described heretofore. Said construction shall be in accordance with the specifications filed as an exhibit with the application. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant company shall have the right to raise the question of the distribution of the difference in the cost of constructing the line as per the route herein required to be fol - lowed and the cost of building on the line first described heretofore, together with applicant's proper share of the cost of moving the tele - phone line of the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company to the opposite side of the highway. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the question of inductive inter - ference and damage thereby to farm lines on the opposite side of the highway which is to be followed by the power line shall be left to later consideration upon complaint and consideration in subsequent proceed - ings that damage to telephone property has resulted from the construc - tion of the transmission line. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant, Southern Nebraska Power company, shall move one-half mile of pole line adjacent to Sec. 1, T2N R7W to the opposite side of the highway at its own cost. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3565 In the Matter of the Application of the Firth Telephone Company for Increase in Rates. Appearances: For. applicant. William H. James, president, and J. C Ruigh. secretary. FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner This is an applicatii n for an increase of service rates from $1.00 per month to $1.25 p^ r month for all classes of service. The number of telephones according to use are. 24 business. 45 village residence, and 2&lt;"4 farm residence, rf which 22 are single line and the remainder party - line. The same rate for all classes of service is due to the fact that the company is a co-operative concern, there being 159 shares of capital stock in force and 146 stockholders. The company began operation in the year 1905 and the rate has been $1.00 per month for all classes of service all of the time. Prior to 1916 the stockholders paid assess - ments in lieu of rentals, amounting to $3.00 per share per year for th? years 1906 to 1908. inclusive and $4.00 per share for the years 1909 to 1915. inclusive. All other subscribers paid the dollar rate. No divi - dends were paid to stockholders during this period, but the difference between the annual rates paid by non-stockholders and the assessments paid by the stockholders is in fact a return to the stockholders. The business of the company has been very successful. The plant appears to have been installed at a minimum of cost and the expenses of operation have likewise been very low. No overhead costs have been incurred until recent years and the secretary of the company receives only $250 per annum for his services. The directors received nothing for their services until the last year or two, during which they were paid $2.00 a meeting, and meetings were held three or four times a year only. The total overhead expense during the entire history of the plant appears not to have exceeded $1,000. Individual stockholders ap - pear to have contributed more or less labor in the construction of the plant. A statement of the capital paid in. the rebates to stockholders undev the assessment plan followed, a return of 8% per annum upon the capi- </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 411 lal paid in, and the excess return to stockholders above 8% per annum for each of the years of the life of the company, is as follows. In 1916 the assessment plan was abandoned and stockholder sub - scribers paid the same rates as non-stockholders. A dividend of 12% was declared and paid during that year, which should be added to the total of rebates shown in the foregoing statement in computing the re - turn paid to stockholders. A continuation to date of the foregoing statement is as follows: No part of the revenues has ever been set aside to cover deprecia - tion in the company's property and the time is near at hand when a considerable part of the plant will have to be replaced. The aerial equip - ment is thirteen years old and the record shows that the poles and cross-arms are in poor condition. The poles need resetting at an early date, and probably 90"^ of them will have to be replaced during the next seven years. Considerable depreciation exists also in the wire and some has accrued in the switchboard, though it is only five years old. The Commission's engineer estimates the existing depreciation of the whole plant at $5,000, based on a cost of replacement at 20 r r below existing prices of materials and labor. A public utility concern is obli - gated to set aside from earnings an amount sufficient to cover unreal - ized depreciation before any return is paid to stockholders. Applicant must therefore discharge this obligation before any return can accrue to stockholders in the future. The Commission finds, therefore, that all o! the surplus earnings remaining after paying the costs of operation taxes, losses, damages and overhead expenses shall be set aside to : maintenance and depreciation fund&gt; until such time as the excess returr above noted shall have been absorbed by a return calculated at 8 l I pe annum from January 1. 1919. upon the capital invested. Expenditure: may be made from said fund only on account of maintaining the plan in good operating condition, including replacements and betterments. fear 906 90 r 90S 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 Capital $5,050 6.000 6,300 6.400 6,600 6.650 7,800 7,800 8,000 8,100 Rebates $ 909 1.080 1.038 1.001 1.056 1.064 1.068 1,248 1.064 1.116 8% : Per Annum $ 404 480 .-,114 512 :.2s 532 624 HIM 640 648 Excess Return $ 505 600 ■:,:&gt;, t 489 528 114 624 424 468 Total $10,644 $5,496 $5,148 fear Capital ( Brought forward ) 916 8,150 917 8.250 918 8.250 KeDates $10,644 978 8 &gt;er Annum $5,496 652 660 660 Excess Return $5,148 32« Deficit 66n 660 Total .$11,622 $7,468 $4,154 </seg>

A dividend of $978 was paid during 1917 which absorbed all of the net operating income for the year and created an actual overdraft with the treasurer. The record shows that there will be no net operating income for 1918 owing to the increased costs of operation and the extent of re- placements of worn-out property. Applicant will be unable to maintain its plant in good operating condition under the present scale jf rates, to say nothing of setting aside a reserve for unrealized depreciation. There is no obligation, however, on the ratepayers to provide revenues for a return to stockholders for a little more than five years to come due to previous payment to stockholders of a reasonable return for lhat period. assuming that no additional capital is invested. A return of 8% upon the investment results in an annual return of $660. Dividing this annual return into the excess return already paid to stockholders of $4,154 gives the number of future years during which stockholders would not be entitled to earn a return, or 5.2 plus years. An increase of twenty-five pents per month in subscribers' rates will yield $939 per annum, accord </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 413 ing to the present number of subscribers. Such a rate will doubtless permit of a credit to maintenance and depreciation fund about $l,50J annually over and above the cost of ordinary repairs, and enable appli - cant to maintain its plant in first-class condition. The record shows that a number of country lines are heavily burdened with subscribers. These should be reduced to ten subscribers to the line as soon as possible in order to bring the service up to the standard governing in plants of this character. The Commission finds, therefore, that a rate of $1.25 for the service furnished applicant's subscribers is just and reasonable, subject to the creation of a balance in the fund for maintenance and depreciation and to the limitation of the return to stockholders as above set forth. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Firth Telephone company be and the same is hereby authorized and directed from and after January 1, 1919, to charge, collect and receive a rate of $1.25 per month for the telephone service furnished by it to regular subscribers, subject to the following conditions : (1) No return shall accrue to stockholders on account of stock now in force until on and after January 1, 1924. (2) The balance of all revenues, including the net revenue from toll service after paying the costs of operation, taxes, interest, losses, damages and general expenses, shall be credited to a fund to be known as maintenance and depreciation fund. Expenditures may be made from said fund only on account of maintaining the plant in good operating condition and in defraying the cost of all replacements and additions necessary to the rendition of such service.

            <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 415 At the hearing held by the Commission on June 6, 191R. a large number of communities served by these trains were represented. The spirit manifested by the representatives of the public was excellent, all the spokesmen expressing a willingness to have the service reduced if the necessities of the war situation demand. There was a disposition, however, to analyze the reasons offered by the company for the removal of the trains and to make sure that substantial saving of men, fuel, and equipment would be secured by the public's sacrifice of the service. General Manager Jeffers of the Union Pacific testified that the com - pany has lost by enlistment or draft 1,778 men up to April 30, 1918, and that the shortage in man-power is the most serious problem now con - fronting the company. Various expedients have been adopted to re - cruit the labor forces. The physical and mental examinations of appli - cants for positions have been made much less rigid; enforcement of disciplinary rules has been considerably relaxed; men retired from th? service have been induced to return and the age limit of retirement advancd; men injured in the service through the loss of some member of the body have been transferred to positions where their physical dis - ability will not interfere with their duties. In spite of these measures, however, there is a shortage of men. aggregating, in all departments of the service, 782. Of this number, 211 are in the transportation service and consist of engineers, firemen, brakemen, and conductors. There is a shortage likewise of locomotives. On the main line between Council Bluffs and Ogden the traffic is considerably heavier than last year at this period. With respect to coal, the company now has in store 100,000 tons more than last year at this time, but vigorous efforts are being made to increase the reserve supply to 500,000 tons. The situation at times last year was critical, the company having on hand on a few occasions less than a day's requirements. It is desired to avoid a repetition of a like situation this winter, although difficulty is being experienced in adding to the reserve supply. With the exception of Nos. 23 and 24, the Albion-Omaha trains, all of the trains involved in the application consist of gasoline motors. The discontinuance of these trains, therefore, will result in the saving of coal and locomotives only to the extent that it is now necessary to maintain and operate steam trains when the motors are out of order. The discon- tinuance of the trains will release a number of men who can be put into other service at once. The crews of Xos. 23 and 24 will not be re lieved as it is proposed to continue those trains between Columbus and Omaha. It is not unlikely, moreover, that the removal of one of the motors on the branch from Kearney to Stapleton will necessitate thr substitution of a steam train for the remaining motor in order to handle the traffic. Should this prove to be the case, the saving on that branch will be practically nothing. While the curtailment of the service as proposed promises to se - cure but little in the way of conservation of men, fuel, and equipment, the Commission feel 1 -, constrained to defer to the request of the Railroad Administration and approve the application, subject to certain modifica- </seg>
            <seg id="p414">416 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT tions and to the conditions that the service shall be restored at the end of a year unless we find that the period should be extended at that time. Dissatisfaction was expressed by patrons of some of the branches as to some of the trains selected for removal. Representatives from every town on the Kearney-Stapleton line, except Kearney, asked that if any trains have to be removed from that branch that it be Nos. 519 ai 520 rather than Nos. 517 and 518. No. 517 now departs from Kearney in the morning, carrying the mail and express, arriving from the east the evening previous. It returns as No. 518 in the afternoon. Nos. 519 and 520 reverse the schedule, arriving at Kearney in the morning and returning to Stapleton in the afternoon. In view of the almost unani - mous demand for the retention of Nos. 517 and 518, it appears to the Commission that the other trains should be removed instead. The removal of the motor between Ord and Grand Island is objected to because, it being the only Sunday train on that branch its discon - tinuance leaves the towns without any mail or passenger service for that day. It is suggested that if the motor is removed, that the steam passenger trains, Nos. 35 and 36, which operate daily except Sunday, be required to make a Sunday trip. Train No. 36 at the present time leaves Ord at 7:20 in the morning and reaches Grand Island at 9:55 a. m. It returns in the afternoon, arriving at Ord at 5:30 p. m. The Commission believes this to be a reasonable request and will make the change a condition of its order. The same complaint arises with respect to the service between Lincoln and Central City. The motor which it is proposed to remove is the only Sunday train. The steam passenger train, which operates daily except Sunday, leaves Grand Island at 5:30 a. m. and runs to Omaha via the Stromsburg branch. It returns in the afternoon, reaching Grand Island at 7 : 50 p. m. This train, in the opinion of the Commission, should make a Sunday trip, running to Lincoln, how - ever, instead of Omaha. While the schedule will not provide the same service as now furnished by the motor, it will enable people on that branch to go to and from Lincoln and intermediate points, and provide a mail service which otherwise would be entirely lacking. Similar Sunday service should be provided for the Spalding and Albion branches, by the operation of steam trains on that day. Steam train No. 32, which leaves Spalding in the morning at 9:15, reaching Genoa at 11:00 a. m., and returns as No. 31, leaving Genoa at 2:10 p. m. and arriving at Spalding at 4:00 p. m.. should, in our opinion, be run on Sunday. Trains Nos. 23 and 24, which now operate between Omaha and Albion, but which it is proposed to have run only between Omaha and Columbus, should continue to make the Sunday trip to Albion. The added expense of this Sunday service will be slight, but the accommodation to the public will be very great Representatives from Beatrice objected to the removal of the motor service between Lincoln, Beatrice and Manhattan, Kansas, in - sisting, as an alternative, that the steam train be discontinued. It was pointed out by General Manager Jeffers that the express, baggage, and mail is too heavy to be handled by the motor and that the steam train </seg>
            <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 417 Would have to be retained for that reason. An investigation of this matter, made sine** the hearing, has convinced tho Beatrice people of the truth of this contention and they have withdrawn their protest.

            <seg id="p416">418 KLfcVlSNTH ANNUAL kttPOftT APPLICATION NO. 358S In the matter ef the Application of the Union Pacific Railroad Company for Authority to Discontinue Certain Train Service on V»n out Branch Line*. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: With reference to the Sunday service on the Albion branch, re - quired by the Commission in its original order in this case, applicam represents that it will be necessary to make two full trips with the steam passenger train between Columbus and Albion in order to provide service each way on Sunday. In other words, No. 23 would have to run to Albion Saturday evening in order to be ready for the start from Albicn Sunday morning. Likewise, No. 24 would have to run to Albion Sunday evening and return the following morning. As an alternative, applicant suggests that Nos. 31 and 32. the steam trains serving the Spalding bianch, be required to make the trip from Genoa to Albion and leturn on Sunday, thus providing the service desired at the mini mum of expense and inconvenience. This could be accomplished by starting the eastbound train out of Spalding about two hours earlier and having it arrive at that terminus somewhat later in the afternoon. On such a schedule it would leave and arrive at Albion at practically the same time as Nos. 33 and 34, the daily passenger trains. This appears to the Commission to be a very satisfactory solution of the problem. It will be inconvenient to persons to and from the Spald ing branch, who will have a wait of one hour and forty-five minutes a' Genoa, but it applies only to the Sunday service on that branch and the disadvantage is more than compensated for by the economies accora plished. Nos. 23 and 24, now operating between Albion and Omaha, will be discontinued between Albion and Columbus and will not operate west of Columbus en the main line, as has been suggested in ■tentative plans made by applicant. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the original order in this case be. and the same hereby is, amended so as to provide Sunday service between Albion and Columbus by the use of trains Nos. 32 and 31, oper ating from Spalding to Genoa to Albion and thence to Columbus, r from Columbus to Albion to Genoa and thence to Spalding, on a schedule to be submitted by applicant.

            <seg id="p417">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 419 APPLICATION NO. 3594. In the Matter of the Application of the Staple - hurst Telephone Company for Authority to Increase its Exchange Rates Twenty-five Cents Per Month. Appearances: For Applicant, E. J. Erford, secretary; E. P. Moore, manager OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant operates a telephone exchange at Staplehurst, Nebraska, with 297 subscribers, 275 of whom are farm and residence isubscribeis, who pay $12.00 per year, and 22 who are business subscribers, paying $18.00 per year. The company desires authority to increase the rate:; fcr all classes of service twenty-five cents per month, or $3.00 per year. The lines of the company are all metallic. This company was organized in 1904 very largely as a community enterprise. It began to furnish service in the spring of 1905. It sold stock in small amounts to the people of the community from time to time in order to defray the cost of building the system. The stock out - standing on January 1, 1918, was $8,650. In 1911, however, the company had outstanding $9,350 in capital stock. From time to time since then the company has purchased the shares of fourteen stockholders, paying fcr the same from its treasury. No dividends have been paid by the company for the years 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909 or 1910. Divi dcnds running from 6% to 10% have been paid on the stock outstanding er.ch year since that time, with the exception of 1917 when no dividends were paid. On January 1, 1918, there was a surplus in cash in the treasury of the company amounting to $3,460. If to this is added th $700 which was paid by the company for the shares of stock repurchased from certain stockholders, the company had a surplus of $4,160 on tha date. Computing dividends from the date of organization of the com - pany down to January 1, 1918, on the basis of 7% of the capital stock outstanding at the end of each fiscal year and subtracting from tin amount thus obtained the amount actually paid in dividend*, we lisi the sum of $3,179.50 due to the stockholders of the company from tlr: source. During the past summer the company has been engaged in the election of a new central office building, which will cost $5,000. They have applied upon the cost of this building the surplus of $3,460 and ex - pect to have to borrow $1,540. If from the $1,540 of borrowed money we deduct the surplus remaining after the deduction of the unpaid divi - dends, we have a net capital indebtedness of $559.50. Adding io the out - standing capital of $8,650 the $559.50 of net borrowed capiuil and the $3,179.50 of unpaid dividends, we have a figure of $12,389, which rep.c senu approximately the sacrifice of the stockholders in the property. The property investment as of January 1, 1918, was $16,100. This amount, of course, will be increased by the cost of the new building </seg>
            <seg id="p418">420 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT less the salvage value of the old building replaced. The present, or depreciated, value of the property will probably be in the neighborhood of $12,000 or $14,000. Like all other utilities, this company is met with a constantly in - creasing scale of prices, both for labor and material. It has already in - creased the salary of its lineman, who in the past has been receiving $120 per month and house rent. Out of the amount thus paid in, he has paid the salaries of two operators at $25.00 per month each. It has been necessary to increase his compensation to $145.00 per month in addition to the house rent. A representative revenue and expense statement foi the company, covering a period of a year, is as follows: : that the plant is belli:? operated at a minimum of expense. The only salary paid in addition to that paid to the lineman and manager is $10.00 per month to the secretary, who, together with the president, constitute the executive force. The president and directors of the company re - ceive no compensation, nor have they since the organization of the company. The lines of the company are in poor condition, anl accord - ing to the testimony of the lineman will all have to be replaced in the very near future. No extensive reconstruction has been done since the plant was first built. It is apparent from the foregoing that a proper reserve for depreciation has not been set up by the company, net - withstanding the dividends have been inadequate. Large expenditures EARNINGS 275 farm and residence at $12.00 $3,300.00 22 business at $18.00 396.00 Toll, net _ 650.70 Total $4,346.70 EXPENSES Operators $1,080.00 Light, heat, etc 93.06 Incidental 197.76 $1,370.82 Secretary $ 120.00 Collections 60.00 Insurance 25.90 Taxes _ 130.87 336.77 Maintenance and depreciation 10% on $16.400 1,640.00 $3,347.59 $ 999.11 2% for uncollectible acounts 88.52 $ 910.59 Dividends 867.23 $ 43.36 In connection with the above statement it is necessary to consider </seg>
            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 421 will be necessary to put the plant in condition to give proper service. Such expenditures must necessarily come from the revenue. Unless the rates are increased, it will be impossible to reconstruct the property and at the same time pay any adequate earning on the investment. It would appear, therefore, that the increase as asked for by the company is reasonable and should be allowed. (IHIIKK IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Staplehurst Telephone company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to charge and collect the following schedule of rates for its exchange service at Staplehurst: Business telephones Residence telephones Farm telephones $21.00 per year 15.00 per year 15.00 per year IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that 'a sum equal to ten per cent of the book value of the physical property, exclusive of real estate, shall be set aside annually for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation, such sum to include that portion of the lineman's salary devoted to main - tenance work.

The total receipts by months showed that the revenues received at that station for Total receipts $832.40 An itemized statement ot the expenses {or the same months showed that the total expense incurred (or the same months was $600.91. The remonstrators admit that the traffic is very small, but contend that it is largely because of the inadequacy of the facilities, owing to the fact that the depot stands upon an embankment and between the main track and a spur in such a position that it is inaccessible for team traffic; that a large amount of necessary grading to make it accessible has never been completed. They further contend that the depot is not located in a proper place. They contend that the proper location for the depot is at the intersection of Warren Avenue with the Rock Island and Burlington railroads. They further admit that they do not expect any permanent facilities to be established during the period of the war. They also admit that it would not be economy to make further outlays of money in developing the facilities at the present location, if the new location suggested is io be given any consideration. The remonstrators waive the introduction of testimony as to the amount of traffic that would be handled at the station if adequate facilities were installed and lo - cated at a proper point, in consideration of the following stipulation.

M. Hall, attorney, and J. M. Bramlette, general manager. The city, by the city altorney and the city commission, having entered into a stipulation whereby it consented to the removal of said tracks, did not appear. The School Board was represented by N. Z. Snell and Professor Jesse H. Newlon. It developed at the hearing, and through conferences with In city commission and the Traction Company, that the city commission has let a contract for the resurfacing of South Tenth street, which is now in such a state of repair that it makes it absolutely necessary for the work to be done immediately. It developed further that it was necessary for the Traction Company to relay its tracks on South Tenth street in that portion of its lines lying on the streets which the city now proposes to resurface and that this must be done preparatory to resurfacing, an-1 that it will then be necessary for the Traction Company to join with the city in resurfacing the street. The Traction Company shows to the Commission that in relaying its - tracks it will be necessary to replace all those rails which prove to be in such a state of depreciation that will not justify their relaying, and that it does not have steel of that character on hand and that new steel cannot be purchased at the present time for less than $80.00 per ton: that such steel is available in the tracks that they now propose to abandon; that the tracks they now propose to abandon have been lying idle for a period of about three years. The School' Board, through its president, contends that the service to the High School is not adequate and that service should be established from O street by way of Twenty - sixth street to J, thence to the High School, in order that the school traffic may be more efficiently handled. After a careful consideration of the matter and an examination of the traffic studies prepared by the School Board, the Commission is of the opinion that at this time no extensions and betterments should be made to the Lincoln Traction Company's properties in order to render a more extended service to the High School. The time may come when it will be necessary to establish and maintain a cross-town service somewhere from the north to the south through the eastern portion of the city, thereby connecting College View, Normal, Bethany, University Place and Havelock by a more direct route than that which is now rendered through the down-town service. However, the Commission is </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 425 of the opinion that this phase of it is rather too remote at this time to be given any serious consideration, and that it is not economy to leave the tracks on Twenty-sixth street referred to in place, thereby deteriorat - ing from year to year. wli«n it is necessary to relay other portions of the company's tracks v &gt; ' ■ » .me character of steel, which the com - pany does not have on band. The Commission i&lt; &lt;u. of the opinion that the authority as prayed for should be grained and that the Traction Company should im - mediately proceed to take up the tracks above referred to and all facili - ties in connection therewith and use the materials for replacement or extension purposes. The Commission is further of the opinion that in the abandonment of the facilities referred to the streets should be repaired in adequate and suitable condition under the direction of the city commission and with the approval of the Railway Commission. The Commission is further of the opinion that the applicant should provide for amortization of the accounts on its books in accordance with the order and general policies of the Railway Commission in such nlat - ters and in accordance with the order herein provided. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the authority be, and the same is hereby, granted to the applicant herein to take up its tracks and remove all street car facilities located on N street from Twenty-fifth to Twenty-sixth and on Twenty-sixth from N to J, and that the applicant shall use the ma - terials, or such portion of them as necessary, in relaying its tracks on South Tenth street. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the applicant herein proceed forth - with to remove said facilities and join with the city in resurfacing that portion of South Tenth street which is now proposed to be resurfaced by the city. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the expense of removing the track herein abandoned and replacing the pavement shall be charged to depreciation account. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the cost of the line of street railway hereby authorized to be abandoned shall be computed on the basis of $24,000 per mile; that the amount so found less the salvage value of the property recovered shall be set up on the books of the company and charged to an account known as an amortization account of the Twenty-sixth street abandonment; that said amortization ac - count shall be credited by charging to operating income twenty per cent annually of the amount so found until the total amount is realized for said purposes.

NEBRASA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION T. L. HALL, Chairman Attest: T. A. BROWNE, Secretary. (Wilson, Commissioner, not sitting.) (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3647 In the Matter of the Application of the Chi - cago, Burlington A Qumcy Railroad Com - pany for Authority to Close Its Station at South Minden, Nebraska. Appearances: For Applicant— E. Bignell, Supt. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co For Respondent — L. C. Paulson, Atty. for Minden Milling Company. Mimlen. OPINION AND FINDINU WILSON, Commissioner: The applicant maintains two railroad stations within the corporate limits of Minden, Nebraska, located about one mile apart. The station which applicant asks permission to close came into its possession through the purchase of a line of railroad extending from Alma, Ne - braska, to Stromsburg, Nebraska, which purchase was subsequent to the establishment of applicant's main line from Omaha to Denver, pass - ing through Minden. The two lines of railroad are not physically connected and to so con - nect them would cost approximately $385,000. The sole reason assigned in support of the application is a shortage of agents and operators due to war conditions, and it is not sought to close the station beyond the time of the existence of the shortage. A full complement of such help is not anticipated, however, during the war. There is but one protest to the application, viz:, the Minden Milling company, which owns and operates a flouring mill located near the sta - tion of South Minden. Protestant's manager testified that the com - pany would be subjected to considerable inconvenience and expense if it had to transact all of its railroad business at the main line station one mile away, but on representation of applicant's superintendent at the hearing that the South Minden station would be kept open a reasonable length of time each day for the receiving and storing of less than ea - load merchandise and for the accommodation of passengers the protect was not pressed. </seg>
            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 427 Applicant showed that it is exceedingly short of its necessary com plement of agents and operators in the state and that it is using every possible means to recruit these forces to full strength. If the South Minden station is closed, as contemplated, the agent employed there would fill a vacancy elsewhere on the division. It was shown that the force of employes at the main line station was sufficient to transact all of applicant's business at Minden, and that while the public would be inconvenienced somewhat by the closing of the South Minden station, the carrier's service to the general government in assisting to carry on the war will be bettered by such action, and that is of first importance. The period during which the station may remain closed should not be longer than reasonable under the circumstances — longer than is neces - sary to a material increase in the labor supply, or within which such an increase is likely to occur ,as the closing is of a temporary nature only. The Commission finds, therefore, that the application to close the railroad station at South Minden, Nebraska, is reasonable and just for a time not to exceed one year from the effective date of this order, to - wit: September 15, 1918, provided the same is open for the reception and storage of less than carload merchandise for a reasonable time during week days; and provided, further, that the passenger waiting rooms of said station be opened and comfortably heated for a reasonable time prior to the departure of all trains. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company be, and the same is hereby, permitted to close its station at South Minden, Nebraska, for one year, beginning September 15, 1918, except for such time consecutively each day as is required to receive and deliver all less than carload merchandise received or tendered for shipment at said station, and except further that the passenger waiting rooms of said station shall be kept open • and comfortably heated for a reasonable period prior to the scheduled and actual departure of all trains.

Appearances: For Applicant— C. H. Wood, Mgr. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: Applicant herein has asked authority to increase rate for farm line service, metallic circuit, from $1.25 per month to $1.75 per month grosB with 25 cents discount if paid on or before the tenth of the month in which service is given, and to increase farm line business rate to $2.00 per month net; also, to make a charge of $2.50 for installation or moving phones. Hearing on this application was held in the office of the Commission on November 8. Notices of this hearing were sent to various persons in Valparaiso, but no appearances were entered. A petition had been filed by applicant, signed by a large maority of the subscribers af - fected by the application, agreeing to the increase, which fact may ac - count for lack of appearances. The company's financial statement was complicated by the fact that under contract it took care of the electric light business of Valparaiso, rented to that company space on many of its poles, maintained the lines and did the billing and collecting. Although the Commission in an order entered on Application 2207 directed the company to separate the accounts of the electric light company from the accounts of the tele - phone company, this separation was never properly made. The company has outstanding capital stock amounting to $28,600, which issues have been scrutinized by the Commission in former hear - ings and approved. It owes $4,000 on which seven per cent interest is paid, and $6,000 on which eight per cent interest is paid. The manager testified that all this borrowed money is represented in betterments and additions to the plant. U. G. Powell, chief accountant for the Commission, read into the record the corrected statement of earnings and disbursements with the electric business eliminated and credit given to the telephone company for the net earnings to that company from handling the electric light business. This corrected statement reads as follows: TELEPHONE EARNINGS FOR 1917 iubscribers' service 'oil commissions (iscellaneous earnings . '. 455.49 . 789.05 Total $7,983.54 </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 429 The Commission finds that this net surplus is wholly insufficient to pay a proper return on the investors' sacrifice in the plant and to set aside a proper depreciation reserve fund. The record shows that there are slightly fewer than 300 subscribers affected by the proposed application. The increases asked for would provide a gross additional return between $850 and $900 per annum, which added to the net surplus fund above would be about $1,300 out of which to pay dividends on the capital stock and to set aside deprecia - tion reserve. The Commission is of the opinion that until such time as the depreciation reserve is properly cared for by funds set aside, the company should be restricted to a dividend rate of not more than six per cent on the capital stock outstanding. The maintenance and deprecia - tion reserve together should be set aside by applicant company in amount not less than nine per cent of the cost of the plant. Allowance for this joint fund should be made before dividends are declared and paid. Action on the proposed charge for installation or moving will not be taken until conclusion of the controversy with the Postmaster General over installation charges promulgated by him different from those held reasonable by this Commission.

This matter came on for hearing before Commissioner Hall at Falls City on September 13. Practically no reasons were advanced why the applications should not be allowed, and good operating reasons were presented by applicant why flat rate service should be eliminated in the interest of the telephone-using public in general. Toll lines between the towns affected, both those owned by applicant company and adjacent exchanges with reciprocal relations, are owned by this applicant. It is proposed to withdraw these toll lines from the privilege of flat rate service and to put all service on .a per call basis. It is proposed also to cancel the 20-cent rate in effect between certain </seg>

The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application should be approved, same to be effective October 1, 1918. It is also of the opinion that if any subscribers have paid actual money in advance for added exchange privileges and the period for which payment was made has not yet elapsed, prorated adjustment should be made by the company either in cash or credit to the subscriber. This adjustment should not be made nor the privilege be extended beyond the effective date of this order to those subscribers who have merely paid annually in advance and thereby fiave received certain added exchange privilege:; without further consideration than an advance payment of regular rates. In the interest of more effective collections and for the purpose of reducing the cost of collections, the Commission will also approve gross and net rates with a spread of twenty-five cents per month for each class of service with discount of twenty-five cents for prompt payment of bills.

FINDING AND ORDER HALL, Commissioner This is an application by The Lincoln Traction Company for au - thority to increase its passenger fares. The applicant alleges that its gross revenues are insufficient to meet the operating expenses and fixed charges, thus leaving not only all dividends unpaid, but a portion of the interest on the bonds also unpaid. The Commission finds that beginning with the month of April. 1918. the gross revenues of the company from all sources has been insufficient to meet operating expenses, taxes and interest on the outstanding bonds. While the company has recently increased its rates for light and power, to take effect September 20. 1918. and there is some evidence that the gross revenue will be increased thereby, yet it is so problematical that definite conclusions cannot be based thereon. Following is a tabulation showing the results of operation from January 1, 1918. to August 1. 1918.: Net Taxes Gross Operating Operating and Net 1470,650.51 1371.038.16 $99,612.35 188,301.92 $11,810.43 Revenue Jan $ 84.993.00 Feb 73,288.05 March 68.063.31 April ... 63,579.45 May 62,192.89 June 59,288.10 July 59.245.71 Expenses $ 58.903.26 55.060.81 51,478.34 51,348.12 50,498.15 50,916.24 52,833.24 Income $26,089.74 18,227.24 16,584.97 12.231.33 11.694.74 8,371.86 6,412.47 Interest $13,348.73 13,763.70 12.407.52 12.238.16 12,218.79 12,153.13 12,171.89 Income $12,741.01 4,463.54 4,177.45 6.83 Cr. 524.05 Cr. 3,781.27 Cr.

            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 433 The operations for the month of August will probably result in a deficit of about $9,000. The growth in operating expenses is due to increased costs of fuel and materials of all kinds and increases in wages and salaries. During the present year three increases have been granted to trainmen: Two cents per hour on February 1st, three cents per hour on June 1st, and five cents per hour on August 1st. These increases were, in the opinion of the Commission, reasonable and necessary to enable the company to kamtsnr t, props? standard of service. la additiaa Vae*e- ba.v« Wan. an increase of 27% in shopmen's wages. 20% in linemen's wages, anti 3% in the salaries of office employes since January 1, 1918. There has been no increase in officers' salaries. It is the duty of the Commission to see that proper service is main - tained, and where the revenues have fallen to the danger point steps should be taken to insure adequate service. In a former application (No. 3066) an emergency was denned by the Commission as follows: "That condition in the affairs of a common carrier when the operating revenues are insufficient to operate and maintain the prop - erties of the carrier and to pay interest charges upon such of its securities as a default in payment of the charges thereon would lay the foundation for the appointment of a receiver of the company." Under the terms of this definition the Commission finds that an emergency now exists. In a decision rendered June 17, 1918, in the case above referred to, which is now pending in the Supreme Court, the Commission said: "We do not advocate the policy of allowing a depletion of the entire surplus reserves, and we are of the opinion that should the reserves continue to be reduced by reason of high cost of operation the Commission should take time by the forelock and raise the rates, but certainly the Commission should not raise the rates and place a greater burden upon the people until the company itself has done its full duty." The Commission still adheres to that position, but conditions have so radically changed since January 1, 1918, and the reserves referred to In the former order being unavailable, it becomes necessary for the Commission to provide for emergency rates in order to furnish adequate street car service. It should be mentioned that the former opinion was based on the operating revenues and the disbursements thereof down to January 1, 1918. The increased revenues resulting from the application of higher fares and higher rates for light and power should be used for the main - tenance of the property, operating expenses and interest on the bonded indebtedness. Whatever remains after paying these three items should be used to rehabilitate the properties of the company which are in a low operating condition. No part of the revenues of the company re - ceived while this order is is force should be used to pay dividends nor to make addition* or betterments. The expenditure of the funds in the rehabilitation of the property will be under the general direction of the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p432">434 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Commission also finds that proper depreciation reserve accounts have not been set up on the additions and betterments made to the com - pany's property since January 1, 1913; that six per cent per annum is a reasonable amount to charge against operating revenues for the con tinuous maintenance of the property as provided in the order herein entered.

FINDINGS AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: The application, filed September 30. 1918, states in substance that prior to August 1, 1918. applicant was engaged in furnishing telephone service in the state of Nebraska, with rates of charge filed with the Commission according to law; that at midnight of July 31. 1918. the Postmaster General of the United States took possession and control of applicant's lines and property by virtue of an act of Congress and the proclamation of the President of the United States, and that since that date the operation and management of said property has been conducted by the applicant for and on behalf of the Postmaster General; that the rates now charged for applicant's service are substantially the same as they were in the year 1908; that the prices of wages and of material and </seg>
            <seg id="p436">438 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT suppliei have greatly increased since the commencement of the war, and lhat it will be necessary to grant increases of wages at this time in the amount of 9406,000 per annum approximately in order to hold or obtain necessary employes; and hence, that the public service furnis'.o by the applicant cannot be supplied without a considerable increase in the lates. That application states further that it is made pursuant to an order of the Postmaster General, the new rates fixed by the Commission to be submitted to the Postmaster General for his approval before going into effect. The prayer is for an increase of 20% in all local service rates and an'increase of 25^ in all long distance toll rates, subject to the provision that where the proposed rate amounts to a sum not divisible by five the same shall be increased or decreased to the nearest figure so divisible; and for a postponement of the hour of day at which so-called night toll rates are applied, from 6:00 p. m. to 9:00 p. m. The city of Omaha alone among the municipalities affected by the matter, protested the application on the following grounds: (1) The Commission is without jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter; (2) the application does not state facts sufficient to entitle applicant to relief because of the necessity for submitting the action of the Commis - sion to the Postmaster General for his approval before the same can take effect; (3) that the applicant is not the real party in interest and that any deficit from operation at the present rates will be borne by the United States. The protest was argued to the Commission at the time of the hear ing and overruled. The application stated an emergency under the statute, consequently there was neither time nor necessity for a valuation of applicant's prop - erty. Applicant furnished for the record, however, a history of its capi - tal issues (except tor money borrowed) and dividends paid thereon from the organization of the company in 1882 to December 31, 1917; the cost of maintaining the property during the years 1908 to 1917, inclusive, the dividends paid upcn its stock, a statement of current revenues and ex - penses, a detailed statement of the increases in wages that were immi - nent, and much other data as to the inadequacy of the present rates. Applicant's balance statement for June 30, 1918, is as follows: ASSETS Physical property _ $12,913,153 nvestments 4,800,563 and deposits 84,805 Uills and accounts receivable, etc 865,559 Total $18,664,080 LIABILITIES Capital stock $ 9,200,000 3ills payable 5,343,035 3ther payables, etc _ 485,565 Reserves for depreciation 2,306,859 5urplus 1.328,621 Total _ $18,664,080 </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 439 A statement of revenues and expenses for twelve months the results in June, 1918, and charges against net earnings, is a based on follows: REV E NUES Exchange Toll Rent Miscellaneous 0,500.00 Total 131.08S.OO EXF h NSES Current maintenanc Traffic $ 60 782.496.00 Commercial General .660.00 104,652.00 208,776.00 229,356.00 Taxes Miscellaneous Total 174,292.00 Net earnings J 956.796.00 CHARGES AGAINST EARNINGS Depreciation reserve on basis of 8% of book valuf physical property less current maintenances ..

Applicant has already announced wage increases in the amounts reflected above. The reserves for depreciation shown in the balance statement appear large on first thought, but it was shown that they will be reduced over $800,000 by renewals in the exchanges located in Omaha now nearing completion. The balance in the account will then be about 11% only of the physical property account, which is not excessive in view of the present high level of prices. Applicant claims that in order to properly protect its property against depreciation it should be permitted to credit to depreciation re - serves, in addition to the cost of current maintenance, an account equal $2,211,852.(W 843,432.00 5,304.00 E INCREASES property... 24.750.0( </seg>
            <seg id="p438">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 440 to 6% per annum of its physical property accounts. The basis of such credits in the past has not been uniform, sometimes going above but more often much below 6%. In 1917 the expenditures for current main - tenance plus the credits to depreciation reserves amounted to 10.65% of the physical property accounts. Prior to the war the Commission considered that an amount equal to 8% of the cost of depreciable property in telephone plants was suf - ficient to cover both realized and unrealized depreciation. War prices induced the Commission to increase the percentage to 9% where the necessity therefor was fully demonstrated. No studies were offered in the instant matter dealing particularly with this subject, and considering the balance in depreciation reserves it does not appear that the applicant will be endangered by limiting the charges for maintenance and de - preciation to the basis heretofore followed by the Commission, at least until it is determined that the increase of rates herein provided for should be made permanent. The basis of applicant's charges to its depreciation reserves was specially considered by the Commission, viz., the cost of the property replaced rather than the cost of the property substituted therefor, even where the substitution is in kind. This results in a considerable portion of the cost of replacements being charged to the plant account during the present inflated price era. The property could remain exactly the same in kind and yet greatly appreciate in book value under this method, and it actually does so to the extent of the replacements. The appre - ciation becomes a capital charge, and capital securities are issued against it. But suppose prices drop considerably from their present level, as is confidently predicted. We will then have a property value below and out of proportion to the securities outstanding, thereby im - pairing the company's credit and its ability to furnish the service re - quired of it. It is argued that the relation between property value and capital could be restored by amortizing the excess capital, but that would place an unjust burden upon the rate payers of the period. The extra cost of maintaining the property occurred previously, and should have been borne by the patrons of that period. High incomes accom - pany high prices as a general rule, and those enjoying them should pay the full cost of what they consume. We are of the opinion that the better policy is to charge the depreciation reserves with the full cost of replacements made in kind, and where the replacements are not of that character that the basis of the charges should be the reproduction new value of the property displaced as of the time of the purchase of the property substituted therefor, the difference between that value and the cost of the property installed, if any, to be debited or credited to plant account according as said cost is above or below the reproduction new value. There is the further question of the surplus in the company's pos - session, amounting to $1,328,621, which is approximately 7%% of the company's assets. A surplus is necessary to every well conducted busl neu enterprise aa an Insurance against extraordinary losses and to make </seg>
            <seg id="p439">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 441 certain the payment of fixed charges and dividends. This is particularly true in public- service affairs, as the owner is under obligation to main - tain a good standard of service at all times and to extend the service within reasonable bounds. The necessity for a considerable surplus is well illustrated in applicant's situation at this time. It is now con - fronted with an annual prospective deficit of $545,000 and it is by no means certain that the increase of rates herein provided for is not in excess of what the traffic will bear. In fact, the increase granted is not enough to cover this deficit based upon the present volume of business, and the surplus may have to be drawn upon to meet obligations. The emergency now confronting applicant cannot therefore be met in any - considerable measure by the use of surplus funds. There is also little question in this case aa to the existence of a surplus in the property over and above that reflected in the surplus account. All of the capital stock outstanding, with the exception of $350,000 issued to the Bell Telephone company in 1883 and 1884 for certain territorial rights to the use of patent telephones, was issued and sold at par for money only, and the bills and accounts payable represent actual borrowings at 6% interest without discount. The patent rights were carried as an asset until 1912. when the account was charged to surplus. And there is no question of excessive dividends paid to stockholders in the past. It was shown of record that the average annual dividend rate of the company during its history is 5.65%, and the inclusion of the 1350,000 representing patent rights and charged to surplus, if that be proper, would not materially increase this rate of return. Applicant does not seek higher rates in order to increase either the rate of interest paid upon borrowed capital (6%) or the rate of dividend paid during recent years upon its stock (7%). Neither is it proposed that the salaries of any officer or employe now receiving more than $1,800 per annum be increased. The anticipated increase in revenues under the proposed rates was estimated at $680,000 per annum. This is in excess of the prospective deficit, and it does not take into consideration the growing value of business under way. The Commission is also in considerable doubt as to the reasonableness of the present relation between local and long dis - tance rates, and inclines to the belief that the local rates are higher than they should be compared with the toll rates. A ten per cent in - crease of local exchange rates and a 25% increase of toll rates will yield approximately $432,000 additional revenue on the basis of the present volume of business. Protected as applicant is by a considerable surplus fund, these increases are considered sufficient for the temporary needs. If not, the deficit can bo made good upon application when actual results are known. Applicant should, however, be required to justify the toll rates within a reasonable time in order to assess the costs of the ser - vice equitably as between local and long distance patrons. We find therefore that an emergency exists in the premises, an ! that increases over the present rates of ten per cent for local exchange </seg>

            <seg id="p442">444 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION NO. 3701 In the Matter of the Application of the Lin - coln Telephone A Telegraph Company for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearances: For applicant, F. H. Woods, president; L. E. Hurtz, general manager. OPINION AND FINDING WILSON, Commissioner Applicant owns and operates a telephone system consisting of 10a local exchanges located in the southeastern quarter of Nebraska, and toll lines connecting the exchanges with each other and with toll lines owned by other companies touching the boundaries of the territories. Service rates have been established at many of the exchanges by the Commission in the past upon separate application and hearing. No hearing hae ever been held as to toll rates and they have remained su stantially as they were in 1907 when the Commission was created. Applicant alleges that it is confronted everywhere on its system with an extraordinary increase in the cost of labor and material used in the service. Many employes are quitting and taking other employment at materially higher wages than applicant is able to pay, and materials needed for repairs and replacement have increased in price from thirty to one hundred per cent. A twenty per cent increase of wages is deemed imperative at this time amounting in the aggregate to $150,000 per annum and a greater increase may be necessary in the near future. The present cost of materials is not stated but it may safely be said on the record to amount to $100,000 per annum. An increase of $40,000 in taxes is also anticipated. Applicant also alleges that it has no surplus accumulated in past years out of which to meet this increased cost and that its past return to the bond and stockholders has been unreasonably low — 5.6% per annum. It does not ask for a greater return and says on the other hand that it will be content with that heretofore received, notwithstanding the fall in purchasing power of the dollar. It does ask for reimburse - ment of the extra costs above set forth, which, if the allegations be true, is no more than its due. The means of securing the necessary additional revenue proposed by applicant is (1) an advance of certain local service rates at sixty-six of the company's exchanges to the standard of such rates prevailing elsewhere on the system, and (2) an advance of toll rates amounting to 25%. approximately. Postponement of the hour at which night toll rates are effective from 6:00 p. m. to 9:00 p. m. is also requested. The matter was set for hearing at an early date, — three days only after the filing of the application, — because of the imminent danger to the service shown by the application. The hearing was ex parte. In fact, no one appeared or had time to prepare and appear in opposition to the application. The Commission, however, called for and secured a </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 445 complete financial showing of applicant's business during the greater part of its history, and examined applicant's witnesses at length as to the grounds of the application. The record shows that a substantial advance in the wages paid by applicant is required and that it should be made immediately. The employes outside of the executive force number 1,206 at the present time. From one hundred to two hundred additional employes are neces sary to the efficient operation of the system. The male employes num - ber 483 and receive an average wage of $78.84 a month. Female em - ployes number 733 and are paid an average wage of |35.65 a month. All of them are more or less skilled and the necessity for keeping them in the service if possible is manifest. It was shown that common labor is better rewarded. It is being paid from forty to fifty cents an hour for male labor and fifty dollars to eighty-five dollars a month lor female labor. One hundred and eighty of applicant's male employes have entered military service since the beginning of the war and scores of employes have taken other employment at much higher wages. The Commission is of the opinion that a 20% increase of the exist - ing wages is necessary. If the war continues much longer a greater ad - vance will doubtless have to be made. Applicant is now paying wages to these employes in the amount of $776,450 a year. Twenty per cent of this amount is $153,491.20. and represents the additional future cost per annum on this account. The normal requirement as to materials for repairs and replace - ments before the war is shown of record only by deduction, and that indefinitely, but they did not in reason amount to less than $200,000 a year. The record shows an average increase in the cost of such ma - terial of about 50%. One hundred thousand dollars therefore represents the advance in costs per annum of the material necessary to keep the system in good repair. Applicant also anticipates an increase of $40,000 per annum in its taxes under the federal revenue bill, now pending in the Congress. The federal government has recently taken possession of applicant's systei. and all other telephone systems in the country, and is entering into con - tracts as to the compensation to be paid the owners of such companies for the use of their properties. The contracts so far entered into pro - vide that all taxes shall be charged against the revenue. Common knowledge of the requirements of the federal revenue bill referred to is corroborative of applicant's anticipation as to an increase, and this addi - tional burden, though in the nature of a contingency, is entitled tc consideration. We have therefore a definitely ascertained increase in the annual cosU of applicant's business of $250,000. at least, with the probable addition of $40,000. Applicant is entitled to reimbursement of these costs, unless it has a surplus sufficient to cover them in reason. According to applicant's books of account, its assets and liabilities on July 1. 1918, were as follows, to-wit; </seg>

Where** It hft.s been debited With $1,731,152.97 ex pended for replacementii of worn-out equipment and for consolidation of purchased plants with original properties. The credit balance now in this account came about entirely from debits to "Corporate Surplus Unappropriated" account In the sum of $674,020.55, surplus credit bal - ances of properties purchased in the sum of $105,469.46 and credits from minor sources aggregating $22,085.85, with corresponding credits to the depreciation reserve account; and there never was at any time any corporate surplus measured by cash investments or actual values oi applicant's properties, with the possible exception of $118,425.40 shown as a credit balance of the account on February 1, 1912. The history of the "Corporate Surplus Unappropriated" account is substantially as follows: In 1912 applicant purchased all of the ex - change and toll property of the Nebraska Telephone Company located in the territory now covered by its system. After taking possession of the property, applicant made an inventory and reproduction new value of all of its property and arrived at a figure in excess of the cost to it of the property of $1,137,948.87, which it credited to "Corporate Surplus Unappropriated" account, resulting in a credit balance of $1,256,374.27 in the account. Subsequent credits are as follows: $60,585.09 from rev - enues; $32,125.09 from revenues of purchased properties; and $30.269.8J from miscellaneous sources. Debits to the account are as follows: To "Reserve for Accrued Depreciation" account, $674,020.55; to dividends to stockholders. $153,982.36; to taxes, $11,952.07; to employes' benefits, $10,000; to bonds and stock redeemed, $30,936.85; to losses incurred in the sale of property measured by its book value, $21,986.65; to miscel - laneous items, $32,439.04. The balance now in the fund is $454,036.48. It is, therefore, apparent that the balance in the account and the balance in "Reserve for Accrued Depreciation" account of $553,116.30, also, came altogether from the artificial surplus created by the valuation. There is therefore no actual surplus to be drawn upon to meet the increased costs of operation which now concern applicant. Current rev - enues must be looked to for all requirements. The costs of operation, current repairs and taxes are definitely shown from February 1, 1912, to July 31, 1918, by the record. The costs of replacements, however, are mixed with the cost of consolidating purchased properties with original properties, formerly competing. They were all charged to "Reserve for Accrued Depreciation" and no separation is shown of record. The pur - pose of a depreciation reserve is solely to replace worn-out property in kind. The use of such reserves for consolidating properties is therefore illegal. Consolidation costs should come out of capital the same as plan' costs, as the presumption is that they were taken into account in fixing the purchase prices of properties acquired under those circumstances. The practice of the applicant in this respect is therefore condemned and the order herein will provide against its continuance. The Commission has always treated maintenance and depreciation (repairs and replacements) together because of the practicability of such </seg>
            <seg id="p446">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 448 treatment by utility companies themselves, the difficulties inherent iu separate treatment, and the insuperable obstacles in the way of dis - tinguishing between maintenance and depreciation by regulatory bodies. The Commission has made a number of studies of the cost of mainte - nance and depreciation of telephone properties which show an average annual expense for the period of time covering the life of such proper - ties of 8%. The percentage during the early years of the property is from three to five per cent and in the later years from nine to eleven per cent, with an average of 8% as indicated. Applicant's expenditures for consolidating purchased properties with those formerly owned by it were made largely in the years 1913, 1914 and 1915, and is reflected in the following relation between its expenditures for repairs, replacements and consolidation and its plant values from the beginning in 1912 down to date, to-wit: 1912, 4.25%; 1913, 8.63%; 1914, 8.82%; 1915, 7.79%; 1916, 7.23%; 1917, 7.42%; 1918, 7.8%. Only the percentages of the last three years may safely be taken as a measure of applicant's needs for maintenance and deprecia - tion and they are vitiated somewhat by the inclusion of consolidation costs. Seven per cent per annum for the years 1916 and 1917 is doubt - less a fair measure of those needs, considering the age of the property. Practically no expenditures for consolidation have been made so far in 1918 and the 7.8% shown for that period reflects to a degree the in - creasing costs with which we are confronted. The record shows that applicant has already increased wages this year in the sum of $50,000. The further increase of wages now found necessary calls for an increase in the amount allowed for maintenance and depreciation. One per cent upon the book value of the plant amounts to $72,000 and the wages paid may be said to be divided equally between those required in operation and those required in making repairs and replacements. The Commis - sion finds, therefore, that 9% of the book value of the plant should be allowed for maintenance and depreciation. The Commission noted during the hearing that the applicant was using a basis for charges to the depreciation reserve fund on account of replacements which gave results at variance with the purpose of the fund, as the Commission views that purpose. The basis used is the cost to applicant (or to its predecessor in the case of purchased plants) of the particular item of equipment replaced, the cost being estimated for the most part because of incomplete records as to original costs. The difference between this cost and the company's expenditure in making the replacement is debited or credited to plant account, according as it is above or below the cost of the property displaced. The result is a fluctuating plant account compared with the extent of property and service and a corresponding fluctuation in the amount of return due applicant on the value of property basis. It also introduces a highly disturbing factor in physical valuation proceedings as it is im - possible for the engineer to inventory replacements separately from the original property yet in place or according to time of installment. The basis is also not in accordance with the purpose of a depreciation re- </seg>
            <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 449 serve fund which is to replace worn-out or obsolete property in kind re - gardless of the cost. Credits are made to this fund from revenues with the idea of fully maintaining the plant in good operating condition. Permanence of service can be secured in no other way, as private capi - tal with which to make repairs cannot be secured where the capital account is already full. At least capital cannot be secured for that purpose where the facts are known. The law also recognizes the obli - gation of maintaining the property ahead of owner's return, as a public utility is not permitted to pay dividends without making ample pro - vision for this purpose. Applicant will, therefore, be required to charge to its depreciation reserve fund the entire cost of replacements in kind. Where not made in kind the charge shall be the estimated present cost, or reproduction new value of the property displaced, and the difference between that cost and the cost of the property installed shall be debited or credited to plant account as the case may be, due allowance being made for all salvage values in the displaced property. Applicant states that the return to its bond and stockholders in the past is a satisfactory measure of future return. This return is figured at 5% upon its bond and preferred stock and 7% upon its common stock. All of these securities have been issued under authority of the Commission, and while the Commission is not advised as to the judicious - ness of the investment of their proceeds in all respects, the emergency presented by the application does not permit of an inquiry along this line. The Commission also takes cognizance of the fact that the com - pensation contracts being entered into between the federal government and telephone companies provide for the payment of interest and divi - dend charges as in the past. It finds, therefore, for the purposes of this case that the return so calculated is reasonable. The annual financial requirements of the applicant are, therefore, estimated as follows, to-wit: The actual expenditures for above purposes in 1917 amounted to $1,467,859.97, approximately $330,000 less than the estimate for the com - ing year. The increased expenses over 1917, previously noted, to-wit: wage advance already made, $50,000; wage advance to be made, $153, - 491.20; materials, $100,000; and taxes, $40,000; totaling $343,491.20, are therefore seen to be included in the budget substantially, and actual ex- Operation based on cost of first seven months of 1918, multiplied by 120% $ 625,957.92 Maintenance and depreciation based on 9', of book value of plant 638,102.60 Taxes based on 1917 taxes of $78,432 plus $40,000 118,432.00 Telephone plant and office rental 11,278.32 Interest of $1,200,000 of bonds at 5% 60,000.00 Dividends on $3,957,456 of preferred stock at 5% 197,972.80 Dividends on $2,005,795 of common stock at 7% 140,405.65 Miscellaneous interest and amortization requirements 5,429.04 Total $1,797,478.33 </seg>
            <seg id="p448">450 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT paaiHures will doubtlcttK fall below the budget under the new method of charging consolidation costs to capital. It must be understood, however, that consolidation costs may not be charged to capital in cases where it will result in a greater charge to capital than the value of the plant. Application should be made to the Commission in such cases for a valuation of the property after consolida - tion and a determination of the amount properly chargeable to capital, and should a deficit arise in a proceeding of that character it would appear that it should be charged to common stock dividend account, as an injudicious investment. Applicant's proposal to increase part only of its local service rates is open to objection, if the new rates are to be permanent. The applica - tion and showing are predicated upon the entire business of the com - pany and not upon the business of the particular exchanges at which the increased rates are to apply. It may be that an accounting study of the business done by these exchanges in the past would show a surplus at some of them sufficient to absorb the increased cost now about to ensue, in which case an advance in rates would not be justified. The fact, however, that the rates affected are below those found by the Commis - sion to be reasonable for similar services elsewhere on the system raises the presumption in an emergency proceeding that the rates should be raised to normal, pending a full inquiry as to the business of the ex - change. The amount of funds represented by the proposed increase are required in addition to the funds likely to accrue from the pro - posed advance in toll rates, and it would be unfair in a proceeding of this nature to raise the local service rates that are already high com - pared with the subnormal rates without placing all rates on an equality. Credit will be given to each exchange separately for all of the revenues accruing from its rates including a reasonable percentage of the toll revenues collected by it, and the order increasing the rates will not re - lieve applicant of the duty of establishing the reasonableness of each of the rates in subsequent proceedings. In fact, applicant should do so at the earliest opportunity and the order herein will fix a time for such action. The rates effected are described in the order only, for brevity. As - suming that there will be no loss of subscribers under the new rates, the increase will provide $107,940 of additional revenue per annum. Appli - cant anticipates some loss in business ; however, not so much from the increase of monthly rates as from the service connection charges estab - lished by the federal government. The record shows that approximately one-third of the people now applying for regular telephone service are refusing to take it on account of the service connection charges. The average term of a telephone subscriber in the city of Lincoln was found upon study to be somewhat over five years and the average rate is $27.00 per annum, or $135.00 for five years. Applying the service con - nection charges to the whole number of Lincoln subscribers results in an average of such charges of $8.00 per subscriber. Two such charges </seg>
            <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 451 gained, or $16.00, compared with $135.00, represents the loss in groi the federal government. one loss of rates for five years, or 3 revenue on account of the action of The record shows further that with practically no service connec - tion charges in force applicant secured 2,615 new subscribers in Lincoln in 1917 and lost 2,006. If one-third of the new subscribers had refused the service, only 1,743 new subscribers would have been gained as against 2,006 lost. The net loss of 263 subscribers represents 2.2% of the 11,900 subscribers connected with the exchange. True, the loss is not likely to continue in such proportions. The public in time will doubtless get accustomed to the new rates, but the^ result so far may well occasion grave concern on the part of those charged with the admin - istration of the property. The increase of 257c in toll rates applied for will yield $119,426.04, assuming that the volume of toll business done during the first seven months of 1918 will continue. There is little reason for a decline in toll business, as the new rates do not appear to be excessive from the standpoint of the value of the service in this time of high prices, and long distance communications are usually made regardless of cost. Adding these estimated increases in exchange and toll revenues to the receipts from those sources for the first seven months of 1918, the - oretically extended to cover a full year and including sundry revenues, gives the following estimate of applicant's annual revenues under the proposed schedule, to-wit: This is $80,000 more than the estimated requirements, or about 4%% of the budget, which is not excessive considering the fluctuating character of revenues and expenses in a year's time. No greater return will be permitted to inure to bond and stockholders by reason of the increase and the order herein will so provide. The increase of rates will also be limited to six months from the effective date of the order, subject to continuation by the Commission on due proof of the necessity. Monthly reports of revenues and expenses, including appropriations to the depreciation reserve fund and expenditures on that account, will be required, so as to enable the Commission to keep in touch with the results of the increase. Applicant also proposes to discontinue the rates for purely local service at the Havelock, University Place and College View exchanges and substitute the Lincoln zone rates and service therefor. The sub - scribers availing themselves of these local services are comparatively few in number and consist largely of those served by party lines, which also furnish zone service. The change is in harmony with the principle Exchange revenues ($107,940 increased revenues, plus $1,140,420 old revenue) $1,248,360.00 Toll revenues ($119,426 increased revenue, plus $477,704 old revenue) 597,130.00 Sundry revenues (no increase) 32.628.0U 0 Total . .$1,878,118.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p450">452 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT of regulation which dispenses with classes of service that are not in considerable demand, and the impossibility of effectively policing twc classes of service on a single wire, so that only those who pay for zone service receive it, is conclusive as to the wisdom of abolishing the lim - ited service. The Commission finds, therefore, that the discontinuance of rates for purely local service in the cities of Havelock, University Place and College View, and the substitution of Lincoln zone rates and service therefor, is reasonable and should be allowed. Applicant showed in support of its request to postpone the hour at which night toll rates go into effect from 6:00 p. m. to 9:00 p. m. that the toll lines are used during the intervening hours to a greater extent and more toll operators are required at that time than any other similar period during the day. This is due to the 50% reduction from day rates (with a minimum of twenty-five cents) then in effect. The traffic done consists mainly of business communications legitimately carrying day rates. This abnormal traffic during these hours is especially burden - some to the operators. It compels them to work night hours and to go to their homes in the dark during much of the year. It also prevents their going to evening entertainments and meetings and is one of the objections to entering the employment. The change will affect only a trifle over 30% of the messages, as nearly 70% of the traffic carries rates of from ten to twenty-five cents a message only. An additional 17% of all messages carry rates of from thirty to forty cents each. It was also shown that 9:00 p. m. is quite the uniform hour for night rates going into effect throughout the country and that it is the rule in all of the states adjacent to Nebraska, except - ing Kansas. The Commission finds, therefore, that the request is rea - sonable and the order will provide for the postponement of the hour at which night toll rates go into effect from 6:00 p. m. to 9:00 p. m.

            <seg id="p462">464 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT Prior to the filing of this application, numerous conferences were held between the officers of the street railway company and the Com - mission and between John L. Kennedy, fuel administrator of Nebraska, and the Commission. The fuel administrator of the federal government has urgently recommended the skip-stop plan in operating street railway companies for conservation of fuel and labor, and it was on the initiative of Mr. Kennedy that this matter was taken up with the Commission. Conferences were held in Omaha, attended by Mayor Smith, officers of the street railway company, and John L. Kennedy, fuel administrator of Nebraska, at which the skip-stop plan for cars known as the Farnam, Harney, and Dodge street lines was worked out, and agreed to by all concerned. This plan is set forth in a blue print attached to the appli - cation. It represents a considerable modification from the original recommended by the federal fuel administrator. For the Nebraska fuel administration Mr. John L. Kennedy has filed with the Commission a statement of approval of the application, and for and in behalf of the city of Omaha, Mayor Ed. P. Smith has done likewise. The Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the application should be approved as a war time measure for temporary use only. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company be. and it hereby is, authorized to publish and make effective on October 13, 1918, skip-stop plan of operating cars on the so-called Farnam street, Harney street, and Dodge street lines of applicant company within the city of Omaha, as per the plan set forth in blue print attached to the application.

            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 465 APPLICATION NO. 3705 In the Matter of the Application of the Pali - sade Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission Applicant herein asks authority to increase telephone rates on its exchange at Palisade. Nebraska, to $2.00 per month for business sta - tions, $1.50 per month for residence and company owned farm stations, and to 50c per month for switching independent lines. The rates now charged are $1.50 per month for business stations, $1.00 per month for residence and farm stations, and 35c per station per switched line. In support of this application applicant shows that in sixteen months ending October 1, 1918, the total expense for operating the company, plus maintenance and a small amount of new construction, was. .$4, 130.80 total revenues 4,357.00 leaving a net profit of 226.20 The rates now being charged were authorized by the Commission after a hearing, order having been issued in April, 1917. It was then found that the present rates under the conditions at the time the hearing was held would provide earnings slightly less than seven per cent on the valuation of $4,000, this being the amount paid for the prop - erty by the applicant. The amount of $4,000 was taken as the proper basis for earning for the reason that no proper inventory had been made of the properties and no adequate history of the development of the property was obtainable. Conditions since this hearing have changed. The company has been compelled to increase operators' wages $240 a year, the manager $300 a year for being superintendent and lineman, office rent $48 per year, and incidental expenses in an amount which the Commission considers not excessive at twenty per cent increase. Here are increased expenses amounting to $640 per year, exclusive of increased cost of materials for maintenance and repairs The rates proposed would yield an increase in gross earnings of almost $1,000 per annum The showing for sixteen months made by applicant indicates that an excessive amount was spent for maintenance materials and mainte nance in that approximately sixteen per cent on the minimum value ol the plant was used for maintenance exclusive of lineman's salary. This is considerably in excess of normal allowance and must be taken into account when considering what the present rates would do. It appears fair to assume that the cost of this abnormal maintenance will be suf - ficient even at increased prices to do a normal amount of maintenance. Hence, no extra allowance need be considered (or the Increased cost of </seg>

An increase of twenty-five cents per month on all classes of phone? owned by applicant company, an inc/ease of ten cents per month oa thirteen phones where the company owns only the instruments, and an increase of ten cents per month on the independent phones of the inde - pendent &gt;-ompanies switched would produce a maximum return to the Lompan(V of $667.00 additional to the present revenues. This the Com - missini considers adequate at the present time to take care of the in - crane in the cost of operation, increase in prices of maintenance ma - terials and maintenance, labor, and proper dividends on the amount heretofore found subject to the payment of dividends, namely $4,000. Applicant paid $5,800 for the property, but until applicant makes a showing to the Commission that this is a proper value on which divi - dends should be paid, permission will not be granted to increase divi - dends on a value beyond that fixed in the order dated March 5, 1917. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Palisade Telephone company be, and it hereby is, authorized to publish and collect from and after December 1. 1918, the following rates and charges for telephone service connected to its exchange: Business stations, where subscribers own telephone $1.75 per month in advance Business stations, where company owns instruments 2.00 per month in advance Residence stations, where subscribers own instruments 1.25 per month in advance Residence stations, where company owns instruments 1.50 per month in advance Farm subscribers, where subscribers own instruments _ 1.25 per month in advance Farm subscribers, where company owns instruments 1.50 per month in advance For switching farm lines, where com - pany owns instruments 70 per mo. payable quar - terly in advance For switching, where company owns none of the property 45 per mo. payable quar - terly in advance IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall pay from the gross receipts collected under these rates all proper operating expenses, gen - eral expenses, insurance, taxes, losses and damages, and dividends of not to exceed seven per cent on a valuation of $4,00&lt;V, and shall provide a fund of not less than nine per cent of the value of the property for maintenance and depreciation reserve.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3706 In the Matter of the Application of the Bert - rand Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates. FINDING AND OPINION WILSON, Commissioner: Applicant owns and operates a telephone system located in the vil - lage of Bertrand, Nebraska, and vicinity, it serves 127 urban sub - scribers and 110 farm subset ibers. It also furnishes switching service for 129 telephone users residing «n the vicinity of the village who own their own facilities. with additional rates for desk and extension sets The applicant asks for an increase of twenty-five cents per month in each of the rates. Applicant offers to give day and night service If the application is granted, and 129 subscribers petitioned in support of the application. No protests were filed and no hearing was held. Applicant was before the Commission in 1913 praying for an in - crease of rates. A hearing was held at that time at which an inventory and valuation of the property made by the Commission's engineers was received in evidence. The record in that matter also shows that the Commission's acountant made an investigation of applicant's books of account and reported that the books amounted only to a cash account, and that it was impossible to find the cost of construction of the plant or the owner's investment. Authority was given to increase business rates fifty cents per month and to make an additional charge of twenty - five cents per month for desk sets, the Commission basing its decision on the valuation of the property and the earnings and expenses for the year 1911. Applicant was ordered further to set aside from revenues for maintenance and depreciation purposes an amount equal to eight per cent of the value of its depreciable property, or $1,328 per annum. T.

It is impossible to determine the exact amount belonging to that fund because applicant has failed to set aside monthly the amount designated for that purpose. This amount may be approximated at $500 based upon the expenditures for mainte- nance above shown. In the 1913 case the Commission found the present value of the property to be $13,624.73, and the Commission directed the applicant to enter that amount upon its books as plant assets. The amount of that item on December 31, 1917, was shown to be $13,824.78. The Commission found inferentially in the 1913 case that a return of 7.6 per cent per annum on the value of the property was pot exces- sive. Considering all of the circumstances relating to applicant's prop- erty, including its size, location, prevailing interest rates in the vicinity and the excellence of the service rendered, the Commission now finds that a return of 8 per cent per annum since January 1, 1913, is reason- able. Applying this rate to the value of the property found in 1913, gives a total return due to the owner for the five years ending Decem- ber 31, 1917, of $5,449.91. The dividends paid during the five years amount to $11,199.08, or $5,649.17 in excess of the return due applicant. Eight per cent per annum on the book value of the plant (which value has increased only $200 since the 1913 value) amounts to $1,105.98. Applicant has, therefore, already received the return due it for five years in advance and is not entitled to an allowance for that purpose in its rates. </seg>
            <seg id="p467">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 469 The Commission has before it applicant's annual report for the calendar year ending December 31, 1917, which shows a net income for the year of $2,370.44. From this amount should be deducted 1146.40 as the unexpended balance of the amount that should have been set aside for maintenance and depreciation. This leaves $2,224.04 net income for the year, which is greatly in excess of applicant's claim of increased costs of the service at this time. It is therefore evident that the appli - cation for an increase of rates sTiould be denied. The denial of the application, however, should not relieve the appli - cant from the obligation of providing the best and most complete service possible from its revenues and the Commission finds that applicant should provide continuous day and night service. There is still another reason why the application should be denied. Applicant has failed to set aside for maintenance and depreciation from its revenues the amount prescribed by the Commission in its 1913 order, namely, $110.66 monthly. Applicant has apparently expended for this purpose about $100 monthly but the fund has not been created and appli - cant's reports do not show the unexpended balance in the fund. An applicant who violates a specific order of the Commission should not be heard to invoke its powers. Commissions correspond in a sense to the equity courts and it is a fundamental principle of equity that "he who seeks equity must do equity." The Commission is convinced, however, that the allowance for main - tenance and depreciation made in its 1913 order is insufficient to meet the increase in costs of labor and materials since that time. The Com - mission found a reproduction new value of the plant in 1913 of $18,886.50. Apparently $200 worth of property has been added to the plant since that time, making a reproduction new value as of this time of $19,086.50. The allowance for maintenance and depreciation should be based on re - production new value, inasmuch as labor and materials for maintaining and replacing the property must be purchased at current prices. The Commission has found in several telephone rate cases before it during the current year, which involved plants of similar size to the one under review, that the requirements for maintenance and depre - ciation amounted to 9 per cent per annum of the reproduction new value of the properties. Applying this percentage to the reproduction new value in this case gives $1,717.79, or $143.15 per month. The Commis - sion finds that this amount should be set aside for maintenance and depreciation. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the application of the Bertrand Telephone company for authority to increase its rates be and the aame is hereby denied. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no dividends or return shall accrue to applicant on account of property in place on December 31, 1917, valued at $13,824.78, for five years on and after January 1, 1918, and that if any dividends have been paid during 1918, that the same shall </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3712 In the Matter of the Application of the Thed - ford Telephone Company for Authority to Publish Rates on its Exchange at Thed - ford, Nebraska. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: Applicant herein asks authority to publish a rate of $2.00 per month for business telephone, $1.50 per month for residence and farm line service. It also asks authority to make a charge on non-subscribers and an "other line" charge on toll calls received at that point. Applicant has at present six business subscribers and forty other subscribers. It has been authorized by the Commission to sell stock to secure funds with which to improve and extend its plant. At the pres - ent time it has a gross revenue of $72, exclusive of toll commissions and toll earnings, which will not be heavy. The Commission considers these rates the minimum rates on which this company can operate. Following previous rulings where the Commission found a charge of ten cents per call to non-subscribers using the local exchanges not unreasonable, the Commission will authorize the collection of such charge. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, T. L. HALL, Chairman. Attest: T. A. BROWNE, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3730 In the Matter of the Application of the Bas - sett-Springview Telephone Company for In - crease in Telephone Rates. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: Applicant herein has asked authority of the Commission to increase its present toll and exchange rates twenty-five per cent to meet condi - tions of operation and maintenance at the present time. Besides the advances in toll rates, the rates proposed would be as follows: Business Residence $2.50 per month 1.55 per month Fam service 1.55 per month The total revenue of applicant Switching charges company in the year 1916 was $2,545, 5.00 per annum and in 1917, $3,652. A detailed statement for the first nine months of 1918 indicates that the total revenue for the calendar year will be ap proximatcly $3,737. Of this, toll earnings are about |1,200 The increases pioposed will add $30&lt;i to the loll revenue if business continues at the present rate, and $823 to the subscribers' rentals and switching service. These tigures are based on eighty switched sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p470">472 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT time to time. Thus the maximum revenue which might be secured from the proposed rates would be $4,860. There are many discrepancies in the annual reports of this company, but in the main they show a lack of dividends paid, a very small amount of new construction done, and in the years 1916 and 1917 practically no net surplus. Detailed statement of applicant for nine months of 1918 shows total expenditures of $2,726.85. This includes a $5.00 donation to the Red Cross, which should be eliminated, and possibly a small amount of new construction. The capital stock of the company has for years stood at $8,012.50. par value of shares $12.50. Applicant estimates the property value at $10,000. The Commission has no data on which to reach a conclusion as to this, but in so far as the records of the company disclose, the capital stock was all paid for in cash, and while it is evident a con - siderable amount of new property has been built out of rates, this new property in all events did not represent any more than the deferred dividends. Applicant has not taken care of depreciation reserve be - cause of lack of revenue. Some vouohers were issued for dividends in amount of $1,163, but the dividends were never paid and apparently the account is carried as accounts payable. If any interest was paid &lt;■ • these accounts payable the record and annual reports do not disclose it. During the first nine months of 1918 the operators were paid $312.00. Applicant says that it will be necessary to pay operators at the rate of $600 per year. This is not out of line with the experience of other com - panies. As manager and lineman, C. W. Coryell has received $75.00 per month and insists that he should have $100.00 per month. The Com - mission considers this a reasonable allowance. The secretary, however, has been paid at the rate of $300 a year. The records of a previous hearing indicate that the secretary does very little. The Commission considers it poor practice to carry anyone on the salary list in order that indirectly a return on investment may be secured, and it was recommended that this salary be eliminated. The Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that $100 a month should be paid for general office salaries and lineman's wages, and no more. This does not include the pay of operators or extra help on the lines. After all maintenance materials and maintenance labor have been eliminated the operating expenses at present, according to applicant's showing, are $1,357 per annum; general expenses, exclusive of manager and secretary, $230 per annum. Manager and lineman should be paid annually $1,200. When allowance is made for an increase in operators' wages of $300 per annum, and dividends on the outstanding stock at 8% and a depreciation reserve of 6% on the original cost of the plant, fig ured in this case at $10,000. there will remain from the total gross earn - ings approximately $600 for materials and for interest on the outstand - ing indebtedness. Applicant is manager and, for the most part, lineman. It will be a condition of this order that hereafter be separate the salary paid (or manager and lineman and to charge to general expenses such proportion </seg>

All repairs and replacements and the labor in connection there - with should be charged to maintenance and depreciation reserve. Wherever new construction in the way of additions or betterments it installed this should be carefully separated from maintenance and be carried on the books and reported to the Commission as new construc - tion. Additions and betterments are not proper charges against the revenues of the company, but are capital charges and should be repre - sented by stock or borrowed money. The Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that applicant should be allowed to increase telephone rates approximately 25%, but such increases to be subject to conditions as set forth in the order below. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com mission that, effective December 1, 1918, the Basse tt-Springview Tele phone company be, and it hereby is, for telephone service rates as follows: authorized to charge and collect Business Residence $2.50 per month 1.55 per month 1.55 per month . 5.00 per annum Farm service Switching charges IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that toll rates of applicant company shall from and after December 1, 1918, until further order of the Com- mission, be advanced 257c over present toll rates, and that where toll service is asked for from a coin-box station the next higher multiple of five cents will be charged. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall first pay from Its gross earnings all proper operating expenses and general expenses, sub - ject to a limitation of $100 per month for lineman and general salaries; shall set aside for maintenance and depreciation reserve not less than 12% of the book value of the property per annum and pay therefrom all charges for repairs and replacements and labor in connection therewith and the proper proportion of the lineman's salary devoted to repairs and replacements; shall pay all interest, taxes, heat, light, power and rent bills, interest on indebtedness, claims for loss and damage, if any; and, after all these charges have been met, and not until then, may pay out of remaining surplus funds not to exceed 8% dividends on outstanding stock. Because of evident poor condition of property of applicant the maintenance and depreciation fund is fixed at 12%, but upon showing by applicant in future that the lines are in good condition this amount will be reduced.

Zl'Mi In the Matter of the Application of trie Wyo - ming S. Nebraska Telephone Company for Authority to Increase its Toll and Exchange Rates. Appearances: For applicant, J. A. C. Kennedy, attorney; Eben D Warner, vice-president and general manager. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant owns and operates a telephone system in the extreme northwest portion of Nebraska, comprising eleven exchanges, two of which are located outside the state, and an extensive toll system cover - ing a territory several hundred miles in extent. It now makes appli - cation for authority to increase its exchange and toll rate twenty-five per cent. Applicant serves 2,250 subscribers, for whom it furnishes the equip - ment and in addition switches 1,361 farm telephones, the lines and in - struments of which are owned by the farmers. On July 16, 1916, the Commission issued an order to the Tri-State Telephone company, predecessor of the Wyoming &amp; Nebraska Telephone company authorizing *he issuance of $75,000 of bonds and $108,000 of stock, covering the investment in the entire system to that date. For reasons not necessary to discuss here, the organization of the Trl-State Telephone company was never completed and later the corporation as it now exists was organized and took over all of the property involved. The books were opened, however, on the basis of $183,000 property in - vestment, the sum approved by this Commission. Later certain ex - changes were purchased and extensive additions and betterments were made to the property, so that the property investment stands today at approximately $325,000. Not having checked the books of the company </seg>
            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 475 from the date of tin hearing in the stock and bond case in 1916, the Commission is not prepared to find that fhe figure of $325,000 represents the actual investment by the stockholders in the property, although tes - timony l«i that effect is offered in the record. It is not necessary for the purpose of this case, however, to definitely determine what this fig - ure should be. There is outstanding at the present time common stock in the unount of $172,740 and hills payable in the form of short term notes in the sum of $157,244. The applicant asserts that due to war conditions its expense of operation has been materially increased. The record show.s that appli - cant has lost a large number of trained and experienced employes who were attracted by higher wages paid in other industries, particularly by the railroad companies operating in the territory served by the telephone company. Substantial increases in wages have already been made by applicant and it anticipates that other increases will be necessary in the near future. Not only have increases in wages been necessary but due to the necessity of employing inexperienced help the number of employes has been increased, thus materially adding to the expense. A statement of the operating expenses for the month of October, 1918, is submitted as follows: The item fov maintenance and depreciation in the above statement is based on 9% of the present property value of $325,000. The charge for this purpose submitted by applicant for the month of October was $2,895.60, but this amount was above the normal because of certain re - adjustments due to depletion of the fund in June to enable the company to meet Its dividend payments. It is possible that in the territory In which this company operates and the large wlra mileage required to serre both its toll and exchange patrons would justify an allowance of REVENUES Subscriber's stations Toll Miscellaneous $4,337.47 ... 2,283.46 61.57 Total $6,682.51 EXPENSES Operation Commercial General Maintenace and depreciation (9';; of $325,000).. .$1,336.26 ... 1,151.64 ... 1.300.02 ... 2,437.50 Total $6,225.32 Operating income Taxes ...$ 225.00 $ 457.19 225.00 Net operating income Interest (8% or $157,244) Deducting annual net income ...12,579.52 ... 2,784.00 $ 232.19 Deficit : $9,563.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p474">476 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 10% for maintenance and depreciation. Such an allowance would in - crease the deficit as above shown. It will be noted from this statement that the company is barely pay - ing its actual operating expenses without any surplus for interest or dividends. The increase in expenses anticipated by the company will necessarily increase the amount of the deficit. It is apparent, therefore, that the claim of the company for additional revenues is aaiply justified and that it should be permitted to increase its rates. Applicant has asked for the straight percentage increase of 25% foi both exchange and toll rates. In view of the fact, however, that a uni - form percentage increase when applied to exchange rates will result in rates awkward for both the company and its subscribers, the Commis - sion finds that certain specific rates hereinafter named in the order should be approved. The percentage increase may be applied as a sur - charge to toll rates without the same inconvenience as applies to ex - change rates. The increases resulting from the rates to be approved by the Commission will amount to approximately $17,000 per year. After the anticipated increases in expenses are paid and the interest on the outstanding current liabilities, there will be a surplus available for divi - dends, although it is impossible at this time to estimate what that amount will be. No greater return will be permitted to the holders of notes and stock than has been paid in the past. The increase of rates will also be limited to six months from the effective date of this order, subject to continuation by the Commission on due proof of the necessity. Monthly reports of revenues and expenses, including appropriations to the depreciation reserve fund and expenditures on that account, will be required so as to enable the Commission to keep advised as to the results of the increase. In this connection, applicant should be advised that it should make an effort to re-finance its company with the object of reducing its bills payable and converting them into some form of long time obligations, bearing a lower rate of interest. The present is probably not an opportune time for such re-financing but the company should have it in mind so that it will be effected at the earliest possible date. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Wyoming &amp; Nebraska Tele- phone company be, and the same is, hereby authorized and directed on and after January 1, 1919, and for a period of six months thereafter to charge and collect the following schedule of monthly rates for the serv ice described at the exchanges named, to- wit: Belment: Individual business _ $2.75 Individual residence 2.00 Switching service W Chadron: Individual business _ $3.25 Individual residence 2.00 Party residence 1.76 </seg>

It proposes to construct a transmission line, carrying electric three-phase alternating current of 2400 volts capacity, from its power plant located in the northwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section 25, township 21. range 12 west, Wheeler county, Nebraska; running thence north 2100 feet, thence west 600 feet, thence north 2600 feet on what is known as the Ericson Lake Boulevard, thence west 1600 feet on Pothast avenue, thence northwest 800 feet on said boulevard, thence west 40 rods parallel with the public highway and 30 feet distant from the boundary midway of this distance, leaving said private property at a point on the north - east side of the public highway on the west line of the southeast quarter of section 23, township 21, range 12 west, and thence running northwest one-half mile along the public highway to the village of Ericson, Ne - braska. The proposed line parallels the existing telephone line of the Sky Line Telephone company for a distance of about 80 rods distant from the telephone line about 20 feet for the greater part of the distance and being directly above the line for a portion thereof. It also crosses the line of the Bartlett &amp; Ericson Telephone company at an acute angle at one point and at a right angle at another. The record shows that the proposed line will seriously interfere with the telephone service over the Sky Line company's lines (the lines being of the grounded type) and that it would be a constant menace to the safety of persons using or operating the telephone lines. It appears to be practicable and inexpensive to move the telephone lines of the Sky Line company in question so as to obviate this inter - ference and danger and the applicant offered so to do at its expense. Applicant also offered to use insulated wire in its transmission line where it crosses the lines of the Bartlett &amp; Ericson Telephone company. The Commission finds therefore that the authority to construct said transmission line should be granted as prayed, subject to the per - formance of said offers. </seg>

RAILWAY COMMISSION APPLICATION NO. 3767 In the f'.attcr o." the Application of C. E. Campbell, Owner of Telephone Plant at Western, Nebraska, for Increase of Rates. FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: Applicant's plant supplies telephone service to 165 subscribers re - siding in the village of Western. Nebraska, and 220 farm subscribers residing in the vicinity. The present rates are as follows: One-party business Two-party business One-party residence Two-party residence Four-party residence Farm $2.00 per month 1.50 per month 1.50 per month 1.25 per month 1.00 per month 1.25 per month The piopcsed rates are fifty c five cents greater for all other c 3 nts greater for business and twenty - asses of service. No formal hearing v as held, due to the manifest necessity for an increase of rates, and the fact that rates are always subject to complaint. Applicant purchased the plant June 1, 1912, the consideration being $7,000. The plant then had 250 subscribers. No books of account were kept by applicant's predecessor and applicant is unable to show the - amount invested in the plant prior to his purchase. Owing to the measerness of the consideration, measured by the number of subscriber:; (being only $28.00 per station), it is fair to assume that it was fully covered by the sacrifices of the original owners. Applicant has made subsequent investments in the' "plant, and statement of capital invested is as follows: nf:i;kaska stati T. L. HALL. Chairman Attest: I). M. TAYLOU, Acting Secretary. (SEAL) </seg>

            <seg id="p482">484 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT the sum of $21,015.72 as the capital invested in the property on June 30. 1918. The cost of conducting the business has increased considerably dur - ing the current year, due to the advance in prices of labor and material. The average monthly cost for the first seven months of the year are shown to be $427.25, or $5,127 annually. Applicant has since increased trages 10^ and represents that a further advance in wages will have to be made in order to hold his employes. The advance of 10% amounts to $336 annually, and it is safe to assume that an additional 5&lt;y c advance will have to be made. The expenses for the coming year are therefore estimated at $5,630. to which must be added an allowance of $1,680 as a return upon the capital invested, making the annual budget $7,310. The revenues under the proposed rates, assuming that there will be no loss of subscribers, and including commissions from toll business and other revenues, will amount to $7,066 per annum. The Commission finds, therefore, that the proposed increase of rates is reasonable, subject, however, to the limitation of return to the owner of no more than 8'; per annum upon the capital invested in the property from his own resources, and upon the reinvestment of return in the property to the extent it is done. The attention of the applicant is called to the imprudence of invest - ing all of his net income in the property over and above that due him as a return, as all of this surplus will doubtless be needed for mainte - nance purposes before long. A plant of the size and age of that under consideration should have a reserve for maintenance purposes in an amount equal to 10^ or lo^ of its cost, or from $2,000 to $3,000; and in order to make it available when needed it should be in the form of cash in bank or securities which may be realized upon readily in case of need. Applicant will therefore be prohibited from investing any of the operating revenues in the property beyond the amount due him as a return upon his investment. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the applicant be. and the same is hereby, authorized and directed on and after February 1. 1919, to charge, collect and receive rates of charge for telephone service furnished by his property located in Western. Nebraska, and vicinity as follows: One-party business Two-party business One-party residence Two-party residence Four-party residence Farm residence $2.50 per month 2.00 per month 1.75 per month 1.50 per month 1.25 per month 1.50 per month Extension sets, additional Extension bells, additional 50 per month 25 per month subject to the following conditions: (1) That no greater return shall inure to the applicant than 8% per annum upon the capital Invested in the property, including any deferred return to the applicant that may be so invested. </seg>

Roe; For Commission — Hugh LaMastei OPINION AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner Effective on interstate traffic, carriers operating in Nebraska have a tariff ruje which provides that in making settlement for shortages in ship - ments of bulk grain an arbitrary deduction on account of "natural shrink - age" will be made of one-eighth of one per cent on all small grain and one-fourth of one per cent on co' n. computed in dollar* and cents at the current market price of grain ai the point of delivery. It came to the knowledge of this Commission ih:ough complaint of numerous shippers of grain, that certain of the carriers, viz.. the Union Pacific Raiload company, the Chicago. St. Paul. Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company and the Chicago. Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, were enrorc - ing this rule on traffic originating and terminating within the state of Nebraska, notwithstanding the ariffs of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. and the C. R. I. &amp; P.. as filed with this Commission, make no provisions for such deductions on intrastate traffic, while the tariff of the Union Pacific specifically excepts Nebraska shipments. Whereupon this Commission on December 4, 1917, and December »i. 1917, issued orders citing the car - riers named to appear on December lfc 1917, and show cause why they should not be required to desist from naking such arbitrary deductions on Nebraska traffic. The order.; likewise provided for a full investiga - tion into the practices complained of. </seg>
            <seg id="p484">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 486 At the hearing, ihe Union Pacific and the M. &amp; O. were represented but not the Rock Island. Subsequently, however, the attorney for the Rock Island asked permission to present certain evidence concerning natural shrinkage, but was unable lo secure his witnesses within the time fixed. On behalf of the Union Pacific, it was stated that it is the practice of that company lo make the deductions on all grain originating within the state and billed lo Omaha which is later shipped beyond Omaha to an interstate destination on proportional rates. On whai Ihe company regards as purely intrastate shipments no deductions are made. Under their interpretation of the tariff, however, there are few of these shipments. For the M. &amp; O. it was stated that Ihe deductions art ap - plied to all shipments, irrespective of their state or interstate character. As to the Rock Island, letters from its general supei intendent of freight claims, introduced in the record, indicate that no dislinction is made between stale and interstate shipments. The Union Pacific concedes by its tariff :ind by its admissions in this record that it is not authorized to make the deductions ODD) plained of on intrastate traffic. It contends, however, that shipments of j. r rain originating in the state and billed to Omaha and later moved out of that point on proportional rates are intraslate in character, and on such ship - ments the interstate rule should apply. This presents, so far as .hat company is concerned, only ihe question hs to whether the shipments involved are intrastate or interstate. That question we will refrerre tor discussion later. As regards the other two roads, however, the conditions are differ - ent. They insist upon the right to make the deductions on slate as v ell as interstate traffic, contending that Ihe deductions have been opprovwt! by the Interstate Commerce Commission for interstate shipments, that there is an actual shrinkage of grain in transit, which can best be ac - counted for through an average deduction applied to shipments against which claims are filed and that the deductions should be applied to statt shipments to prevent discrimination The issue is thus squarelv pre - sented as to whether this practice is legal, and if legal, whether i- is i: rate or tariff matter coming under tlie urisdiction of this Commissio"..

Article 11 of ihe Constitution of Nebraska, reads: The liability of railroad corporations as common carriers oiiall never be limited It seem* necessary only to quote the words oL' the constitution to show that the deductions aie prohibited by the organic law of the stale. The railroad company is charged with the responsibility of delivering he number of pounds of grain it has received from the shipper. If it fails to do so it cannot, in making settlement, arbitrarily withhold from ihe shipper any pouiun of the properly which ii has permitted to be de - stroyed. It is argued that thi deductions cover losses not caused b&gt; the rrier, but losses due to the inherent nature of the grain itself, which are attributable to no human agency. To this shippers vigorously dis - seni. They contend that there is no measurable shrinkage of grain in tihnsi;. particularly where H is moved for short distances. An extended investiga, ion by the Interstate Commerce Commission (Claims for Loss and Damage of Grain. 48 1. C. C, 530) disclose that there is some 'oss of weight in shipments jf grain, but that il is due to shrinkage from evupoiation is not conclusively proven. In Cardwell vs U. P. R. R Cu., supra, the court says that the "natural shrinkage of wheat in transit" is 'so well known that the courts will take judicial notice of it." This is the only lecorded declaration of absolute certainly as to this fact, which leads to i!ie assumption that the couri had access to inform; lion hitiierto withheld from those engaged in ihe business, or that the learned jurists possessed a perception not ordinarily given to human minds. There is nothing in the record in ihis ease supporting the contention of the car - riers that there is shrinkage amounting to the arbitrary deductions which they make. On the contrary. Witness Kuhn. for Ihe shippers, con - lends that while there is "some" shrinkage il is "infiniesinial" and will not exceed fifty pounds per car in any case, and that that may result from the elimination of dust in handling or in small quantities of grain being left in the car. It is admitted by counsel for the carriers thai if their contenlion as to natural shrinkage be true, ihe length of haul would be a factor in the loss from this source and the shrinkage vould be atttcted by the condition of the grain at lime of shipment and by weather con- (lit ions during transit. The mat and deductions on such a basis ; A shipper moves a carload of co proven leakage and he files claim is not one of averages, therefore, wholly arbitrary and unreasonable. l from Fremont to Omaha. There is From, the amount of grain lost is de- ducted one-fourth of one per cent of the entire shipment, notwithstand - ing the shrinkage would be absolutely nil, owing to the fact that the corn has been in transit only four or five hours. The liability of the carrier for the loss of the grain through the furnishing of a defective car is thus reduced from $2.00 to $600. In our opinion, this deduction con- </seg>
            <seg id="p486">488 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT stitules an effective ami substantial liinnaium of the carrier's liability. The average movemeni of grain in Nebraska will piobably not ex - ceed one hundred fitly miles, and the time consumed in transit will not exceed from lour to five ilajs. Conceding for the moment that there is natural shrinkage, it would appear that the deduction on Nebraska traffic should be materially less than on interstate traffic, where the shipments a..- much longer and the lime consumed much greater. If the deduction is just and reasonable as to interstate traffic, it follows that it is too high for state traffic, ard by whatever amount it is higher, it is ■ limitation of the carrier's lawful liability, assuming that there is a shrinkage due to evaporation. It is important 10 bear in mind in this connection thai the deduc - tions are exacted only on shipments against which claims are filed. In other words, the carrier limits its liability only in the event of its own neglect in providing a proper car. On cars against which there are no claims for loss, no consideration is given to shrinkage, notwithstanding it may have taken place in the one instance as well as in the other, the condition of the car having nothing to do with such a loss. If there is shrinkage to the amount claimed by the carrier, allowance shoulu be made in assessment of the freight charge, particularly on those cars irom which there has been no loss, otherwise the railroad company is cnarg - ing for grain it does not carry. The Commission has aheady passed upon this point (Informal Com - plaint No. 4245). On October 12, 1916, it served notice upon the Chi - cago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company that it must cancel from Its tariffs an item providing for the same deductions as are involved here. It was held that the item in question had never had the approval of the Commission and that "it was clearly in violation of the provisions of our constitution, which provides that 'the liability of railroad cor - porations as common carriers shall never be limited' ". The Burlington promptly complied with the demand of the Commission by striking the provision from its tariff. In our opinion, nothing has developed in this hearing to justify a change t.cmi that conclusion. With respect lo the proposition that the deductions constitute an ar - bitrary determination in advance, of a disputed question of fact, we have already shown that there is a decided difference of opinion as to whether there is any shrinkage during transit. There is a constant controversy between shippers and carriers over the point. The shipper contends thai the rule is inflexible and arbitrary, while the shrinkage is variable; that the differences vary according to wealher conditions, season of the year, length of haul, and climatic differences between points of origin and destination, and that at times there may be accretions in weight due to moisture absorptions. Nevertheless, the carrier*, without investiga - tion of the facts surrounding the shipment, determine the amount of the shrinkage and make a deduction accordingly, withoui consulting the nhip- t whose property may thus be appropriated. In Baltimore Chamber of merce v«. P. R. R. Co., supra, the Interstate Commerce Commission lined the ruling, saying: </seg>
            <seg id="p487">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 489 "The record indicates that the deductions in question were tair - ly conservative, and upon all the facts disclosed we find that the rule assailed is not shown to be unreasonable." With all due respect for the conclusion of the learned commission, -i a. we cannot but be impressed with the doubtful legality of conferring upon one of the parties to a dispute the right to adjudicate lue issue for "ooth. even though the one so clothed exercises its power in "fairly conserv - ative" manner. As further evidence of the arbitrary character of the deductions we direct attention to the fact that under present methods the railroad com - pany is relieved of all labor and expense of weighing grain a duty e'ear - ly imposed upon it as a common carrier. This is of distinct advantage to the carrier, as the installation and operation of facilities for weigh - ing would entail a large expenditure of money. This burden the ship - per now bears, except on a very small portion of the traffic. If the carrier weighed the grain at point of origin and gave a receipt for the actual number of pounds received, and if it also weighed the grain at point of delivery, thus relieving the shipper of the burden, it would not only be in a better position to determine whether or not there actually is any shrinkage, but it could with better grace assume the right to make a rule for an average deduction. Its default in this respect makes its action all the more arbitrary, and this presents the final proposition as to whether the action of the carrier amounts to a taking of property with - out due process of law. The carriers contend that the whole question involved here is with - out the jurisdiction of this Commission. To this, we agree, as to com - pleted shipments, where the question is one of judgment between the parties concerning their relative rights. If that be true it must then be a matter for the courts. It cannot be a controversy of such peculiar nature as to be exempt from adjudication by any tribunal. The shipper has sustained a loss through the failure of the carrier to deliver the amount of grain committed to its care. There is a dispute as to the amount. The carrier arbitrarily decides the dispute by returning the value of the property less the deduction for shrinkage, to which deduc - tion the shipper objects. Is the shipper to be foreclosed from obtain - ing redress, and if his property is thus appropriated without his consent, is it not taken without legal process? Laws are enacted and courts are established for the adjudication of such disputes, and it is fundamental that one person cannot be deprived of his property by another until the laws and the courts have established the latter's claim to the property. There is no trial here, no submission of evidence, no opportunity for de - fense, no determination of the issues by a disinterested tribunal. In our opinion, it is clearly a violation of the due process clause of the con - stitution. In Shellabarger Elevator Co. vs. Illinois Central R. R. Co., supra, the supreme court of Illinois held the deductions to be against public policy. It was a case Involving the validity of a judgment recovered against the carrier for loss of grain in transit. In Illinois there is a con </seg>
            <seg id="p488">490 ELEVENTH ANNUAL TTSPORT stitutional provision requiring the carrier to ilelive.- as much grain as il receives. The law provides for the weighing of gr.;in by the carrier and for the installation and maintenance of scales for ihe weighing of grain by the caiload in the oars if the same shall have leen loaded at certain points. The defendant did nol maintain scales a:- required by statute. That portion of the opinion relating to the validity of the deductions is as follows: "12. On the back of each ol tiie bill= of lading the following provisions were printed: 'No carrier or pany in possession ol any of ihe property herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage (hereto or delay caused by the act of G-)d, ihe public enemy qurrannne. the aulho/ily of law or tbe act or default of the inp per or owner, or for differences in I lit weights of grain, seed, 01 other commodities caused by natural sh inkage or diacrepan- cies in elevator weights' The Uniform Bills of Lading Act provides ihat a carrier may in - ert in a bill of ladin? any terms or coi-Jilion , not contrary to law or public policy, which do not impair his oblisiiion to use reasonable care, and that ?uch terms and conditions shal- be binding upon the consignor receiving such bill and ru;iking no ibjeclion in writing (o such terms und conditions, so far as they an nol contrary to law or the public policy. No objections in writing weie made by tilt consignor to the conditions on the back of the bills of lading, but we regard that clause in the conditions which t xenipis a carrier from liability for difference in tlie weights of grair seed, or other com - modities caused by discrepancies in elevalo; weights as contrary to public policy. The Statute requires the raili tad company to weigh carefully and coirectly grain received for shipment at the time of its receipt, to give a receipt for the true and ( jrrect amount, -ind to weigh out and deliver the full amount of such exain. without deduc - tion for leakage, shrinkage, or other ioss. The statute was passed in compliance with the requirements 01 section (i of article 13 ol the Constitution, which imposed upon the Gener; 1 Assembly the uuty of passing all necessary laws to give full eff ct to article 11 and directed that sucli article should be liberally construed so as to pro - tect producers and shippers. The object of s ction 4 was the pro - tection of producers and shippeix against sho t weights in delivery through which it was thought they were frequinlly defrauded by the railroad companies out of a part of the grain in each car load; the loss in each c?se being small but amounting n the aggregate to a large sum. In the constitutional convention it was said constani complaints were coming up from th&lt; faimera -i short weights upon shipments, and that the railroad companion were not held, in 'heir own estimation, responsible f&lt;&gt;: the delivery ol ihe same quantity of grain Ihat they received. One member of Ihe convention esti - mated the various frauds and extortions practiced upon the farnieis and shippers by transportation companies, warehouses, and the i.;lse weights used at $10,000,000 a yeai.

While the railroad company is responsible for the delivery of the number of pounds of grain received, and its receipt in the bill of lading evidence of the quantity received, the constitutional pro- vision w;is not intended to make the bill of lading an absolute policy &gt;f insurance, or extend the responsibility of the carrier beyond its responsibility at common law in other respects. Ii is bound to de- liver at the destination the number of pounds of grain received, un - less relieved of this obligation to deliver by the act of God or the public enemy or the negligence of the shipper The court, it will be observed, holds the conditions in the bill of lad - ing covering the deductions to be againsl public policy. In the case which we are considering, the carriers do not have even a contractual relationship with the shipper as a justification for their rule, for the reason that the bill of lading upon which practically all the grain in this slate moves to Omaha does not contain the provision with reference to deductions for shrinkage. The "Uniform Bill of Lading", effective on in - terstate traffic, has never been approved for traffic moving wholly within the state of Nebraska. Moreover, the "Order Bill of Lading", on which practically all grain shipments are made in this state, does not contain the provision for deduction. It is self-evident, of course, that if the p-ac - tice is against public policy where there is a contract, it is equally so if there is no contract. The absence of the contract in this case but further pinphasizes the lack of legal authority of the carrier to enforce the rule. It is probably unnecessary for us to say, in view of the foregoing, that it is our opinion that the question of recovery for loss of grain in transit, insofar as past transactions are involved, is solely one for the courts to determine, in the absence of agreement by the parties, and ihat it is not a rate matter in any sense and should have no place in the tariffs. The C. St. P. M. &amp; O. and the C. R. I. &amp; P. should at once desist from the enforcement of the rule on intrastate traffic State and Interstate Traffic We return now to the determination of the question as to what is in - t last ate traffic, the present interpretation of the tariffs by the Unioo Pa - cific making that necessary. Carriers operating in Nebraska and enter - ing Omaha maintain rates from points in the state to points east beyond the Missouri River which are less than the rate from the Nebraska point to Omaha, plus the rate from Omaha 10 point of destination. In every instance the rate from the interior point to Omaha is the same, but w nere the grain moves eastward, the rate from Omaha to destination is less. For example, the local rate on wheat from Omaha to Chicago is 17 cents </seg>
            <seg id="p490">492 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT per hundred pounds, whereas the "through" or "proportional" rate is 12 cents. The rato on a shipment of wheat from Central City to Chicago on the basis of the "proportional" from Omaha is 24.75 cents- The rate from Central Ciiy to Omaha plus the local rate from Omaha to Chicago is 29.75 cents. In explaining the procedure for allowing the proportional rate, W. H. Hancock, claim agent for the Union Pacific, says: "The exact practice of the Union Pacific is that we make the deduction unless the freight bill is surrendered with the claim. If the freight bill is surrendered, that takes it out of the privilege of going forward, and we do not require any deduction in that case. The freight bills in that case (proportional shipment) to make up the amount going forward, are surrendered to the Western Weighing &amp; Inspection Bureau (by the) party who is going to ship the grain forward on the interstate proportional rate." The question as to what constitutes interstate or intrastate com - merce has been before the supreme court of the United States a num - ber of times, and in our opinion the distinction has been quite clearly denned.

Rep., 562, in which the cases above cited are reviewed and analyzed. We can materially shorten the dis - cussion of this matter and avoid the necessity of reviewing the cases referred to by quoting a portion of the opinion of the court in the latter case. The pertinent facts in that case ere these: The defendants were large cotton brokers, operating in the state of Alabama. They purchased uncompressed cotton at various points in Alabama, shipped it to Bir - mingham, where it was compressed, and there transshipped it to points beyond the state. At Birmingham the original bills of lading were sur - rendered and the shipments rebilled by the defendants to points beyond the state. The court says: "Applying these well established principles to the facts of this case, it appears in the instance we have cited as illustrative of all shipments in issue, that the cotton was shipped upon an intrastate rate to Birmingham, where it remained in the possession and con - trol of the carrier, subject to be divested by the defendents avail - ing themselves of a provision in the bills of lading directing delivery to their order. This the defendents might have dene but never did. Therefore, we are to determine the character of the transportation by what was intended and by what was done with the commodity </seg>
            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 493 t,ans|ioi -it'll, rather than by whml might have been dout' with it. What the defendants did was not to call for delivery and acquire possession according to their right under the bills of lading, but to leave the cotton with the carrier for compression, (a right reserved by it and manifestly to be employed only when cotton was intended to be carried further,) and to direct its transportation by new bills ol lading to points beyond the state. The concentration of cotton at the railroad's presses at Birmingham with the consequent interrup - tion of the journey, was not a circumstance determining that the transportation ended at Birmingham and that therefore it was intra - state in character, but lather indicated the contrary, that compres - sion to reduced bulk, being a thing desired and a right reserved when transportation was intended to be continued, the siop at Birming - ham was not the end of a journey but was merely the interruption necessary io prepare the cotton for a journey to be continued. It was, however, but an incident in the transportation of a commodity of that kind, Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission and Young, 219 U. S. 498, 31 Sup. Ct. 279. 55 L Ed. 310, and it is well settled that the character of traffic, whether interstate or intiastate. musi be gaihered from its nature and not from its in cidents." Turning to the consideration of the Texarkana case, the court ob- serves : "As we read these cases, it appears that the court considered the acceptance and delivery of the commodity by the consignee at the first point of destination as the determining tact. In the Texarkana Case the court said that after the commodity reached its first desti - nation it came within the control of the consignee and thereby the first contract of transportation was completed. In the Iowa Case, it appears that the consignee at the first point ot destination had ac - cepted the commodity, 'had taken delivery' and had assumed full pos - session and control of it, and for that reason the initial contract of transportation was considered at an end before the inirasiate nr.ove - ment began. If these cases turned, as we think they did, upon the circumstances of acceptance and delivery before transshipment, then certainly they are not authority for the case at bar, for in this case, delivery, though possible, was never made to the defendants, and control was assumed by them only to the extent of re-billing, which, as we have seen, is not itself a circumstance determinative of the character of transportation." A brief consideration of the conditions surrounding the traffic in - volved in this case shows that it falls clearly within the requirements for an intrastate movement, as outlined above. Omaha is a terminal market for grain. A grain exchange is maintained there, in which grain of all kinds is bought and sold. Country elevators and dealers out in the state base their prices on the Omaha market and consign their grain to that point for final disposition, selling it and collecting the price for the same. Their ownership in the grain ceases when it reaches Omaha and they are not even remotely concerned as to its future disposition. They pay the carrier the freight for the transportation to Omaha. The grain may be consumed in Omaha, it may be shipped back into the state, or it may be shipped beyond the state. If it is shipped beyond the state line, the shipment is usually made by a second or third party who enters into an entirely new contract with another carrier- </seg>

Such cases disclose marked interstate character - istics rot to be found he 1 " For example, a miller in Omaha buys a car - load of wheat at a poini in Nebraska, ships it to Omaha, grinds it into flour under the milling in; rarsit tariff and then forwards the flour t'i a point jtjond the state line The moment that wheat starts at the poin: of or.r;in in Nebraska, it is in interstate commerce, the stop in Omauu being but an incident in the transportation. The ultimate destination from the beginning must be a point beyond the stale line, otherwise the milling-in-transit privilege would not be utilized . The contract of trans - portation is not completed until the carrier delivers the flour at its destination. In the case at bar, the consignee "accepts the commodity and assumes full possession and control of it." The shipment ends at Omaha. If it is to be resumed, a new contract for transportation .nust be entered into. The fact that the carrier demands the presentation of the freight bill on the original shipment before it will grant the benefit of the lower proportional rate is but a tariff detail which does not modify the characler of the shipment. The inherent nature of a shipment can - not be changed by (he mere method of stating a rate. As the court said in the Davenport case: "The fact that commodities received on interstate shipments are re-shipped by the consignees in the cars in which they are re - ceived to other points of destination does not necessarily establish a continuiiy of movement or prevent the reshipment to a point within the same stale from having an independent and intrastate character." The same principle has recently been announced by the supreme court of Missouri in a case involving shipments of grain from points in Missouri to Kansas City; State ex re I vs. C. M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co. et al, 189 S. W. 377; P. IT. R. 1917-D, 215.

Section 6108, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, reads as fol lows: "The Commission shall investigate any and all cases of alleged neglect or violation of the laws of the state of any railway company or common carrier subject to the provisions hereof, doing business in this state, or by the officers, agent or employes thereof, and take such action with reference thereto as may be provided herein or under the laws of this state providing for the regulation of railway companies or common carriers." Section 6137 is supplemental to the foregoing, and is even more specific as to the duty of the Commission: "Any person, firm, corporation or association, or any mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing society, or any body politic or mu - nicipal organization, complaining of anything done or omitted to be done by any railway company or common carrier, subject to the provisions of this article, or any of the laws of this state, relative to the control and regulation of railway companies or common carriers under which the Commission has authority to act, may apply to the Commission by petition, briefly stating the fact, except as to the fixing", establishing and regulating of rates and charges for the transportation of freight otherwise provided for in this article, whereupon a copy of the complaint shall be served upon such rail - way company or common carrier in the same manner as process in civil cases is served, who shall be required to satisfy the complaint, file a written answer thereto within a reasonable time to be fixed by the Commission. If the railway company or common carrier shall not satisfy the complaint within the time fixed and there shall ap - pear to be a reasonable ground for investigation of the complaint upon its merits, the Commission shall proceed to an inauiry and hearing into the matters complained of in such manner and by such means as it shall think proper, and shall give the parties thereto written notice of the time and place for such hearing, and upon the hearing the Commission shall make such order or orders with re - spect to the complaint as may be deemed just and reasonable. When - ever the Commission has reason to believe that any railway company or common carrier is violating any provisions of this article, or any laws of this slate relative to the control and regulation of railway companies or common carriers, it shall at once institute an inquiry and fix a time and place for hearing hereon, upon their own motion, and shall make any order or orders as may upon said hearing be deemed just and reasonable; Provided, nothing herein shall prevent any person firm, corporation or association or any mercantile, agri - cultural or manufacturing society or body politic or municipal or - ganization or persons proceeding against any railway company or common carrier under the laws of this state for such cases made and provided." These sections of the Railway Commission act leave no doub. as to the intent of the legislature in Imposing upon the Commission the duty of enforcing all of the laws of the state with respect to common carriers: and, it will be observed, the method of procedure is left largely to the </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 497 discretion of the Commission. In cases of violation of the law, it may issue "any order or orders as may upon hearing be deemed just and reasonable." It has been argued that where a specific duty is imposed upon a common carrier by the legislature in an act complete within itself, it is not incumbent upon the Commission to make an order In the premises. This point was given consideration by the supreme court of this state (Hooper Telephone Co. vt. Nebraska Telephone Co., 96 Neb. 245.) The legislature of 1913 passed an act (Chapter 79. Laws of 1913) the title of which is as follows : "An act compelling all persons, associations or corporations do - ing a public telephone business in state to connect trunk or toll lines through their switching stations, and to give and make terminal service to all subscribers from any point in the state of Nebraska, regardless of the ownership of lines or routes over which such mes - sage or service was received, to provide in what manner same shall be done and give certain instructions to the State Railway Commis - sion regarding the division of toll charges and the enforcement of the provisions of this act, and to provide a penalty for the violation of the same, and to repeal all acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith." Upon complaint of the Hooper Telephone company, and after hear - ing, the Commission made an order requiring the Nebraska Telephone company to connect its toll line to the switchboard of the Hooper com - pany, according to the conditions prescribed by the statute. The Ne - braska Telephone company appealed to the supreme court from the order, and in its opinion the court went very thoroughly into the juris - diction of the Commission. Appellant, among other reasons for asking that the order be set aside, contended that the "Commission had no au - thority to make an order in reference to physical connection between telephone lines, at that matter is regulated by statute." On that point, the court said: "It is contended that the statute itself fixes and determines the rights of the public and of individuals, and has le't nothing for thr Railway Commission to do in that regard, and that therefore the State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction in the matter. It must be conceded that the statute is somewhat indefinite as to the duties of the RaihvMv Commission in the matter. The title of the act, how ever, recites that one of the purposes of the act is to give 'certain In - structions to the State Railway Commission regarding the division of toll charges and the enforcement of the provisions of this act," and Section 3 of the act provides that 'in case of a failure to agree (upon division of toll charges) the company where the mes sages originate and the cotupanv where the messages destinate shall report to the Railwav Commission." etc. It is suggested in the appellant's brief,, and perhaps the record discloses, that there are many matters Involved in making physical connections of telephone lines which require adputitmenl in detail where the parties fail to agree and to adjust these matters equitably between the parties would seem to be the proper function of the Commission." It will be noted that the court emphasizes that portion of the act which imposes upon the Cornmtssjos the duty of enfordag the lir It- </seg>

            <seg id="p498">500 ELEVENTH ANNUAL KEPOHT The Mayor and City Commission, the Omaha Chamber of Com - merce and the Omaha Automobile Association, of Omaha, were notified of said hearing, and said notices were also published in the daily papers 01 the city of Omaha. The matter came on for hearing on the day set, but the city au - thorities made no appearance. The Omaha Chamber of Commerce and the Omaha Automobile Association reported to the Commission that they had made studies and investigations as to the relative merits of the near side stop and that as a result they favored sucu change in the service. The Omaha Traction Company appeared by its assistant general manager, R. A. Leussler, who gave valuable information as to the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed stop. At the saine time he stated that he wished to be understood that the Omaha Traction Company was not taking a stand either for or against the proposition; that the Omaha Traction company was seeking to serve its patrons in accordance with the findings and orders of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, and all ordinances passed by the City Commission; and at the same time it desired to furnish the service that would render the most adequate service to the majority of its patrons. He stated that the near side stop would tend to facilitate the movement of the pas - senger traffic on the cars, in that when the near side stop was once es - tablished patrons boarding the cars at the rear end, knowing that the front end of the car would stop in line with the street crossings, would immediately move to the front end of the car, thereby relieving the congestion of the traffic at the rear end. We called particular attention to the fact that under the state law the automobile traffic of the state Is required to stop when approaching street cars from the rear and not pass while the street car is taking on and letting off passengers. The re - sult of this law, taken in conjunction with the far side stop, causes the traffic on the street to block the intersections of the streets. It will not be necessary to go into a detailed explanation of this as It will be apparent that this is true by those who stop to consider the matter. He also stated that while the Omaha Traction company in 1912 was opposed to the near side stop, the company's views had been somewhat modified since that time because of the fact that so many leading citias had gone to the near side stop and that the question of standardization of such service is an important factor to he considered. The Commission on its own motion has made a somewhat extended study of the street car service in this particular for a number of years, and it has reached the conclusion that the near side stop will not only facilitate the movement of the traffic on the street cars, but will tend to relieve the congestion of automobile, team and pedestrian traffic on the streets at the intersections. A hearing in the matter of such service of the Lincoln Traction company has been held, resulting in an order by the Commission directing the Lincoln Traction company to establish and maintain the near side stop. Said service has been put in operation and all studies and invest!- </seg>
            <seg id="p499">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 501 nations of the service established under tho order have proven the adequacy of the service. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the Omaha Traction company should establish what is generally known as the "Near Side Stop." In applying the rule the company itself must exercise some discretion and not undertake to enforce the rule strictly in all cases, but should apply it with a certain elasticity. For instance, at all junction points of the street car lines it might be more practical to operate the out-bound cars in accordance with the far side stop and in-coming cars in accordance with the near side stop. This will relieve the congestion of the cars on the main lines. In adopting the near side stop the company will have to exercise some judgment in varying from the rule in districts where there is no pavement. The Commission believes that where there is no pavement and the streets are muddy the rear end of the car should be used for both entering and exit, and that the motorman should pull his car far enough into the street intersection so that the rear steps of the car will be on a line with the intersecting sidewalk. This can be practically taken care of in such districts because all districts of the city where there is no pavement do not have heavy automobile, team and pedestrian traffic on the streets, and the danger of accidents is negligible. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company, of Omaha, Nebraska, operate its cars on its lines in the state of Nebraska in accordance with what is generally known as the "Near Side Stop," not intending, however, to establish a definite rule at junction points where there are branches leading out from the main lines. The company in establishing this service will use its judgment, as far as possible from a practical standpoint, at such junction points, and if practical will operate the cars in accordance with the suggestions made in the body of this opinion. In unpaved districts the company is directed that as far as practicable it should stop its cars with the rear entrance on a line with the inter - secting sidewalk when the ground is muddy. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the said company shall establish such service on Sunday, March 3. 1918, and that prior to the establish - ment of said service notice shall be given to the public through the press of the proposed change and that on the date of the change, and for a short period thereafter, the front end of the cars shall be placarded with the wording in large letters "NEAR SIDE STOP."

The time of day during which railway companies receive freight for shipment is manifestly an integral part of the service given the public. Action and time are inseparable, and with no denying the public interest in the act of receiving freight for shipment, it neces - sarily follows that a like interest attaches to the time in which the act is performed. The Interstate Commerce Commission took jurisdiction of exactly the same subject matter in the case of The Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce and Merchants' Exchange vs. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio South - western R.

The coming of war greatly intensifies and broadens his powers, in extent and in freedom ot action and ability to deal summarily with new conditions as the military or naval emer gency may demand." The President undoubtedly had the power under the Constitution to take over the railroads for war purposes, but the Congress of the United States confirmed this power beyond cavil by the provision of the act of August 29, 1916. which reads as follows: "The President in time of war is empowered, through the Secre tary of War. to take possession and assume control of any system or systems of transportation or any part thereof, and to utilize the same to the exclusion, as far as may be necessary, of all other traffic thereon for the transfer or transportation of troops, war material and equip - ment, or for such other purposes connected with the emergency as may be needful or desirable."* The language of the Act may be said to he a description of the constitu - tional powers of the President in time of war "As cornmander-in-ehief of ♦Quoted matter herein in connection with which no reference is given, are excerpts from an opinion rendered to the New York State Public Service Commission for the First District by William L.

A state law or an order of this Commission relating to a service of the railroads to be performed wholly within the state is a "police regu - lation" within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act of Congress, if it can be shown to be in the public interest. "The indentity of 'police regulations' with the 'police powers' has been several times established." Railroad Co. vs. Fuller, 84 U. S. 560; Sligh vs. Kirkwood, 237 V. S. 59; C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v*. Illinois, 200 U. S. 561 "These words were authoritatively stated on the floor of Con - gress to 'have reference to the police powers of the states.' And this is their obvious meaning." Perhaps also the express reservation to the states of their police powers was dictated by constitutional necessity, inasmuch as the su - preme court of the United States has held repeatedly that those powers belong exclusively to the state and that they were not delegated by the states to the national government under the constitution. At any rate, here is an express construction of every provision of the Federal Control of Railroads Act affecting the rights of the states by the Act itself and the sole concern of any of the states in enforcing present police regula - tions, or adopting further ones, is whether or not the regulation in ques - tion, in the language of the act, "may affect the transportation of troops, war materials, government supplies, or the issue of stocks and bonds." The exception contained in Section 10 is even subject to the explicit interpretation contained in Section 15. The word "affect" has a very elastic meaning in ordinary usage, but according to all legal interpretation of the word in statutory form it is held to mean to act injuriously upon or to affect adversely to a sub - stantial degree. The United States Supreme Court construed the word in the sense of acting injuriously in the case of Ryan vs. Carter, 93 U. S. 78. The case involved a federal statute relating to rights of property in the territory acquired from France by a treaty of April 30, 1803. The treaty provided that the right, title and claims to certain lots and com - mons in the territory of Missouri are confirmed to the inhabitants of the territory according to their several rights or rights of common thereto. The treaty contained the following clause: "Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect the rights of any persons claiming the same lands, or any parts thereof, whose claims have been confirmed by the Board of Common for adjusting and settling claims to lands in the said terri - tory." The court said in the course of the opinion: "It is unnecessary to give the various definitions of the word &gt;ff«ct.' It is enough to say that it is often used in the sense of </seg>
            <seg id="p507">509 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION acting injuriously upon persons and things; and in this sense we are all of the opinion it was used in this proviso. This interpretation accords with the reason and manifest intent of the proviso." The carriers in the instant rase desire to close their receiving freight houses to the public at four o'clock p. m. during the first five days of the week and at one o'clock p. m. on Saturdays. The shippers desire the retention of the present closing hours, which are 4:45 p. m. in Omaha and 5:00 p. m. in the other cities named herein during the first five days of the week and 1 o'clock p. m. on Saturdays. The issue before the Commission, practically speaking, is the closing of the freight houses at a time included within these limits. The question is, therefore, will such a closing of the freight houses act injuriously upon terials, government supplies, or th conceivable almost that variation ( freight houses are open for the re cities in Nebraska can have an api of the general government or up&lt; properties of the carriers. There closing time bears any relation to reffected in th« carriers' securitie "the transportation of troops, war ma - s issue of stocks and bonds."

Cer - tainly, if it were shown that the government desired to make use of the receiving freight houses after a certain hour of the day to the exclusion of the public, or even that the business of the government would be greatly expedited if a certain closing time was adopted, an order of this Commission conflicting with these And similarly, if the closing time enhanced the expense of the car prices of their securities None government needs would not be valid, prescribed by the Commission greatly iers ami thereby reduced the market these influences appear of record, however. Neither can any of them be reasonably anticipated from an or der of the Commission in the premises. It may be urged that the Commission is powerless to enforce its orders against the federal officials in control of the carriers, on the ground of the apparent incongruity of the control of national authority by the state. It looks like an anomalv to have a branch of the federal govern- ree. Suffice it to say, in reply to s referred to expressly preserved ment regulated by the state in any de this objection ,that the Act of Congn such control to the states in so far cerned, subject to the exceptions note as their internal affairs are con- The expressed will of the Con- gress in this respect would be wholly set aside if the states had no remedy for their rights. However, such control is not without precedent in our history and is seen to be wholly within the constitutional limita - tions upon the exercise of authority, federal and state. The lawful powers of federal officials, even to the president, in the discharge of their duties were made very clear in one of the earliest cases which came before the United States supreme court as to the Interpretation of the Federal Constitution. This was the celebrated case of Marbury vs. Madi- </seg>
            <seg id="p508">ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 1 C ranch 137, the decision in which has since been followed in ever involving the same question. The court said: (P. 166) 510 and •'By the constitution of the United States, the President is in - vented with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own ili.-eretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience. To aid him in the performance uf t'iese dutie.- he is authorised to ap point certain officers, who net •&gt;;■ his authority, and In conformity with his orders. In such cases, their acts are his acts; and whatever opinion may lie enterteined of the manner in which executive disc?-. tion may be used, still there exists, and can exist, no power to con - trol that discretion. The subjects are political; they respect the nation, not individual rights, and beins entrusted to the executive, the decision of the executive is conclusive. The application of this re - murk will be perceived, by adverting to the act of Congress for es tablishing the department of foreign affairs. This officer, as his duties were prescribed by that act, is to conform precisely to the will of the President; he is the mere organ by whom that will is communicated. The acts of such an officer, as an officer, can never he cxaininablc by the courts. But when the legislature proceeds to impose on that officer other duties; when he is directed peremptorily to perform certain acts; when the rights of individuals are depend - ent on the performance of those acts; he is so far the officer of the law; is amenable to the laws for his conduct; and cannot, at his discretion, sport away the vested rights of others. "The conclusion from this reasoning is, that where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the execu - tive, merely to execute the will of the President, or rather to act in cases in which the ex -cutive possesses a constitutional or legal dis - cretion, nothing can b&lt; more perfectly clear, than that their acts are only politically exami:iable. But where a specific duty is assigned by law. and individual riehts depend upon the performance of that dutv, it seems equally clear, that the individual who considers him - self Injured, has a rU'ht to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy." (at page it; in : "With respect to the officer to whom it would be directed. The intimate political relation subsisting between the president of the I'nited States and th9 heads of departments, necessarily renders any legal investigation of the acts of one of those high officers pe - culiarly irksome, as v.-ell as delicate; and excites some hesitation with respect to the propriety of entering into such investigation. Impressions are often received, without much reflection or examina - tion, and it is not wonderful that in such a case as this, the asser - tion, by an individual, of his leeal claims in a court of justice, to which claims it is tho duty of that court to attend, should at first view be considered bv some, as an attempt to intrude into the cabi - not. and to Internteddle with the prerogatives of the executive. "It is scarcely necessary for the court to disclaim all preten - sions to such a jurisdiction. An extravagance, so absurd and ex - cessive, could not have been entertained for a moment. The pro - vince of the court is. solely to decide on the rights of individuals, uol to inquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion Questions in their nature political, or which are, by the constitution and laws, submitted to the executive can never be made in this court. "But. if this be not such a question; if, so far from being an in - trusion into the secrets of the cabinet, it respects a paper which, ac- </seg>

The government may be said to be In the position of u lessee of the roads, as sums equivalent to a rental based on earnings prior to the war are to be paid to the owning corporations. The Director General and his advisory staffs "have been subKiltiitt'il for the presidents, directors and operating heads of the sev - eral companies, are operating the properties in the place and stead of tbeir former corporation officers, and are subject to the same provisions of law except in M fui as the Federal Control Act provides otherwise and sets up substitute regulations and procedure." Apparently this is the view taken of the matter by the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky in the case of Muir V. L. A. N. R. R. Co., 247 Fed. 8Ss, from which opinion the following excerpt is taken: "The proclamation designates Mr. Mc.Adoo as Director General of Railroads. This position being unknown to the law, its powers are not tixed. but we suppose it was the intention to make him, not only a member, but the head, of the board of directors of each rail - road company." It will not be contended that the power of the states to tax railroads under federal control has been taken away. The powers of taxation and regulation are both sovereign in their origin, the power of taxation being the more drastic of the two. Both are mentioned together in Section 10 of the act. and if the taxing power may properly be exercised it neces - sarily follows that the power of regulation also stands. No new remedy was provided tor the enforcement of the taxing rights of the state, there - fore none is needed for the enforcement of the rights of regulation. The remedies in each case are provided by .state law, and it is altogether in - conceivable that Congress intended to depart from the established prin - ciple of our legal institutions that wherever there is a right there is a corresponding remedy, especially in view of the existence of clearly de - fined remedies. The argument as to the jurisdiction of the states and their remedies should perhaps be further fortified by reference to a noteworthy deci - sion of the United States Supreme Court germane to the subject. The case of Reagan vs. Mercantile Trust Company, 154 U. S. 413, involved the validity of an act of the Texas legislature establishing a railroad com - mission, with power to regulate rates, and certain rates of the commis ston. The Trust company was a trustee in a deed of trust executed by the Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co., a corporation organized under the laws of the United States. Counsel for the trust and railway companies con - tended that inasmuch as the railway company was a federal corporation it was not subject to control by the state. The court overruled the con - tention, and said, through Mr. Justice Brewer, author of the opinion: "Similarly we thing it may be said that, conceding to Congress the power to remove the corporation in all its operations from the control of the state, there is in the act creating the company nothing which indicates an intent on the part of Congress to so remove it, </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 513 and there is nothing in the enforcement by the state ot reasonable rates for transportation from discharging all the duties and exercising all the powers conferred by Congress. By the act of incorporation Congress authorized the company to build its road through the state of Texas. It knew that, when constructed, a part of its business would be the carrying of persons and property from points within the state to other points also within the state, and that in so doing it would be engaged in a business, control of which is nowhere by the Federal Constitution given to Congress. It must have been known that, in the nature of things, the control of that business would be exercised by the state, and if it deemed that the interests of the nation and the discharge of the duties required on behalf of the nation from this corporation demanded exemption in all things from state control, it would unquestionably have expressed such inten - tion in language whose meaning would be clear. Its silence in this respect is satisfactory assurance that, in so far as this corporation should engage in business wholly within the state, it intended that it should be subjected to the ordinary control exercised by the state over such business. Without, therefore, relying at all upon any ac - ceptance by the railroad corporation of the act of the legislature of the state, passed in 1873 in respect to it, we are of opinion that the Texas and Pacific Railway company is, as to business done wholly within the state, subject to the control of the state in all matters of taxation, rates and other police regulations." In the foregoing case the act in question was silent as to state con trol, which was sufficient to deny the claim that Congress intended that the railway company should be free from such control. Other decisions of the United States Supreme Court could be cited to the same effect, and there is no escape from the conclusion that in order to oust the states from all jurisdiction over the carriers under government control there must be an assertion by Congress of such authority as will ex elude the states, to say the least. Proceeding to a consideration of the merits of this case: The field covered by the record is unusually broad for a state commission in that it concerns the relationship between the jobbing cities of Nebraska and other competing cities in the states of Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas. This competition is so strong and keen as to all of the elements of trade, including transportation service, that substantially different hours for receiving outbound freight in the various cities would be reflected in the respective volumes of trade to the advantage of the cities enjoying longer hours. The opening hour of the freight houses is the same in all of the cities, towit, 7:00 a. m., but the closing hours vary as follows: Omaha, 4:45 p. m.; all other cities in Nebraska, 5:00 p. m.; Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and other western Iowa jobbing points, 5:00 p. m.; St. Joseph, Atchison, and other lower Miss - ouri river cities 4:30 p. m,, and 1:00 p. m. on Saturdays in all of them. It was shown that variation in the closing time of freight houses of halt an hour only was used to advantage in securing trade, and that to se - cure absolute parity as between the cities, the closing time should be uniform. However, tne extra territorial nature of this proceeding does not affect the jurisdiction of the Commission, nor does it impair the power </seg>
            <seg id="p512">514 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the Commission to effectively deal with the situation. There may be tome question as to the power of a state commission to deal with dis - crimination which is partly the result of the acts of the carrier performed beyond the boundary of the state, but the nature of the service involved herein can be determined alone upon the ground of adequacy and rea - sonableness. The hours for receiving freight in jobbing cities have hitherto been governed more by the practice in that respect throughout the country than by purely local conditions. The carriers perform all of their services in these cities, excepting the receiving and delivering of freight, throughout the entire 24 hours, and there is no inherent reason ror the exception. Consequently the hours for receiving freight in any of the cities of the country may well be held to be reasonable hours in all cities. This view of the situation is confirmed by a statute of this state, which prescribes that railroad companies shall immediately receive freight for shipment when the same is tendered; and the enactment is without any limitation as to the hours of the day. (Section 6159, Re - vised Statute* of Nebraska, 1913). This statute would appear at first glance to oust the Commission of jurisdiction in the premises, but examination discloses that the act is broader than its title by this very requirement; hence, it is of no effect U a regulatory measure. However, if the statute were valid it would have to be construed in the light of the ordinary practice of shippers in tender - ing freight for shipment and ot what would be adequate service on the put of the carrier. This is the measure we propose to apply in this The practice of the shippers in jobbing cities as to the hours during which freight is tendered to the carriers for shipment has been deter - mined by the carriers, in so far as the closing time is concerned. The record shows that the shippers are able and anxious to tender freight as late as 6:00 p. m. or even later. Through the operation of competition and economic law a policy on the part of the country merchants of plac - ing orders with the jobbers when their stock of particular commodities were low has been established. This is by reason of the public demand for fresh goods, especially in fruits, meats .groceries and other perish - able articles, and for the much greater variety of merchandise now pro - duced over that of former years. This situation has been accentuated by the limitations of the United States Food Administration upon the amounts of particular commodities that retailers have in their posses - sion, and by the tremendous increase in prices during the war, which has greatly curtailed the buying capacity of the retailer. This situation naturally led to the adoption of a correlative policy on the part of the Jobbers to fill buyers' orders as quickly as possible. It was shown of record that approximately 87 per cent of the orders received by the jobbers during the day is filled the same day, and that practically all of the remaining 13 per cent would be filled if deliveries of freight could be made to the carriers up to 6:00 p. m. If the freight houses were to close at 4:00 p. m. instead of the present hours, the amount of orders </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 515 The situation so far as the shippers are concerned is further aggra - vated by the fact that their employes who are engaged exclusively in assembling and loading the freight on to drays have little to do after the departure from the warehouse of the last loads for the day; and limited as this leaving time is to fifteen minutes prior to the freight house closing time, there is considerable loss on the part of the jobbers in the services of these employes. There is likewise a similar loss to the draying concerns in that the draying facilities used in transporting shippers' merchandise to the freight houses cannot be used for any other purpose, practically speaking. Weighing such a situation in view of the carriers' legal duty to give the public such service as it needs and demands, ample compensation being paid therefor, the circumstances surrounding the consignor and consignee would appear to be controlling and to require that the carriers continue, as heretofore, to receive freight up to the hours of 4:45 or 5:00 o'clock p. m. However, the shippers and their customers need and demand the delivery of freight throughout the state on the day following its receipt by the carriers. On that account the facilities of the carriers must be taken into consideration, both as to freight house and train service. The situation at the Omaha freight houses and the leaving time of the trains at that station, only, are necessary to be considered as to this phase of the matter. This is owing to the fact that the Omaha L. C. L. mer - chandise trains serve all of the other cities involved herein, and start from Omaha shortly after present freight house closing hours; and they must do so in order to make deliveries from all of the cities on the fol - lowing day. It may also be said that the situation at Omaha, or at auy one of the cities, is determinative as to closing hours in that all of the cities compete with each other for the trade of the state, and different hours for receiving freight would result in undue preference or discrimination. And further, that the conditions surrounding the service of any one of the principal carriers must be allowed to govern, assuming that the service is sufficient in reason; otherwise, the desired parity would not be maintained as between the cities involved, or as between the carriers themselves. We will undertake, therefore, to make an analysis of the Omaha situation as it exists in connection with the Burlington. North Western and Union Pacific companies— the principal carriers involved. The re- ceiving freight houses in Omaha are but little more than car-loading platforms. The ground dimensions of these houses are approximately as follows : Burlington — 36 feet wide and 900 feet long; North Western— 40 feet wide and 920 feet long; Union Pacific— 128 feet wide and 645 feet long. </seg>
            <seg id="p514">516 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT One side of the long way of the houses Is used by the draymen In un - loading goods into the freight house and the opposite side is used for the spotting of cars for loading. The Burlington and North Western houses are enclosed, and have doors for the Ingress and egress of the freight. The former has doors enough to accommodate seventy drays at one time, and the latter twenty-two drays. The Union Pacific nous* la not enclosed, excepting with a roof .and can accommodate about sixty - two drays at one time. A similar situation exists at Lincoln with re - ■pect to the principal carrier, the Burlington; its freight receiving house being forty feet wide and 384 feet in length, with no enclosure whatso - ever. It will accommodate from thirty-five to forty drays at one time. Car* are spotted alongside the freight house during the previous night sufficient in number to accommodate the receipts of the following day In the judgment of the carriers. The Inbound freight houses of the carriers are separate from the outbound houses and are of much greater capacity, in order to accommo - date the freight not called for promptly and for which storage must be provided. A single labor force is used to perform the work of both bouses, but, as now carried on, the force is used during the greater part of the forenoons to unload, check and place inbound freight. Cars con - taining the inbound freight arrive at the station almost altogether dur - ing the night time and the use of the force in unloading them in the morning Is entirely proper. While engaged in handling outbound freight they are divided into gangs, usually of five men each, consisting of one checker, three truckmen and one stower, or stevedore. The office of the checker is to check the goods on the shipper's bill of lading as thev are taken from the dray or placed upon the receiving platform; the truckers load the goods upon trucks and move them to the cars, and tne ■tower places the goods in the car according to consignee and destina - tion. The Burlington employs from twelve to twenty of these gangs; the Union Pacific, thirteen to seventeen; and the North Western, fourteen to eighteen. The capacity of the Burlington gangs averages about five tons per hour each, and the Union Pacific and North Western about four tons. The greater capacity of the Burlington employes may be said to be due to the use by them of electric trucks and to the payment of t scale of wages based upon tonnage. The Union Pacific and North West - ern use hand trucks altogether and wages are fixed upon the hour basis. The record shows that the men are worked to their full capacity every hour of the day. In fact, though the men are hired on a ten-hour work - day basis, commencing at 7:00 a. m. and ending at 6:00 p. m., they are obliged to work from one to three hours over time every day, excepting Saturday, during the greater part of the year. The policy of the car - riers with reference to the load imposed upon these men appears to be the keeping of a vast amount of work always ahead of them throughout the week up to Saturday afternoon, when a clean-up is made by reason of the earlier public closing of the freight houses. This Is further </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 517 evidenced by the fact of record that from fifteen to twenty per cent of the outbound freight received during the day Is carried over until the following day. The carriers claim that the over-time work of the freight home force, as well as the carrying over of outbound freight until the follow - ing day, is due to the lateness of the freight house closing hour, and to the practice of the shippers in delivering the bulk of their freight in the afternoon. This is partly true. The record shows that the time re - quired in which to receive an average drayload of freight from the shipper and place it in the car, including the checking, trucking, stow - ing and billing of it, is one hour and thirty minutes. With the freight house closing at 4:45 or 5:00 p. m., the over-time would amount to from fitteen to thirty minutes on this basis. As to the deliveries of freight by the shippers, the record shows that appromixately 30% is made in the forenoon, 30% between 1:00 p. m. and 3:00 p. m., 2&lt;&gt;% between 3:00 p. m. and 4:00 p. m., and 20% between 4:00 p. m. and closing time. The outbound tonnage is about 60% of the total of inbound, transfer, and outbound tonnage handled in the freight houses, and, assuming that all the freight house force is engaged in handling outbound freight in the afternoons, which appears to be the case, it is plain from the record that the tonnage delivered after 3:00 p. m. is considerably in excess of the capacity of the force; and whenever the capacity of the force is ex - ceeded, the draymen unload the freight upon the freight house floor in the manner most convenient to them and without having it checked by the checker. As consequence and by reason of the narrowness of the freight houses, the freight accumulates in piles upon the floor and at the doorways, with the result that the carriers' work of checking, trucking and storing into cars is greatly impeded. This is a daily occur - rence at the Omaha and Lincoln freight houses and is said by the car - riers to be the principal cause of loss and damage to freight, and delays and errors in transit. The shippers claim that the lateness of their deliveries is not their fault altogether and that it is primarily due to the failure of the carriers to promptly receive freight tendered to them in the forenoon. They contend, which is a fact, that the freight house force is largely em - ployed in handling the inbound and transfer freight during the forenoons, and that the draymen have great difficulty in getting the force to handle outbound freight delivered during that period of the day; and that hav - ing to deliver the bulk of their shipments after noon in consequence, they suffer great inconvenience at that time by reason of insufficient freight house men to properly receive the goods. All in all, the situation in Omaha subjects the shippers to grave delay, not only in delivering their goods to the carriers but in the for - warding by the carriers to consignees of a substan''al portion of the shipments, and it subjects carriers to msrh concision and inefficiency within the freight houses, to undue finaii' ial loss by ivasoii ol damaged and lost freight, and delays ia the nin»..ii»nt of trvi!4. </seg>
            <seg id="p516">518 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT It Is not apparent, howewv Jim e.w i&lt; r closing of tho freight houses alone would relieve the situation in any considerable degree. This was admitted by the principal witnesses for the Burlington and North West - ern roads. The same amount of freight would be tendered the carriers aa before, and the narrowing of the time in which to do so would only add to the congestion within the freight houses; unless the carriers employed more men. The paucity of the freight house forces appears to be the chief cause of the trouble. The constant employment of the men. and the extent of their labors over time, is alone proof of this fact. No doubt they would handle the freight much more expeditiously end get through the day's work more nearly on time if the floors did not be - come no greatly congested with goods mixed up without regard to con - signee or destination. But that does not appear to be the fault of the shippers altogether. Their drays can get into position to unload only up to the phyesical capacity of the receiving platforms and if a gang of men was provided to check, truck away and stow the goods in cars promptly on delivery by the draymen there would be no congestion on the floors. This is what is known as "tailboard delivery service" — the carrier receiving the goods as they are unloaded from drays, and is the kind of ■errice that the carriers contend should be adopted in this case, so far aa preventing the shippers from unloading freight until the freight house men are ready to receive it. The physical construction of the receiving freight houses impera - tively suggests that some service of this kind should be adopted. The freight houses are nothing more than car-loading platforms, owing to their extreme narrowness compared with their dray-unloading capaci - ties. With the exception of the Union Pacific house at Omaha, they are Incapable of containing any merchandise that will not interfere more or less with the work of the men in trucking to the cars. However, it would be uneconomic and unreasonable to require the carriers to man their freight houses sufficiently to immediately receive the freight the moment drays are in position to unload. Bearing in mind that the Burlington freight house at Omaha will accommodate about seventy drays at one time and the Union Pacific sixty-two, such a service would require corresponding numbers of freight house gangs and would increase the present forces fourfold. The relief must come partly by the increase of these forces, partly by reasonable uniformity of ■nippers' deliveries throughout the day, and a closing hour of the freight houses that will enable the carriers to load all of the freight received during the day prior to the times of departure of their merchandise trains. The carriers admit that a larger freight house force would acceler - ate the handling of freight. That they have not employed more men In the past appears to be due to the hopelessness of combating the situa - tion by that method alone, it being impossible to secure men for the *hort time in the afternoons when the bulk of the deliveries are made. </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 519 But with a more com tart vi lume of deli ries throughout tlie day, there is no reason w;.v t ■■» ireijht c -nt be hanciiod fhjrtly after it is tendered; and goods aro legally i«Mu'?red to the carriers the moment they are upon tt ■ l!o - 01 the freight ho::.-, propsr!; 1 :ri:\: d as to con- signee and dest aatic.: and correct billing instructions applicable there- to are given th( earlier. It requires from filteen to thirty minutes to unload an avera e drajicad on to the freight house floa-, and about the same length of time in which t^ truck that amount o. freight to the cars and stow i.. And ii the dray end freight house men work in con- junction the entire time is n i ;;.jre than an hou Concerning unKormity o. L,:.:ppers' deliveries, the record is all one way to the effec". tiiat tne ._:•„_■ ..lepers are able and willing to main - tain a fairly constant volume of deliveries throughout the day, provid - ing the carriers receive the goods with reasonable promptness on the drays coming into position for unloading. Approximately 38% of cus - tomers' orders arrive at the jobbers' offices at 7:30 a. m., 22% addi - tional at 8:30 a. m., and 127, additional at 10:30 a. m. These, together with the 13% of orders received late and not filled during the previous day, amount to 757r of all orders received. The time required by the jobbers on the average to fill an order and deliver it to the freight house is approximately two hours. It is therefore physically possible for the shippers to make 759$ of their deliveries before 2:00 p. m. of each day. and they would seek to do so but for the need of uniformity in their work Practical objections to this ability of the shippers on the whole to malte deliveries exists in the case of jobbers of fruits and vegetables and packers of fresh meats — articles that are more or less perishable during the extremes of temperature in summer and winter seasons. Freight of this character is transported in refrigerator cars mostly and delivering it in the lorenoon would result in its exposure to the weather for hours, inasmuch as the cars are not closed until 5:00 or 6:00 p. m., just prior to being entrained. Also, the meat packers are located at South Omaha, a distance of five miles or more from the freight houses; and they make about 95% of their deliveries by means of railroad cars spotted and loaded at their plants and switched to the freight houses when full. They load these cars in the forenoons, the cars reaching the freight houses about 3:00 p. m. The remaining 5% of packers' shipments is conveyed to the freight houses by trucks atter the departure of the railroad cars Another grievance of the carriers against the shippers should be mentioned, to-wit, the failure of many of the shippers, and especially the meat packers, to deliver shipments intact as to consignee and desti - nation. A sTngle shipment consists usually of many articles, and a dray or car load contains many shipments, yet the articles are delivered mixed up without regard to individual shipments. This adds greatly to the work of the freight house men and results in considerable errors in forwarding the freight. </seg>
            <seg id="p518">520 ELKVENTH ANNUAL REPORT The remedy (or this situation does not lie primarily in the public closing of the freight houses much earlier than at present. As previous - ly indicated, it must haw a broader scope so as to take into account the duty of the shippers to the carriers as well as the duty of the carriers to the shippers The reasonable and adequate service due from the carriers necessarily embraces both of these obligations, and the Com - mission would be remiss in its duty, after conducting so exhaustive an investigation on its own motion, if it went no further than to pass upon the particular issue involved — the time of day within which the carriers Khali receive freight for shipment. First determining, however, the question at issue, — the closing time of the freight houses must necessarily be governed by the times at which the principal merchandise trains of the leading carriers leave their re - spective stations at Omaha, which times are as follows: Union Pacific, C:1S p. in.; Burlington, 7:45 p. m.; and North Western, 8:15 p. m. As previously stated, these trains serve the shippers of all of the cities named, either directly or by means of connecting trains, and the freight houses should close at a time sufficiently in advance of train leaving times to enable the freight house force to check, truck, stow, and bill all of the freight received during the day. The record shows that the time required to so handle a drayload of merchandise is one hour and thirty minutes, and that an additional half hour's time is required to entrain the cars. The variation In the leaving times of the trains renders exact - ness Impossible, but the Commission is satisfied on the whole that a closing time of 4:30 p. in will enable the shippers to deliver all of the goods reasonably required of them by their carriers, allowing for the uni - formity of deliveries; and that such a closing hour will enable the carriers to forward all of the freight received by them during the day, on schedule time, providing they employ enough freight house men to handle the freight within u reasonable time after it is tendered to them. As to the additional features required by the situation, the Commis - sion find* that each an&lt;l every one of the carriers named in the caption hereof should be riM|iiir&gt;-ii to formally receive all less than carload mer &lt; hundlxe tendered to them for shipment at their respective receiving freight houses in the cities herein named within thirty minutes immedi - ately following such tender and to truck away from the platforms or freight house floors upon which the same is deposited by the shipper, ami stow the .an. i- into cars to the capacity of the cars designated by the carriers for such loading on the day in question, within one hour immediately following such tender, provided that such trucking or stow - ing shall not be required of shipments held by the carriers in conse - quence of errors in marking or in shippers' billing instructions or as to articles damaged and held for further order either of the shipper or of the carrier; provided further, that preference shall be given to the receipt and disposition of all supplies of the general government, in - cluding war supplies.

At the same time and in connection with the same matter, the Com - mission adopted an order directed to all shippers of less than carload freight between any of the cities named above and points within the state of Nebraska to show cause on the same day "why the Commission should not make and enter an order upon each and every of the carriers named In the caption hereof to refuse to receive more than 50% of shipments of less than carload merchandise other than fresh fruits and vegetables and fresh meats made by single shippers when the aggro,&lt;;ur&lt;&gt; weight of such shipments in any one day exceeded ten thousand pounds in weight after the hour of 2 o'clock p. m. of each day; and why the Comission should not make and enter an order permitting each and every of the carriers named in the caption hereof to refuse to receive at their re - spective stations in any of the cities named herein shipments that are not intact as to consignee and destination, the several articles compris - ing an individual shipment to be together when tendered to the carrier either upon the freight house floor or in railroad cars." The carriers filed formal objections to the proposed order directed against them, which challenged the jurisdiction of the Commission to make the order, and denied its practicability. The following grounds were assigned, In substance: 1. That the carriers are in the possession and control of the federal government by virtue of the orders of the President of the United States made tn pursuance of his constitutional and statutory powers, and the proposed order is inconsistent with such powers. S. The proposed order "affects me transportation of troops mater - ials, government supplies, because it requires (a) the maintenance of a </seg>
            <seg id="p523">Nebraska state railway commission 525 supply of freight cars at the points of loading without regards to the war needs elsewhere and it requires (b) a similar maintenance of a force of railroad employes at points of loading and it requires (c) the afore - said supply of freight cars without regard to the number of freight cars which the government has supplied for the operation of its whole sys - tem, while the number of such cars and the supply thereof is, under the act of Congress, determined wholly by the President." 3. The order removes the control of the Director General over the car supply and terminal employes, and nullifies his orders. 4. The order discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce. 5. The requirements of the proposed order are not "police regula - tions within the meaning of the aforesaid acts of Congress." 6. The proposed order affects the operation of the carriers' property and is therefore inconsistent with the power of the President to "pro - vide terminals, motive power, cars and other equipment necessary or desirable for war purposes or in the public interest." 7. The proposed order deprives the carriers of property without due process of law contrary to the federal constitution. 8. The proposed order is in "conflict with the statutes of the state of Nebraska referring to the time when the carriers shall receive and transport shipments of freight within the state." 9. "The receiving and stowing of freight under the requirements of the proposed order is impractical as an every day working proposi - tion in the operation of freight terminals, both as to time and the pos - sibility of procuring the necessary help to comply therewith." 10. The proposed order "in so far as it requires shippers with 10,000 pounds of freight per day or more to deliver 50 % thereof on or before 2 o'clock p. m. is a discrimination against said shippers and a preference for all shippers having less than 10,000 pounds, or those having fresh fruit, vegetables or fresh meats." The shippers filed no formal protests to the proposed order of the Commission, but witnesses in their behalf at the hearing objected to the making of the order relating to the acceptance of freight by the carriers. The carriers' objections to the jurisdiction are overruled for rea - sons set forth in the opinion accompanying the order dated July 1, 1918. The regulations contemplated by the proposed order relate wholly to the operation of the carriers within the state, and where they affect inter - state commerce they are so commingled with acts affecting intrastate commerce that separation is impossible. Also, the big bulk of the business affected is intrastate — approximately 75% at Omaha, 85% at Lincoln and still greater in the more inland cities. And the proposed order, instead of acting injuriously upon the transportation of govern - ment and war supplies, actually benefits such transportation by the preference given to it. Counsel for the carriers did not stress these ob - jections at the hearing after learning that the proposed order did not require them to receive freight for less than carload loading beyond the </seg>
            <seg id="p524">526 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT capacity of the cars designated by them to such loading on the day in question, and that the order did not impose any new duty upon them ae to providing rare for such loading Considering the impracticability of the proposed order: The record ■hows that the carriers can receipt for shipments of freight within thirty minutes after they are deposited upon the platform or floor of the freight house up to the capacity of the cars designated by them for less than carload loading on the day in question, and can stow them into such cars within one hour after the deposit, provided a considerable uniformity is secured In the deliveries of freight to them throughout the day and pro- Tided the freight is delivered to them somewhat intact as to the cars Mo which it is to be loaded. Given these conditions, the only remain - taf obstacle Is the labor with which to do the work.. No shortage of freight house labor existed at the time of the hearing, and none is antici - pated If wages keep step with the pay in similar fields of labor, as they promise to do. The federal railroad administration is fully alive to the necessity for paying whatever wages are necessary to operate the rail - roads In the most efficient way. and is setting a standard of wages in the railroad Held which apparently leads rather than follows the general •eale of wages. The real problem is the securing of such deliveries of freight by the shippers as will tend to the greatest efficiency in the handling of freight by the carriers. A steady volume of deliveries is the first desideratum. The carriers objected to the means by which this was sought to be se - cured — the equalisation as between forenoon and afternoon deliveries, booauso of the burden of noting total weights of deliveries during these periods of the day. At the previous hearing their witnesses acknowledged the practicability of such a regulation. Their chief objection now is the probable added expense of one or two clerks at the Omaha flight booses. They suggested no other method for remedying the situation, aad If the regulation proposed by the Commission relieves in any con - siderable degree the existing congestion at the freight houses, the cost of recording the weights of freight delivered by each shipper will be more than offset by the saving in wages of the other freight house employees. Uniformity of delivery throughout the day is practicable only in connection with the shippers of commodities that are not perishable. As stated In the original opinion herein, such commodities are delivered largely in the afternoon in order to avoid long exposure to the weather and because the carriers make no provision for their loading until that time. The bulk of such commodities come from the packing houses located in South Omaha, and because no facilities are provided by the carriers at the South Omaha freight houses for receiving such freight, delivery is made by means of refrigerated cars loaded at the packing houses and switched to the Omaha freight houses arriving there at about 2: SO oclock p. m. The comparative volume of perishable freight la not great enough, however, to materially affect the congestion at the </seg>
            <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 527 freight house*, as it is only from ten to twelve per cent of the total volume. The Commission is satisfied, however, that the measure whereby greater uniformity in delivery was sought to be secured could be mate - rially altered. The proposed order contemplated a division of deliveries only by shippers of 10,000 pounds or more of freight in a day, without any requirement as to shippers of lesser amounts. The minimum was placed at 10,000 pounds, because it would permit of the delivery of one average drayload of 5,000 pounds before 2 o'clock p. m., and a similar de - livery after that hour. The Commission overlooked the fact that in the case of smaller shippers a ton probably constitutes a fair load for de - livery. The 10,000 pound limit brought within the purview of the rule less than one-half of the total shipments. The record does not show what proportion would be included within a 4.i)no pound limit, but inasmuch as approximately ninety per cent of the shipments are made by regular shippers it is fair to assume that the latter limit would apply to fully three-fourths of the shippers. Placing the division hour at 2 o'clock p. m. instead of at noon is by reason of the employment of the freight house force on inbound freight during the forenoons largely. The meat packing houses contended that it was impossible with the present facilities to make deliver} of individual shipments intact as to the several articles entering into them. The packing houses have no Ireight assembling rooms and it is impossible to provide them under the present emergency demands of the federal government for their products. Their facilities are now taxed to the utmost, and additions to some of their plants now under way are being seriously delayed for want of building labor. Their present practice in loading the trap cars used in the delivery of L. C. L. shipments to the Omaha freight houses is to load a truck with the product of but one of their many departments, and a single shipment is represented in as many as fifteen or twenty truckloads. The trucks are taken directly to the trap cars and unloaded without regard to consignee or destination. This results in a promiscuity of the trap carload, which is perhaps the most embarrassaing feature of the de liveries at the freight houses. The packers acknowledge, however, that it is possible to load these trap cars according to the line car into which the shipments are eventu - ally stowed at the freight houses. If this is done, it will dispose of the greater part of the trouble in unloading them at the freight houses, as it is the Ireight house loading on the trucks going to particular cars, and stowing the freight into the cars, that constitutes the bulk of the work at the freight house. The packers also contended that all packing house products should be included in the exception as to uniformity of de - liveries inasmuch as the bulk of their shipments are delivered in the trap cars, and the delivery cannot be made earlier than 2 o'clock p. m. This also applies to other shippers of perishable products for the reason that the carriers are not in position to receive such products until 11 o'clock a. m. at the earliest. The order will, therefore, be altered so as </seg>
            <seg id="p526">528 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT to Include within the exception as to uniformity of deliveries, all perish - able product*. The proposed rule will also be relaxed so as to require the delivery of shipments intact only as to the car into which they are to be loaded at the freight houses, and this will apply only to the ship - ments delivered at any one time during the day so as to permit of more than one delivery going to the same consignee during the day. And owing to the Inherent difficulty as to exactness both as to the uniformity and manner of deliveries, the rule will be made elastic enough to secure aubstantial performance only. Objection Is also made to the application of the rules as to uniformity and lntactnexa of deliveries to Qrand Island and other interior points in the state where the freight house congestion is not so great as at Omaha and Lincoln. The conditions are not sufficiently dissimilar at interior points, however, to warrant this exception, and contrary treatment would probably result in unjust discrimination. Other minor objections to the proposed regulations were assigned, but they are not of sufficient im - portance to interfere with a trial of the regulations as amended. The highest possible efficiency on the part of the carriers is the end in view. and If It develops that the rates are not promotlve of this purpose they will be altered or wholly abolished, if need be. The attention of the Commission has also been called to the fact that there are a number of minor Jobbing cities in the state that are not Included within the purview of the proposed order, and claim is made that If they are not so included, preferential treatment will be shown them to the disadvantage of the Jobbers located in the cities named. The record does not disclose any particular hardship to shippers by reason of the requirements of the order as amended, and if the order results in a more expedltioux handling ami forwarding of the freight at the stations mill a» anticipated, it will benefit jobbers affected beyond what they now enjoy. However, the fundamental nature of the instant proceeding H not one of preferential treatment or discrimination and if a measure of this evil develops as a result thereof, it cannot be held to affect the chief purpose or invalidate the regulation, at least until such time as substantial injury Is shown. The ('iiiiimisxinii. therefore, finds that it is just and reasonable to require of the carriers parties hereto that they formally receive and re - ceipt for all shipments of less than carload merchandise deposited upon the platforms or rt&lt;H&gt;rs of their respective receiving freight houses in the t-ltlea herein named up to the capacity of the cars designated by them for tans than carload loading upon the day in question, within thirty minutes after such deposit, and that they truck away such shipments from their pliittoriiix or flooro and stow the same into such cars within one hour after such deposit ; provided that preference shall be given to the receipt and handling of supplies of the federal government including war sup - piles destined for the government or any agency thereof.

It appears from the record that the production of corn in Nebraska during the year 1917 was approximately MMM.MO bushels, of which approximately 100,000,000 bushels must ultimately go to market; that the greater portion of the corn is what is termed "soft" corn, with a moisture content of from 18% to 30%, and that a considerable portion is stored upon the ground without covering of any kind and will rot unless moved to market before the warm weather of spring commences; that the movement of the 1917 crop of cor* to market has materially retarded by reason of the inferior condi - tion of the grain, and that approximately 80,000,000 bushels remains to be marketed, compared with a total movement to market of the 1916 crop of 73,000.000 bushels; that elevators in the terminal markets of Oman*. Lincoln and Fremont are equipped with facilities to dry corn, Ik* capacity of which is 117.400 bushels per day, but that these facilities Ebeen used to date at a rate of 25,000 bushels per day only; and the total elevator capacity at these markets and at Council Bluffs, i I* the destination of considerable of the Nebraska product, is in •MM of 10,000.000 bushels. The record shows further with remarkable unanimity that in order to assist in conserving the food values of soft corn it is necessary to give shippers of such corn preferential treatment if the distribution of cars, with some recognition, however, of the need of a portion of the can used in grain loading for the purpose of moving oats and wheat to market. There was some complaint that a priority order in favor of ears will deprive a few shippers of the opportunity to discharge con - tracts for the delivery of sound corn and other grains, but such probable tajury la not of sufficient importance to offset the much greater ad - vantage In conserving the corn crop. The Commission finds, therefore, that corn of a moisture content of »% and greater should have preferential treatment in the loading of can apportioned under the rules adopted herein on December 22, 1917; that tv% of the cars apportioned to regular shippers at stations other than Omaha, Lincoln and Fremont should be loaded with such corn only, and that the responsibility for such loading should be placed upon the shippers by reason of the practical impossibility of the carriers' determ - tmtag the moisture content of corn delivered to them for carriage in the •listing emergency.

SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER On January 21. 1918, an order was issued by the Nebraska State Railway Commission which sr-t forth conclusions arrived at as a result of evidence taken at a hearing held in Lincoln, January 18. 1918, which order read as follows: "IT IS ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that from January 28, 1918. to March 2, 1918, inclusive, not less than 80% of the cars apportioned to regular shippers at stations other than Omaha, Lincoln and Rulo in Nebraska under the 'Car Distribu - tion Rules' adopted by the Commission on December 22. 1917. be loaded with corn of a moisture content of 20% or greater only." Since this order was issued, further and important information and data has been filed with the Commission by the Omaha Grain Exchange and by a large number of shippers of grain in southern Neb~aska, which information has led the Commission to the conclusion that it is for the best interests of the shipping public and for the conservation of the Ne - braska corn crop that said order of January 21. 1918. be amended by re - ducing the required moisture content of corn to be shipped.

Since the Issuance of the order, however, numerous complaints as to a shortage of cars on the North Western have been received by the Com - mission. Ah a consequence the following resolution and supplemental order was adopted and issued: "WHEREAS, the Commission is in receipt of several reports that a shortage of cars available for grain and mill products loading exists on the lines of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway com- pany located in Nebraska: "BE IT RESOLVED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that an additional hearing be held in this matter at the offices of the Commission In Lincoln, Nebraska, on Friday, January 18. 1918. at ten o'clock a. m.. for the purpose of taking additional testimony as to such shortage of cars, with a view to subjecting said railway company to the operation of the rules heretofore adopted herein." In accordance with this order a hearing was had on January 18. Illl. A number of grain shippers located at points on the North West - era appeared and submitted evidence, showing that for a period of sev eral weeks and at the present time they have been and are unable to ■•cure sufflc-ient grain ears with which to move grain they have ready for shipment. Mr. F. Walters, general manager of the North Western, ad - mitted that a shortage existed for a short time, but contended that when weather conditions in the east improve that supply of cars will be greatly Increased and the shortage to a very considerable extent relieved.

There is complaint on the part of some of the shippers that the dis - tribution at the stations is not as equitable as it should be. While de - fendant has attempted at some points to apportion the cars according to the volume of business, it has no uniform rule to that effect, relying prin - cipally on the method of distribution to*the shippers in rotation. The evidence in this regard justifies the Commission in finding that a shortage of grain cars exists on the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company in this state. It follows, therefore, that the rules promulgated in the final order in this case should be made to apply to defendant. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the following rules be adopted for the apportionment and distribution of freight cars to shippers of grain and mill products by the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company at its respective stations in Nebraska, to-wit: CAR DISTRIBUTION RULES Rules promulgated by the Nebraska State Railway Commission for the apportionment and distribution of freight cars to shippers of grain and mill products in Nebraska, effective February 2, 1918. DEFINITIONS: The cars to be apportioned under these rules shall be all cars suitable for the transportation of grain and mill products which are not specifically assigned by the railroad having possession of the same for the purpose of discharging orders or rules of the Federal Government, or any of its branches, and which are not required by law for the transportation of other commodities. A "shipper" shall mean any person, firm, company, association or corporation in Nebraska offering grain or mill products in carload lots to be carried over the railroad in accordance with the provisions of the official tariffs of the carriers. Shippers shall be divided into "regular shippers" and "miscellaneous shippers." A "regular shipper" is any person, association, firm or corporation established at a station and in possession of an elevator, warehouse or mill in which grain or mill products are stored preparatory to trans - portation thereof by railroad, who has made shipments of such commo - dities in carload lots at frequent intervals from such station for one month or more immediately preceding the date of his classification. A "miscellaneous shipper" shall be every shipper of grain or mill products from a station other than a "regular shipper." Rule No. 1. Cars shall be apportioned between regular shippers as a class and miscellaneous shippers as a class at a station during the cur - rent month according to the respective numbers of carload shipments of grain and mill products originated by such classes of shippers from the station during the preceding calendar year, beginning with the year 1917. </seg>

Whenever any shipper declines or fails to accept a car apportioned to him, or fails to begin to load the same within the free period allowed for loading under the official tariffs of the carriers, he shall forfeit all right to such car and the car shall be apportioned to the next shipper entitled thereto. A car so transferred shall be counted both against the shipper refusing and the shipper accepting and loading it, in the monthly apportionment. Rule No. 6. Every railroad company shall provide each of its sta - tion agents with a book to be known as the car order book. Such book shall be properly ruled and with suitable headings and shall show (a) the name of the applicant, (b) the date of the order, (c) the date car is wanted, (d) the commodity for shipment and amount thereof, (e) the kind and capacity of car desired, and (f) the date car is furnished. Rule No. 7. Every shipper shall apply for a car or cars in his own name only, and no shipper shall apply in any one day for cars in excess of his capacity to load in one day.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: This matter was again considered by the Commission this 28th day of February, 1918. on the record, findings and orders heretofore made herein, with particular reference to the apportionment of cars between the two classes of regular and miscellaneous shippers. </seg>
            <seg id="p538">540 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT Rule No. 1 of the Car Distribution Rules takes as a basis for this apportionment the volume of shipments made by each of these classes during the preceding calendar year, which is the only basis specifically provided by legislative measure. The rule governing the distribution of ear* between regular shippers included a second factor — the amount of grain or mill products offered for shipment — and the Commission is now of the opinion that the distribution between regular and miscellaneous ■nippers should take this additional factor into account as far at practicable. It la apparent, however, that exactness cannot be secured as to the volume of grain offered for carriage by miscellaneous shippers, coming an It does from the whole country-side of stations in time of car short as*. It would be practically impossible for the Commission to check these offer* with the grain on the farm, as in the case of regular ship - per* with elevators at the station— a necessity in case of complaint. The fact, however, that miscellaneous shippers at many stations in the ■tate who are now tendering considerable grain for shipment are de - prived of any cars whatsoever under the rules because of no shipment? by this class of shippers during the year 1917 makes provision for them imperative. Tenders of freight to railroads for transportation cannot be wholly disregarded. This provision must necessarily be more or less arbitrary under the circumstances and more or less of an experiment, for reasons previously stated. The allotment of one car out of every ten to miscellaneous ship - per* would be a substantial provision at least, and is adopted until more definite data is secured. The Commission therefore finds that ten per cent of the cars apportioned for grain and mill products loading at the nation* In Nebraska of the railroad parties to this investigation are reasonably required to carry such products offered for carriage by mis - cellaneous shippers where the preceding year's shipments by such ship pers at the station do not entitle them to a greater percentage. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com mission that Rule No. 1 of the Car Distribution Rules heretofore adopted herein be amended to read as follows: Rule No. 1. Cars shall be apportioned between regular shippers as a class and miscellaneous shippers as a class at a station during the current month according to the respective numbers of carload shipments of train and mill products originated by such classes of shippers from the station during the preceding calendar year, beginning with the year 1917. When the carload shipments originated by miscellaneous shippers at the station during the preceding calendar year do not equal 10% of all of the carload shipments of grain and mill products from the station during said year, not less than 10% of the cars ■hall be apportioned to miscellaneous shippers, provided application is made therefor In the order book in time to make such apportion inent. A major fraction of a car shall be counted as one car in the apportionment; and where there are no regular shippers at a station </seg>

HISTORY The Commission entered an order in the above cause tinder date of January 2, 1917, said order appearing on pages 165 to 167, inclusive, of the Tenth Annual Report. Defendant appealed to the Supreme Court from the Commission's order, which court rendered the following opinion under date of May 4, 1918, reversing said order of the Commission. The text of the Supreme Court's decision follows: SYLLABUS The federal government being in control of the railroads of the country as a war measure, state courts and administrative tribunals should consider the general welfare in adjusting between private suitors controversies involving the expenditure of railroad funds for the im - provement of local transportation facilities. ROSE, J. The Nebraska State Railway Commission ordered defendant to pro - vide at the village of Ralston a station and other shipping facilities near the intersection of Seventy-seventh street and the Missouri Pacific Rail way track. The case is presented here upon an appeal by defendant. Three-fourths of a mile from the industrial part of Ralston defend - ant has a building and a team track. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company has a station at the village itself, where three em - ployes are engaged in the railway service. The sufficiency of existing shipping facilities and the necessity for improvements were controverted issues. On appeal the decision of the Nebraska State Railway Commission is challenged as unreasonable. The order was made before the United States engaged in the present war. As a military measure the federal government is now controlling defendant's railway system. The enforce - ment of the order challenged on appeal will require labor, materials and money. Owing to the exigencies of war the government is making extra- </seg>
            <seg id="p542">544 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT ordinary demands for funds, men, materials and railroad equipment. De fendant's lines of railroad transportation are connecting links between a granary of the nation and millions of men now engaged in the common defense. In this emergency the general welfare should.be considered In adjusting between private suitors controversies involving expenditure for the Improvement of local railroad facilities. When the order was made there was no occasion or opportunity to present or consider these features of the questions presented by the appeal. The new situation grew out of facts requiring the judicial notice of the appellate court. The Nebraska State Railway Commission should have an opportunity for further inquiry in view of changed conditions. To that end, following Marshall v. Bush, 102 Neb. , 167 N. W. 59, the order challenged by defendant is vacated and the proceeding remanded to the Nebraska State Railway Commission for further consideration. Reversed and Remanded.

Appeal was taken to the Supreme Court on November 8, 1916. A de cision was rendered, setting aside the order of the Commission. March 16, 1918. SYLLABUS 1. Ordinarily the discomforts, dangers and inconveniences con - nected with the transportation of passengers upon freight trains requires separate trains for the carriage of freight and livestock and for the car riage. of passengers. 2. It may become necessary in order to furnish proper service thai a railroad company be required to operate a branch line at a loss. 3. An order of a railway commission requiring a railroad company to furnish separate trains for freight and passenger service is not prima facie unreasonable, but if it is shown that the installation of a separate passenger train would render the operation of the branch line unre - munerative and it is conceded that both passenger and freight business within the state do not pay expenses and that the whole interstate sys- ;em is in the hands of a receiver on account of inability to pay fixed charges, such order may violate the due process clause of the Con - stitution. 4. The court will take judicial notice that a state of war exists and that Congress has placed in the hands of the government the direction nnd operation of the railroads of the country. The Missouri Pacific Railway company operates a line of railroad from Omaha to Kansas City and St. Louis. In Nebraska the road runs southward. At the station of Talmage a branch runs westward to Crete upon the main line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad com - pany. The length of this branch is 59 miles. The towns intervening be - tween Crete and Talmage have a total population of 1,911. At Hickman a line of the Union Pacific Railroad company and a main line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company cross the Missouri Pacific. The lines of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad com - pany nearly parallel the branch under consideration, one about six miles to the north and one about six miles to the south of it. These lines both enter the city of Lincoln, as do the Union Pacific line spoken of, and the main line of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway com - pany which crosses this branch near the town of Sprague. The branc"i passes through a rich and well settled agricultural region, but probably largely on account of the fact that the line reaches no city or large town, and so many other lines nearby do afford such access there has been very little passenger traffic, people living along the line at pointr, not reached by other railroads usually driving six or eight miles to r- north or south to reach the line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quine;, Railroad company. An informal petition was filed with the Nebraska State Railway Commission by a number of citizens of Panama, Auburn, Cook, Douglar </seg>
            <seg id="p544">546 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT and the vicinity requesting better passenger service on this branch. The defendant at this time was operating a mixed freight and passenger train each day over this branch, daily except Sunday. The answer set forth in substance that the railroad company was now in the hands of a receiver, that it is an interstate carrier; that it has annually since 190 &lt; suffered a deficit on its total business in Nebraska, the net deficit since 1909 to 1916, inclusive, varying from $85,000 to nearly $300,000, and that under the Nebraska two-cent fare act, it is compelled to transport pas sengers at an actual loss. After a hearing an order was made by the Commission that a pas - senger train be operated daily except Sunday but giving the defendant the option to make its freight service triweekly. An application m aftervards made by the defendant to set aside this order and allov I'uither testimony to be taken. This was done, and after the hearing the Commission found that by reason of the nature of the freight traffic it was necessary to schedule freight trains on this branch so as to make connection with the stock train on the main line from Kansas City to Auburn; that it is impossible to do this and to make connection \vi any passenger trains on the main line or with passenger trains on tin - lines of the Burlington running to Lincoln; that it is impossible to knov what the passenger traffic would be if adequate passenger trains were operated making connections at junction points. It was ordered that the defendant install and operate upon this branch a passenger train each way daily except Sunday. From this order defendant appeals. LETTON, J. Four errors are assigned. 1. That the evidence does not sustain ihe order of the Commission as to inadequacy of service. 2. That thi&gt; trains required cause an unreasonable burden to be placed upon th&lt; interstate business of defendant. 3. That the receipts from the opera - ticn of the trains would be so light compared with the expense of opera - tion as to be confiscatory. 4. That the order is unreasonable, denii - the equal protection of the law to the railroad company and deprives i of its property without due process of law. By the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in the cases of Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co. v. Public Service Commission. 242 U. S. 603: Wisconsin, M. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, 179 U. S. 287, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115: Atlantic C. L. R. Co. v. North Carolina Corporation Commission, 20C U. 8. 1, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585; and Missouri P. R. Co. v. State of Kansas* 216 D. S. 262, the following principles seem to be definitely established. By the acceptance of a charter which confers upon it the power of eminent domain and other valuable privileges a railroad company as - sumes certain duties. It must exercise the functions for which it was organized, and in consideration of which the privileges were conferred. Under the statute of 1866, in force until 1913, railroad corporation* were required to "furnish sufficient accommodations for the transportation of passengers and freight," and it was required also that every euch cor - poration "shall take, transport and discharge all passengers to and from such stations as the trains stop at, from or to all places and stations </seg>
            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 547 upon their said road, on the due payment of fare or freight bill." Rev. St. 1866. ch. 25, sec. 121 (Ann. St. 1911, sec. 10596). They were also made liable in damages for refusal to transport any property or pas senger. Rev. St. 1866, ch. 25, sec. 122 (Rev. St. 1913, sec. 6059). Long before the defendant railroad company entered the state these provisions, which really are merely declaratory of the common law, imposed fixe duties upon every railroad corporation seeking to do business in the mate and defendant by accepting the benefits of the statute assumed the burdens imposed thereby. Railroads are public highways and the right and duty of the government to regulate the conduct and business of rail - road corporations have been founded on that fact. In relation to all highways the duty of regulation is governmental in its nature. It i' because they are exercising a governmental function that the power of eminent domain is given to them. But the government cannot require a railroad corporation to carry on the duties imposed by its acceptance of its charter and at the same time by the imposition of unreasonable and confiscatory rates deprive it of its property without due process of law. There is a distinction, however, between imposing the duty of serv - ice and the regulation of rates. It may become necessary in order i" furnish proper service as required under the charter that a railroad com - pany be required to operate a branch line at a loss or to furnish certtv'' other service for less than actual cost. It is also true that the nature and extent of the existing facilities furnished by a railroad compan; must be considered in determining whether a requirement that such facilities be increased is Just and reasonable. If it were shown that '! • enforcement of the order would so affect the general scheme of th^ operation of the entire system that it would inevitably require its opera - tion at a loss, then the order might be considered so unreasonable as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. U. S. Const. Chesapeake &amp; C. R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 242 U. S. 603, 37 Sup. Ct. Rep. 234. Ordinarily the known discomforts, disadvantages, dangers and annoy - ances connected with the transportation of passengers upon freight trains require separate trains for the carriage of freight and livestock and for the carriage of passengers. A full discussion of this point may be found in People v. St. Louis, A. &amp; T. R. R. Co., 176 111. 512, 35 L. R. A 656, and in Missouri P. R. Co. v. State of Kansas, 218 IT. S. 262, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 836. We agree with the doctrine of these cases. The legisla - ture of Nebraska has evidently taken the same view, as it has provided in the act specifying the necessary equipment to be placed upon gasolinr motor cars or gasoline trains (Laws 1909, ch. 97) that the State Railway Commission shall have the power to release any railway company from such requirement "on new roads where steam passenger trains have not been regularly run, until such time as the business will warrant better service, also on parts of roads where at least one steam passenger train ' :it* iun, which niukex regular slops at least six days in the week; pro - vided, mixed freight and passenger trains shall not be considered pas - senger trains." Rev. St. 1913, sec. 5986. Prima facie, therefore, an order requiring proper facilities to be furnished passengers is reasonable. It </seg>
            <seg id="p546">548 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT a ie shown that the expense of operating this train will amount to more than $22,000 a year. It la very doubtful whether the operation of a pas - senger train will pay expenses for many years unless defendant r allowed to increase its rates. It is clear it will not be presently re - munerative. The mere fact that the rendition of a certain class of serv - ice by a railroad company may be unremunerative is not sufficient to relieve it from the duty of furnishing the same. Cram v. Chicago, B. . Q. R. Co., 84 Neb. 607; Davison v. Chicago &amp; N. W^ R. Co., 100 Neb. 462. As pointed out in Atlantic C. L. R. Co. v. North Carolina Corporation Commission, 206 U S. 1, and in Missouri P. R. Co. v. State of Kansas. 216 U. S. 262, there is a distinction between requiring service to be per - formed upon a portion of a railroad system at a loss, and the fixing of schedule of rates for transportation so unreasonably low as to require the whole system to be operated at conflscatory rates. In the one case the loss incidental to the operation of a portion of the system in the prescribed manner may be met by a readjustment of train service r other economies on other parts of the system, whereas inadequate rates applying to the whole system must inevitably result in a form of con fiscation forbidden by the Constitution of the United States. Smyth v. Ames. 169 U. S. 466, 526; Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co. v. Public Service Com - mission, 242 U. S. 603. 37 Sup. Ct. Rep. 234. It is undisputed that the returns from the operation of defendant's lines in Nebraska are not com - pensatory, it seems to be conceded that being unable to pay the interest on its bonded debt and other charges the corporation is in the hands ol a receiver, and that the whole system is unremunerative. These condi - tions defendant insists bring the case within the principles of Smyth v. Ames, supra. If the defendant were at liberty to raise its rates to cover the increased cost of operation, this argument would have no force, b it has been decided that, the legislature having fixed the rates, the State Railway Commission was without power to alter them. State v. Clarke 98 Neb. 566. It would be a violation of the statute if the defendant did so. Since the rendition of the order complained of a condition has arisen of which the court is justified in taking judicial notice. The country is now in a state of war and the government of the United States ha:' assumed control over the operation of the railroads. There is a de - ficiency in motive power and of cars, and a shortage of men. To talr the necessary engines and rolling stock to operate this train may de crease to that extent the facilities of defendant for the patriotic duty which is imposed upon it of doing everything possible to meet the de mands in the transportation field imposed by the new conditions. With - out deciding that the order was unreasonable when made — though in clined to so hold — we are reluctant to sustain it under these circum stances. We have concluded that the order should remain in abeyano&lt; until an opportunity is given to the Railway Commission to consider how far the order may impinge upon the powers given by Congress to th&lt; Director General of Railways over the operation of the railroads during the war. and whether under the present conditions the order should noi </seg>

SYLLABUS A state railway commissioner, holding office under the constitution - al amendment (Const. Art. 5, par. 19A) creating the state railway com - mission, is not required to give an official bond. DEAN, J. This is an original action in the nature of quo warranto brought in this court by relator in the name of the state, by permission of the Attorney General, to oust defendant from the office of state railway commissioner for failure to give an official bond. Defendant was elected for a six-ye^r term, beginning in January, 1915, and ending in January' 1921. It is admitted that no bond was given. It is argued by defend - ant that a bond cannot be lawfully required. That is the sole question for decision in this case. When the Constitution became operative in 1S75, article 5 enumer - ated the then elective executive officers of the state, fixing their terms of office, salaries and the like. Section L'5 of that article provides: "The officers mentioned in this article shall give bonds in not less than double the amount of money that may come into their hands and in no case less than the sum of $50,000, with such provi - sions as to sureties and the approval thereof and for the increase of the penalty of such bonds as may be prescribed by law." Relator bases his argument in large part on the requirements found i:i section 25. The state railway commission was created by a Constitutional amendment that was adopted November fi. 1906. The amendment fol - lows: NOW, THEREFORE. Ihe said cause b; remanded to you, in order that such proceedings may be had therein as according to right and justice and the laws of the state of Nebraska ought to be had. WITNESS. The Hon.

Of the three commissioners first elected the one receiving the highest number of votes shall hold his office for six years, the next highest four years, and the lowest two years. The powers and duties of such commission shall include th.9 regula - tion of rates, service and general control of common carriers, as the legislature may provide by law. But in t:ie absence of specific legis - lation the Commission shall exercise the powei » and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." The amendment appeared in the Seraloa Laws of 1907, 1909 and 1911 and in the Compiled Statutes and in Cobbey's Annotated Statutes for those years immediately following the boilv of the Constitution, as an unnumbered and separate ue.iion of that Instrument. In th&lt;3 Session Laws of 1913 and in the Revised question first appeared in article and it has appeared in the sa-n Session Laws of 1915 and 1917. Stitutes for 1&amp;13 the amendment m &gt; of the Constitution as Section 19A, relative position in the succeeding By the amendment being placed in article 5 it is hereby made to appear, by section 25 of that article that I he railway commissioners must give bonds. Relator says that the amendment was incorporated in article 5 of the Constitution by the code commission in pursuance of Section 3719, Rev. St. 1913, namely: "The Constitution, with amendments, of Nebraska and of the United States, and the Declaration of Independence shall be incor - porated in the statutes in such part thereof as the commission deems best." It is also said by relator that the code commission very properly placed the amendment in article 5 because that article has to do with executive officers, and he says the functions of the railway commission are executive. It is sufficient answer to say that the people did not place the amendment there. The legislature had no power to place the amendment there nor in any article of the organic law that might cause its meaning to be misconstrued or that would even seem to change its legal effect. Much less could the legislature delegate such exercise of power to the code commission. Relator points out that the amendment creating the "board of com - missioners of state institutions" took the place and section number of former section 19, article 5, of the Constitution. But that section was expressly proposed, by a joint legislative resolution, as an amendment to "section 19 of article five (5) of the Constitution," and of course it follows that upon its adoption it would appear as section 19. Laws 1911, c. 225. That amendment is also different in another important respect from the one involved here in that it expressly and in direct terms provides that the members composing the board "shall each give bonds." </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 553 There are no such provisions respecting the railway commission amendment. That amendment was not proposed by the legislature as a substitute lor any specific section of the organic law. Laws 1905, c. 233. It was adopted by the people as a separate amendment, and, unlike the amendment that created "the board of commissioners of state institu - tions," it does not even by implication require a state railway commis - sioner to give an official bond. For the reasons appearing herein, we decline to hold that under the Constitution an incumbent of the office of state railway commissioner is required to give an official bond. The writ is denied and the action dismissed. ROSE, J., not sitting. State of Nebraska ex rel George W. Shields, Relator, vs. Harry G. Taylor, Defendant.

            <seg id="p552">554 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT PART V. Department of Securities To the Commission During 1918, the department has continued the policy of stricter enforcement of the Blue Sky law adopted early in 1917 after the Supreme Court of the United States had upheld such laws in Michigan. Ohio an'l South Dakota, similar in many points to the Nebraska law. However, the Nebraska law. as passed, was in poor form, involved and with seem ingly conflicting provisions. The Commission went ahead and did the best that it could with the law it had at hand. It was aware that much stock selling was going on in Nebraska which appeared, at least in spirit. to be illegal, but at the same time enough under color of law that there appeared much question whether such sales could be reached through the machinery of the criminal law. The Commission sought to have friendly test suits instituted to test out the law and to get a ruling from the Supreme Court of the state as to the meaning of some doubtful pas sages of the law, but was met with refusals each time. So it had to gel along as best it could, depending upon the county attorneys, the officers authorized under the general law, to enforce the criminal law. Since Attorney General Reed had at least permitted it to be given out quite generally that the law was absolutely unconstitutional, it was a difficult matter to get the county attorneys of the state generally to take much interest in the enforcement of the Blue Sky law in their several com - munities, and for that reason much illegal selling took place in the state during the year. In the fall of 1917. Mr. George A. Magney. county attorney of Doug - las county, had caused a complaint to be filed against one Don E. DeBow. charging him with the violation of the Blue Sky law in selling stocks to one Edward S. Guyor. The stock involved was in the nature of plots of ground twenty feet square in Pittsburg county. Oklahoma, but which carried with them proportionate shares in all oil or gas found upon the whole tract and all leases held or to be held by the Farmers Oil &amp; Gas company in Oklahoma and Kansas. DeBow had been bound over from the police court of the city of Omaha, had attacked the constitutionality of the law and the sufficiency of the complaint, both by an action of habeas corpus and demurrer before Judge Sears in the District Court of Douglas county, and the law had been held constitutional and the com - plaint sufficient and the sales as sales of stock made under the law. In March, 1918. the case came on for trial before Judge Redick of the court, and It was again held that the complaint was sufficient and the sales of the so-called lots sales of stock within the purview of the law. How - ever, upon the introduction of evidence upon behalf of the state. Guyor testified that he was himself a dealer in securities, and the court held since Gnyor was the state's witness, his statement was sufficient proof, and that the particular sale was. therefore, within an express exemption ot the law and, therefore, DeBow could not be held. Through an ovor </seg>
            <seg id="p553">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 555 (tight in the office of County Attorney Maguey, appeal was not perfected in time. AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES Thereupon DeBow brought an action in the District Court of Lan - caster county asking $50,000 damages against the three commissioners, Hugh LaMaster, attorney for the Commission, and E. S. Ripley, the examiner, upon the theory of false imprisonment and malicious prose - cution. That case was recently heard for five days, whereupon the court instructed the jury to bring in a verdict for the defendants, using the following language: "Gentlemen: In the trial of a law suit, the court passes upon the legal phases, and the jury upon the questions of fact. Where the questions of fact are indisputably established so that there would be no difference of opinion on what the evidence showed, then it is the duty of the court to apply the law to those facts as they are found. Now, under our so-called Blue Sky law this company and the plaintiff here were not allowed to sell stock in Nebraska with - out getting a permit from the Railway Commission. The commis - sioners, the defendants in this case, were authorized, and it was their duty under the law, to enforce the Blue Sky law. The plain - tiff here was selling what he termed tracts of land, but those tracts of land 20 feet square were no more than shares in this company. Now, the defendants made an investigation and they sent a man down to Oklahoma and they looked this all over, and the evidence that was presented to them and to any reasonable man would show that this company was engaged not only in an unlawful business of selling shares of stock, but that the shares of stock, or the manner in which they were sold and the maner of conducting the company, was to a certain degree of a fraudulent character. It was not only the duty of the commissioners to do as they did, but they would have been derelict in their duty if they had not brought prosecution against this plaintiff. In bringing the prosecution they made a mis - take in charging him with a sale to Mr. Guyor, Mr. Guyor being a dealer in securities, and being a man who sold securities himself, the law made it an exception, so that when the plaintiff sold to Mr. Guyor it was not violating the law, and that was the reason this case was brought. When the charge was made in Omaha, and they tried the case up there, it developed that Mr. Guyor was a dealer, and therefore, the plaintiff was not guilty and his case was dis - missed. He then brings the action for malicious prosecution against these officers. They are bound in prosecuting anyone to make an investigation, and after they had made the investigation, if they be - lieve that the man is guilty, that is a complete defense. If they do not have reasonable ground to believe, or there is some element lacking, then in order that they be guilty, it must have been mali - cious, or a malicious prosecution, that is where the defendants mali - ciously brought a suit in order to injure the plaintiff. Every time a county attorney looses a criminal suit, you cannot allow the defend - ant to turn around and sue him and get damages, but you can only hold a law enforcing officer where there is a lack of probable cause, and where it is malicious. Now, the motive here in prosecuting was without any dispute an effort on the part of the Railway Commission to enforce the law and to suppress the sales of this oil stock, and their motive is unquestioned in this case, and it is not in any sense of the word a malicious prosecution, and therefore, the order of the </seg>
            <seg id="p554">556 ELEVENTH ANNUAL REP ORT court is that the jury return a verdict for the defendants, and I will ask you. Mr. Clark, as foreman, to sign the verdict for the de - fendants." Late in the year it was decided to test out the power o£ the Com - mission under the law by bringing some civil cases, and in December the Commission brought actions against the Alfalfa Butter company and the Painless Withers Dental company in the District Court of Douglas county. The right to bring such actions was vigorously attacked and in the first case a demurrer to the petition has been sustained, apparently the court holding that after one year the Commission had no jurisdic - tion. Doubtless an appeal will be taken. In the second case mentioned the court has not yet indicated its ruling on the demurrer filed. A de - cision in the Supreme Court of the state on these matters should do much to clarify the air and determine what powers the Commission has under the Blue Sky law. The Capital Gold Mining &amp; Milling company, originally incorporated in South Dakota, but dormant for a number of years, and conducting no mining operations, but with an office in Omaha where stock of one dol - lar per share was sold, went into the Federal District Court of Nebraska, Omaha division, when the Commission refused to make a finding holding that the company was exempt from the operation of the Nebraska Blue Sky law, and sought to enjoin the Commission, but the court found them not entitled to an injunction. I have gone into these matters somewhat in detail to indicate some of the matters the department has had to meet in attempting to enforce the Blue Sky law and the difficulties it has had to overcome to accom - plish anything. But in spite of the great uncertainty of the law and the difficulties in the way of the enforcement of same, much real good has been accomplished, for a great many companies, after a brief conference with the department decide to confine their operations to states other than Nebraska, and many particularly undesirable companies, learning of the methods of enforcing the law, steer clear of the state. On the other hand many of the applicants have been assisted in getting their corporate affairs straightened out and in better shape, and have found that the department offered a real service.

These valuations connected with deflectograph studies showing the relative we: r on the tack caused by passenger trains as compared with freight trains have t;.ken much of the time of this department, in preparation for rate cases pending in the Federal Court. The inv stigations of the telephone properties which appear below have not been classified as between stocks and bonds and rates and ser - vice. Some of ihese investigations called for appraisements which were used in connection with applications for authority to issue additional cap - ital and others were used in conneotion with applications for increases in rates. At the sam.' time, in some instances, service investigations were conductetl in ori'.er that all of ihe facts concerning each property might be before the Commission. /■■ In the folio 1 , inp list of telephone companies the Red Cloud Telephone System involved *\w appraisement of two telephone properties and a con - solidation stiu.. showing the value of these properties after they were combined in one system. •" TELEPHONE COMPPANIES Red Cloud Telephone System.
