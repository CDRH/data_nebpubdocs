            <seg id="p005">FOREWORD The Nebraska Unemployment Compensation Division had as its major objective in 1938 the preparation of a program that would assure the prompt and accurate payment of benefits to eligible claimants after January 1, 1939. The normal function of the Division during the year was tin- collection ofi quarterly contributions from Nebraska em - ployers, subject to the Law, based on wages paid to covered workers. The accurate crediting of individual wage records to each covered worker and the proper accounting of contributions to the individual reserve accounts of each subject employer was the principal work of the Division during 1938. During the year, $133,778.26 was expended for administra - tion, flic entire sum of which was granted to Nebraska from the Social Security Board. Audits of the administrative expense records of the Division are conducted at periodic intervals by the Social Security Board staff. Expenditures and budgets are thus rigidly surveyed. Continuous studies are being made tending toward simpli - fying the administration of the present law, with the aim of facilitating payment of benefits and reducing administrative expense. MERIT EXAMINATIONS Early in the year the Advisory Committee on Personnel th numb its Supervisor of Examinations, Dr. E. Glenn fallen, con - ducted a series otj written and oral examinations. The purpose of these examinations was to establish registers of personnel based mi merit examinations as set forth in the Unemployment Com - pensation Law. Following the written and oral examinations registers of I,7Bl 'applicants were established, and all adminis - trative persons at present employed by the Unemployment Com - pensation Division in permanent or temporary positions, exclu - sive of the Director, have been appointed from the eligible posi - tions on these registers. During December, 1938. the Division had 10 1 employees on its payroll. However, a number of these employees were added temporarily to take care of the peak load of benefit claims which is expected during the first three months of 1939. I EMPLOYERS CO-OPEKATING Nebraska employers in general are to be complimented on the promptness with which they supplied the Division with the 2 </seg>
            <seg id="p006">necessary quarterly reports of payrolls and contributions. The response was so general, in fact, that the percentage of con - tribution delinquencies of 1.32 approached a very favorable minimum. BENEFIT SECTION About August 1, the Benefit Section began to function. A Chief of Benefits was appointed. Several assistants and neces - sary stenographers carried on the work of this section until December 1, when the skeleton staff was enlarged sufficiently to prepare for the start of benefit payments on January 1, 1939. The principal work of the Benefit Section during the five' months of 1938, following its organization, consisted largely of drafting procedures and forms which would facilitate the hand - ling of claims with dispatch and accuracy. Much valuable in - formation was gathered from other states which had been pay - ing benefits during the early months of 1938. On December 1, a full staff of claims deputies was appointed. These deputies immediately began an 'intensive training period which lasted until Christmas, when they were assigned to duties at the headquarters of the Division in Lincoln, or in the field offices of the Nebraska State Employment Service. Meanwhile, a series of staff conferences was necessary in order to properly coordinate the work of the Unemployment Compensation Division and the Nebraska State Employment Service, which under the Nebraska Law has the responsibility of taking all claims for benefits. These staff meetings were very beneficial and due to the splendid cooperation of the Ne - braska State Employment Service and its Director. Mr. Harry Bane, the work of these two divisions of the Nebraska State Department of Labor was co-ordinated so that claims for benefits could be cared for properly. Since Nebraska's Law contains specific provisions for fur - nishing information regarding benefit payments to public agen - cies concerned with the administration of work relief, the Divi - sion held several conferences with Federal W. P. A. officials am! with the State Assistance Department in order to work out needed procedures. EDUCATIONAL MEETINGS Early in September the Division began a state-wide program of education with the objective of properly informing employers, covered workers, and the general public as to important features of the Nebraska Unemployment Compensation Law. As the 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p007">4 month of January was approached, this program was centered upon benefit payment procedures. During the month of December a series of seventeen educa - tional meetings was sponsored by the Unemployment Compen - sation Division in conjunction with the Social Security Board. The Nebraska State Employment Service cooperated in arrange - ments for these meetings which were held in the larger centers of employment within the State. Splendid public response was accorded these meetings, and representatives of key industries in the State together with representatives of labor and of the gen - eral public were in attendance. An educational pamphlet explaining the benefit provisions of the Law and stressing eligibility requirements of claimants and the proper procedure to follow in filing claims for benefits was widely distributed throughout the State. PREPARE FOR BENEFIT PAYMENT The staff of the Division worked strenuously during the closing months of 1938 in order to be ready for the payment of benefits after January 1, 1939. Employees of the Unemploy - ment Compensation Division will be located at some twenty key points over the State wherever local offices of the Nebraska State Employment Service exist. Adequate preparation having been made, the Unemployment Compensation Division was prepared to care for the peak load of benefit claims which will be filed during January, 1939. ADVISORY COUNCIL The Division appreciates the help that was secured during the past year from the State Advisory Council, which is com - posed of representatives of industry, labor, and the public. In the administration of unemployment compensation, questions of policy arise that affect the various groups interested in the operation of the law. The State Advisory Council was very cooperative ami helpful in offering suggestions and recommen - dations to the Division in connection with the formulation of ad - ministrative policy. Respectfully submitted, It. T. Malone, Director UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION DIVISION </seg>
            <seg id="p008">COST OF ADMINISTRATION During the calendar year 1938. $133,778.26 was expended for administrative purposes. The entire amount of this money was received in the form of grants from the Federal Govern - ment through the Social Security Board in accordance with Title 111 of the Social Security Act. During 1938, $119,774.29 was received from the Social Se - curity Board in the form of grants, and $26,487.54 was received in the form of reallotments.

This is true principally in three industry groups â service, including hotels, furnished rooms, etc., transportation other than interstate railroads, and construction. The amount of contributions received during 1938 and dur - ing each calendar quarter of 1938 from each industry subject to the Unemployment Compensation Law is shown in Table 7.

            <seg id="p022">SUBJECT EMPLOYERS With respect to the number of employers subject to the Ne - braska Unemployment Compensation Law, 348 were added from January 1 through December 31, 1938. During the same period there was an increase of 457 in the number of accounts main - tained by the Division for reporting purposes. The increase in the number of subject employers is attributed in part to em - ployers electing coverage under the Law. and to the fact that the list of subject employers was gradually completed during the year by field and coverage work.'

These reports covered the earnings of covered workers during â Several District Court decisions relating to the determination "f liability under the Nebraska Unemployment Compensation Law were made during the year. In the case, Interstate Live Stock Commission Co. vs. Kinney, the District Court of Lancaster County held that the provision of the law permitting an employer to be held liable on the basis of employment in the preceding calendar year did not apply to 1936. In Kinney vs. Sanitary Towel Co.. Inc., the District Court of Douglas County refused to declare the controlling interest clause |48-702(g&gt;(4) 1 invalid. 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p023">the months of January. February, and March, 1938. The Unem - ployment Compensation Law provides that the first base period with respect to payment of benefits shall begin January 1, 1933. In order, therefore, to have available the necessary wage infor - mation at the time of benefit operations, the Division requested wage reports listing the Social Security account number, the name of the worker, quarterly earnings, and wage rate informa - tion for all covered workers. The workers' wage reports received from subject employers for the fourth calendar quarter 1938 included a listing of 147,424 wage items. RULES AND REGULATIONS The Commissioner, after public hearing and publication, promulgated two General Rules during 1938 that related to benefit payments. These rules are designated as a part of Series II of general rules and arc as follows: Rule Title 111 Part-Time Workers IV Charging of Benefits Against Several Employers During 1938, the Commissioner of Labor also issued a series of regulations regarding benefit operations and payments, which were effective January 1, 1939. These regulations, other than Regulation No. 11, are also a part of Series 11. Benefit Regulation No. Title 1 Claims and Registrations for All Individuals Claiming Benefits for Total Unemployment Except Those Covered by Benefit Regulations 2 and 3 2 Claims and Registrations for Individuals Located in Areas Served by Itinerant Service 3 Claims and Registrations for Individuals Affected by a Mass Separation, or by a Strike, Lockout or Other Labor Dispute 4 Forms Prescribed for Recording Claims for Benefits and Registrations for Work for Total Unemployment 5 Separation Notices 6 Payment of Benefits to Multi-State Workers 7 Interested Parties 8 Appeals to Appeal Tribunals 9 Determination of Full-Time Weekly Wage 10 Weeks of Unemployment and Weeks of Disqualification 11 Disqualification for Benefits 20 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">MERIT EXAMINATIONS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL In accordance with the regulations for the merit system and personnel administration promulgated by the Commissioner of Labor in October, 1937 and pursuant, to the provisions of the Nebraska Unemployment Compensation Law, written and oral examinations were held during January, February, and March of 1938 to establish registers. From a total of G.055 applications for examination received by the Supervisor of Examinations, 1.781 names' were placed on the registers after passing the pre - scribed examinations. The number of persons appearing on the registers varied from 472 on the Junior Clerk register to two oii the Chief of Research and Statistics register. The official regis - ters and records of the examinations are kept by the Supervisor of Examinations at his office, Wesleyan University, Lincoln Nebraska. The registers were officially established on April 1. 1938 The original registers established at that date, based on the pre - scribed examinations, were as follows: 2 â Number on br&gt;JÂ»lr,S Original Register Register Clerical Junior Clerk 470 Intermediate Clerk 165 Senior Clerk 1 23 Junior Clerk-Typist .320 Junior Clerk-Stenographer .21 1 Intermediate Clerk-Stenographer 63 Senior Clerk-Stenographer lti Junior Duplicating Machine Operator , 17 Key Punch Operator jo Senior Tabulating Machine Operator . 7 Supervisor of Tabulating Unit .. ... 3 Legal Junior Attorney 1 4 General Counsel '.'.',['â,', 7 g in lSS^ EinSSSiF * y aS S 21 </seg>

Upon recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Personnel, the Supervisor of Examinations established regis - ters for the three classifications by using the names of persons on certain original registers.' For purposes of establishing registers for Chief of Benefits, Appeals Referee, and Claims Deputy, the Supervisor of Examinations used original registers of Chief Accountant. General Counsel, Chief Unemployment Compensation Field Adviser, Junior Attorney, Unemployment Compensation Field Adviser, and Junior Accountant. With respect to the merit examinations, establishment of the registers, and the selection of the temporary staff, the Ad - visory Committee on Personnel in its first report to the Com - missioner of Labor set forth the following conclusions: "You are to be commended on the care with which you selected the temporary staff pending the establishment of registers based on merit examinations. A large number of these persons earned very satisfactory grades in the exam - inations, and are being continued in the Division. "The Committee has much evidence for its contention that a substantial and representative type of Nebraska citizen participated in the examinations and secured places on the registers of eligibles. Your Committee is convinced that you may be assured of an efficient personnel for po - sitions in the Division." 1 â It should be pointed out that this is not the number of different persons appearing on the registers inasmuch as one person may be eligible for atroolm - ment from more than one register.

            <seg id="p026">COVERED EMPLOYMENT AND PAYROLLS The Unemployment Compensation Division requests a quar - terly (calendar) report from all employers in the State of Ne - braska who are subject to the provisions of the Nebraska Unem - ployment Compensation Law. The report is designed to furnish total quarterly wage information for contribution purposes, and detailed quarterly wage information for each worker included on the payroll during the calendar quarter. As a part of the contribution section of the employer report, information is requested for each calendar month. This informa - tion includes the number of covered workers employed in the last pay periods of all types ending within the month, and the amount of wages payable in all pay periods ending in the month. These reports permit practically complete coverage with respect to employment- and payrolls in those industries included under the provisions of the Nebraska Unemployment Compensation Law. Firms in covered industries that are exempt because of the size-of-firm provisions of the Law are not represented in the employment and pay-roll data compiled from these reports'. The total volume of covered employment and -'amount of wages for covered workers based on the calendar quarterly re - ports is shown in Table 9. The chart on the opposite page shows the monthly fluctuations in the volume of covered employment and amount of covered payrolls unadjusted for seasonal variation and using as a base of 100 the average monthly employment and payrolls for the year 1937. It should be noted that employment during 1938 in general was on a lower level than for 1937. but that encouraging gains were made during the latter part of the year. Losses in employment and wages during 1938 were ex - perienced in all industries ; the most severe losses, however, were felt by workers engaged in transportation, manufacturing, and construction. The unusual increase in payrolls for the month of Decem - ber, 1938 was attributed to the payment of year-end bonuses, salaries, and gratuities. This increase in payrolls was recorded in every major industry except interstate railroads. 23 </seg>

            <seg id="p031">EMPLOYMENT AND PAYROLLS BY INDUSTRY In Appendix A to the report is shown the volume of tmiploy - ment and amount of payrolls for each month of 1938 by indus - trial classification. Table 11 shows the employment each month, and the average for the entire year; Table 12 shows the amount of payrolls for each month, and the average for the year. The classification by industry is based on the classification of the Social Security Board, March 15, 1937 Revision. Included in Appendix A is also a subclassifieation of food manufacturing. Food manufacturing in Nebraska is the largest manufacturing .industry, and includes a number of unrelated manufacturing processes. Table 13 of Appendix A shows the monthly indexes of employment of industries included in the classification "Food Manufacturing" of Table 11. using the monthly average of 1937 as 100. The detailed data for individual industries are presented in this report for the purpose of permitting employers to compare their trend in employment and payrolls with that of the entire industry as well as making available industrial employment and payroll data to those persons interested in the field of unem - ployment compensation and labor. The data presented includes only the employment in the State of Nebraska that is covered by the Nebraska Unemployment Compensation Law. Firms in a covered industry that are excluded from the Law because of the si/.e-of-firm exclusion, less than eight employees, are not rep - resented in the data. During the coming year, the Division plans to make further subclassifications of industries engaged in manufacturing in Nebraska. 28 </seg>
