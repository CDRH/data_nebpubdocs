            <seg id="p003">SUMMARY BY LINES Cost of living was studied m 342 Nebraska farm homes. Pages 3 and 4 The average of these homes contained 2 adults and 2 children. Page 6 The average money value of the food consumed per household was approximately ?735. Page 6 Over two-thirds of the food (money value) was home-produced. This includes most of the meat, eggs, milk, butter, and vegetables, and some of the other food. Page 7 The owners, part-owners, and tenants produced about 70 per cent, and the hired men about 40 per cent of their food. Pages 7 and 8 A Nebraska farm family spends only half as much money for food as a city wage-earner's family, but consumes home-raised food enough to make the value nearly twice as great. Pages 9 and 10 About two-thirds, m money value, of the food consumed was m the form of animal products, one-fifth was groceries, and the remainder was quite evenly divided between fruit and vegetables. Pages 11-14 Every household studied reported meat consumption, which averaged 295 pounds per person per year. About five-sixths of all the meat con - sumed was produced on the home farm. Pages 12-14 The average adult consumed 57 dozen eggs a year. Page 15 Milk and cream were consumed by every household except one, to an average extent of 336 quarts per person or nearly a quart a day. Butter added 46 pounds and cheese 7.3 pounds to the diet. Pages 15-19 Flour averaged 227 pounds per person. Only about one-fifth of the householders produced any flour. Only about one-half used any whole wheat flour. Pages 19 and 20 Cereal products other than flour were purchased to the extent of 63 pounds per person, a third of which was baker's bread. Pages 20-22 Potato consumption was 431 pounds per person per year. Pages 22-24 The average quantity of fresh vegetables consumed was 166 pounds per person. Vegetables were raised m the different areas roughly m proportion to rainfall. Page 25 More than nine-tenths of all the householders used dried and canned vegetables to the extent of about 17 quarts per person. Page 25 Every household studied reported the use of fresh fruit, and practi - cally every one the use of dried and canned fruit. The two combined totaled 291 pounds per person. Pages 25-27 Only about two-fifths of the fruit was produced on the farms, and the quantity raised is apparently decreasing. Pages 27-31 Only two-thirds of the farms reported the purchase of any lard or vegetable oil and these bought only 8 pounds per person. Page 31 The sugar consumed averaged 91 pounds per person. Pages 31 and 32 Nebraska farm homes consumed over a ton and a quarter of food per person per year or about a quarter of a ton more than the average farm home and more than twice as much as the city wage-earner's home. Pages 32-34 The English farm laborer gets a little more food than the American city workeT but far less than the American farmer. Page 34 Nebraska farm homes have become less self-sufficing.

How does Nebraska tarm food consumption compare with that of other states, nations, and industries? How is Nebraska farm food con - sumption changing? A study of the kind, quantity, and cost of the food used by 342 Nebraska farm homes during the twelve months ended. May 30, 1924, undertakes to answer these questions with the aid of such data as are available from other sources. Tenure studies.— Table 1 indicates the number of homes ol each of the different tenures m each area studied for the purpose of ■ comparing owners with tenants. The field workers were asked to include about as many owners' as tenants' homes m getting data. No effort was made to get equal numbers of tenants of the different kinds, and no special point is being made of comparing share, cash, and share-cash tenants.

Meat, engs, and milk and its products are the chief items. Almost exactly two-thirds of the food consumed on the Nebraska farms studied, measured by value, was raised on the home farm, as shown in Table 4. In other states studied in 1913-14, the fraction ranged from about a third (35.5 per cent) in an area on the'.coast of west central California, to more than four-fifths (82.3 per cent) in an area in western North Carolina. It was two^hirds in the northeastern Kansas and southwestern Iowa areas studied in those years just as in Nebraska in 1924. Owners' homes consumed less food but raised about the same percentage of what they did consume as did the homes of part-owners or tenants.

            <seg id="p009">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 219 farm householders studied. In the Clay County area almost three-fourths of the food used was raised at home. One of the farm-owners from this area made the statement, "We live by a process of elimination and substitution. As far as possible, we eliminate every thing we have to buy at the store and substitute some thing we can raise at home." Owners, part-owners, and tenants raised about 70 per cent of their food as compared with only 41 per cent in the case of hired men. They raised four-fifths of their meat, all their eggs, practically all their milk, nearly nine-tenths of their butter and cheese, more than five-sixths of their potatoes and root crops, and two-thirds of their vegetables. They even furnished about an eighth of their own flour by taking wheat to mill. Probably nearly all of these Nebraska farmers raised and marketed much more than enough livestock and wheat to purchase their meat and flour. It is unfortunate that the hired man produces so little of his own food. He needs to do so even more than owners and tenants. It is very important that his employer furnish him every possible facility for keeping a garden, raising fruit, I u ' JH— — — ■ miE\ grocery &amp; BSSSSSSSSSSS PRODUCTS Ww* ; L NEB JIM [ PURCHASED J^| HOME.

He should, if possible, be kept busy the year round altho the seasonal distribution of farm labor makes this a difficult problem for the employer. If the hired man must move frequently, his opportunity to produce .his own food is greatly reduced. NEBRASKA COMPARED WITH OTHER REGIONS The average annual money value of foods used per farm household is higher in Nebraska than in the other areas sur - veyed, but the Nebraska households spent less at the stores. The home farms were made, to produce so much food for direct family use that the value of the food used seems high. Its actual cost of production was doubtless much below this. It was included in these tables at what it would have brought if sold. More than two-thirds of the food was furnished by the farms for the Nebraska homes, nearly two-thirds in Iowa and Kansas, and an average of nearly three-fifths in the four - teen non-Nebraska areas shown on the front cover page. Nebraska farm families use 60 per cent more food, meas - ured in money value, than the Omaha workmen's families surveyed by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1918 and 1919. The farmer's food costs him only about half Table 5. — Annual money value of food consumed per family Nebraska compared with other regions 1 I United States I Kansas ' Iowa j Nebraska • Items . -' . j Rural 1 | Urban* I Rural ' Rural i Rural I Urban' Families _.._ ; 12,076 46 46 324 102 Food, dollars Total -640.07 436.61 642.89 634.06 j 733 60 445 70 Purchased 266.02 427.41 224.94 209.25 j 228.04 436.16 Produced 374.05' 9.20 417.95 424.81 1 505.56 9.55 Percentage Purchased 41.fi 97.9 35.0 33.0 j 31.1 97.9 Produced ] 58.4 | 2.1 65.0 67.0 | 68.9 2.1 ■The figures for the United States, Kansas, and Iowa were computed from data Riven 4n Funk, W.

The figures in that table were secured in 1913 and 1914, .when price levels were much lower than in the year preceding Juno. 1924, which was covered by the Nebraska survey. Therefore, it was necessary to recompute them on a 1924 basis. The conversion factor used was calculated from the indices of increased cost of Uvinn from 1911 to 1925 given in the Ho. Lab. Rev. (Aug. 1925) of the Bur. Lab. Stat, U. S. Dept Lab., Table 4, p. 322.

The workman, it is true, may have a little garden plot, but this furnishes barely 2 per cent of his food and does not greatly affect his budget. All such comparisons must be made with caution because there are so many elements of incompara - bility between urban and farm families. • 100 »?00 a 300 «400 6500 »600 STOOrSO »OO »200 »300 *«0O »5OO *6OO VTO0WT50 K&amp; BOUGHT BV fARM FIG. 4.— MONEY VALUE PER HOME OF A YEAR'S FOOD About a third is bought at the store in the middle west but in some other regions still less. Some of the comparisons in Figure 4 are only moderately exact because conditions are not perfectly comparable between country and city, or between 191S and 1924. MONEY VALUE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOOD USED Nearly two-thirds of the Nebraska food value consumed was in the form of animal products, including meats, eggs, and dairy products. Groceries accounted for a fifth of the total money value and a little less than another fifth was fairly evenly divided between fruit and vegetables. These propor - tions are unusually high for animal products and low for veg - etables. Nebraska's high animal product percentage arises from the very large quantity of milk and its products used per capita rather than from any other factor. As measured in pounds, Nebraska's meat consumption is lower per capita than that of the Iowa and Kansas areas but in percentage distribution by money values about identical with them. Our dairy products consumption in the Nebraska areas studied, however, is very considerably higher, whether measured by money value, by quantity, or by percentage distribution. </seg>

Kansas and Iowa farms raised less of the food in this class than the remainder of the United States, but Nebraska had about the same average as all the other areas taken together. About three-fourths of the animal products consumed in all the areas studied thruout the United States were furnished by the farms on which they were consumed, but in each of the three middle western states, the proportion was about nine-tenths or a little more. The Kansas and Iowa areas purchased a little greater proportion of their fruits than the other areas studied in 1912-14. These other two middle west - ern states bought about two-fifths of their fruit, but in 1924 Nebraska appears to have purchased about two-thirds of its supply. This is doubtless due in part to the fact that two of Nebraska's areas are outside the better fruit-raising portion of the state. It is in part also to be explained by the fact Table 7. — Percentage of groceries, animal products, fruits, and vegetables bought. 1 Nebraska compared with other regions Items | United States Kansas | Iowa | Nebraska, Groceries- .

            <seg id="p013">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 219 that during the recent years, or even decades, fruit growing for home consumption was decreasing on the farms of a large share of the state. In percentage of vegetables furnished by the home farm, the middle west seems to be distinctly below the areas surveyed elsewhere, but Nebraska does not differ very greatly from the Kansas and Iowa areas studied. AMOUNT OF FOOD PER PERSON ANIMAL PRODUCTS Thus far we have dealt with foods in terms of percentage distribution and of dollars' worth per household. Let us now consider the amounts in terms of pounds, dozens, and quarts, as such figures are less affected by changes in the purchasing power of the dollar. Meats. — Every one of the 342 households studied re - ported meat consumption. The average amount per person was 295 pounds during the year — about six-sevenths of a pound per day. This includes all beef, pork, poultry, and lard produced on the farm and consumed in the hoiqe. It also includes all fish and fresh or cured meat purchased, but not purchased lard or lard substitutes as shown in Table 21, or any butter or other animal product reported in any of the other tables. Only 3 farms failed to report producing at least a part of the meat consumed, and about five-sixths of all meat prod - ucts consumed were produced on the home farm. Pork and poultry were especially prominent in home production, but beef was produced for home consumption on only about a third of the farms. Owners' and tenants' households did not deviate much from these averages, but in part-owners' house - holds, the consumption rose to 326 pounds per person, and hired men fell to 80 pounds, or approximately a quarter as much as in the average home studied. • The average consumption of meat and lard per capita in the United States as a whole declined from 184 pounds in 1907 almost continuously to a low point of 142 in 1917. Since that time it has risen to 181 pounds in 1924. 4 This increase has been mainly in pork consumption. Pork and beef were the principal meats used in both rural and urban homes. Fish, mutton, and miscellaneous meats were important in the homes of city wage-earners but almost entirely absent from the farm homes. Poultry supplied from a fifth to a third of the meat in the farm homes but only a twentieth in the city homes. About half the meat used in the farm homes was pork and about a fifth was beef.

            <seg id="p016">Cost of Feeding the Nebraska Family No meat was raised by the city homes but a large share of that used by the farm homes was home-raised — pork, beef, and poultry. Of the home-furnished meat used in the farm homes about three-fifths was pork, and poultry was more im - portant than beef. Beef was the most important purchased meat in both city and farm homes, pork standing second, and fish a poor third. Eggs. — Practically every home studied used eggs and practically none purchased them, in spite of the fact that the 1920 census reported 8,334 henless farms in the state — 6 7 per cent. About 57 dozen eggs per person during the year, or almost 2 eggs a day, were used with very little variation from area to area and from tenure to tenure, except that hired men stood considerably below this average. This uniformly high consumption of eggs results from their convenience and from their comparatively low farm price in this state. Funk B found egg consumption per capita greater than this in an Iowa area and greater in a Kansas area. Both areas are quite close to the Nebraska line. Farm survey work is usually done in the summer and it is possible that housewives may at .this season estimate the year's consumption higher than they would in winter when the egg supply is low and fewer are being used. Another method is now being applied to such problems which will in time give us data which will check those obtained by the methods thus far used. Between 1909 and 1919 the egg production of the United btates increased 5 per cent while the population increased 14.9 per cent. In 1919 there were less than 200 eggs per person or about 1 egg for each 2 day's rations for each of our population, exclusive of imported eggs which are often in inferior condition for food use. In 1919 Nebraska produced less than 5 per cent more eggs than in 1909 in spite of her increase of 8.7 per cent in popula - tion. Her farms supplied enough to provide an egg and a ■ quarter a day for each man, woman, and child within her borders, including those in the towns and in the cities. Only Iowa, South Dakota, and Kansas produce eggs enough to supply their populations more liberally than does Nebraska as indicated by 1919 total production. 0 Milk and its products — Milk and cream were reported as used by every household studied except one, and produced by 49 out of every 50 farms. This was substantially true of •Page 20. </seg>

Skim milk was reported by only about a sixth of the homes, buttermilk by about a quarter, and cream by more than 3 out of every 4, but whole milk was used by 9 out of every 10 homes. Cream was used on the tables of about 6 out of every 7 tenants' and part-owners, and 4 out of every 5 owners, but only 1 out of the 8 hired men. Milk, cream, and buttermilk were used to the extent of 336 quarts per person, of which 253 quarts were whole milk. The consumption varied a little among those of different tenures — more than 330 quarts per year among owners and part-owners, about ■ 332 quarts among' tenants, and less than a third of that amount among hired men. The per capita production of milk in the United States in 1919 was about 261 quarts as compared with 253 quarts in 1909. During that decade the total United States milk pror duction increased 18.6 per cent, while the population increased 14.9 per cent. In Nebraska the total population had increased 8.7 per cent but milk production has decreased 5.8 per cent and in 1919 amounted to 467 quarts per person for the total Nebraska population. This is still ample for the needs of the state and leaves a surplus of milk products for outside markets. 7 Milk production per capita varies greatly from county to county in Nebraska. Only about two-thirds of the farms of the state reported any dairy cows, January 1, 1920. Butter, cheese, and butter substitutes were consumed in the homes studied to an average extent of 54 pounds per person. Butter consumption averaged 46 pounds per person for all households with 97 per cent of all families using it; butter substitute, 1 pound with only 7 per cent of the households using it ; and cheese, 7.3 pounds with 87 per cent reporting it. Every family but one specified the use of one of these three products; 85 per cent of the households answered that they produced some of their butter at home. A few reported selling milk or cream to a dairy from which they secured butter for home use. These were tabulated as using butter supplied by the home farm. The use of butter substitutes was reported by a fifth of the homes studied about Waverly in Lancaster County, and by very few in any of the other areas. The Waverly area had a high tenancy percentage and a custom of selling whole milk. The use of cheese produced on the farm averaged 4.5 pounds while 2.8 pounds was purchased per person in the 342 homes studied. The cheese which was made for home con - 1 Population.

Home - made cottage cheese was reported by nearly two-fifths of the homes studied. Other cheese was made by only 3 Nebraska farm homes out of every 1,000 in 1919. 8 Only 43 per cent of the homes made cheese while 78 per cent purchased it. There was great variation in the consumption of these dairy products from family to family, but not from area to area or from tenure to tenure, except that hired men stood low and that butter substitute was rather more generally used by part - owners and tenants than by full owners. The butter sub - stitutes were used almost entirely in the area near Lincoln, but hardly at all in the area near Omaha, or in that in the western part of the state. Even in the area near Lincoln butter substitute was not used in very large quantities or in a very large percentage of the homes studied. Animal products per family and per person.-- In money value of animal products used per .family and per person Nebraska stands well above the other areas. even after the 1913-14 figures have been multiplied by 1.434 to reduce them to a 1924 basis for comparison with 1924 Nebraska figures. CEREAL PRODUCTS Flour and corn meal. — Every household reported the flour it used, so a very complete showing was obtained. The quantity per person averaged 227 pounds a year.

Only about one-fifth of the farms studied produced any of the flour used upon them, but those which did apparently produced about three-fourths of the amount they used. Of course all of them produced more or less wheat or corn, or both, but in most cases they did not do the grinding necessary to convert these products into flour or corn meal. Even the flour reported as supplied by the farm was rarely or never ground there, but was obtained by taking wheat from the farms to the mills and bringing it back as flour or exchanging it for flour already on hand at the mill. Only about half the households studied reported the use of any whole wheat flour. Even they used it in such small quantities as to suggest that it is more of a novelty than an established part of the diet. Corn meal and special flours. — The other flours reported were mainly corn meal, pancake, and biscuit or pastry cake flour. The use of corn meal varies greatly from area to area. It was almost negligible in the Waverly area in Lancaster County, but accounted for nearly half of the " other flour " of the area about Dix in Kimball County, and about half in the Clay and Washington County areas. Rice flour was re - ported by only one or two of the 342 households. Other cereal products purchased. — Cereal products other than flour were purchased to the extent of 63 pounds per person. Bakers' bread accounted for a third of this, but other items included are crackers, cookies, uncooked cereals, prepared breakfast foods, macaroni, spaghetti, cornstarch, tapioca, and package noodles. Owners and tenants purchased cereal products of these classes to almost exactly the same amount per person. Part - owners purchased a distinctly smaller amount and hired men a much greater amount than the owners and tenants. Bakers' bread was purchased to an average extent of 19 one-pound loaves per person, but the percentage of homes making such purchases was extremely variable from area to area. In the Kimball County area, bread was purchased only by the bachelor's home and by another from which the home - maker was absent for four months. In the Washington County area, the average of all households was 29 pounds per person, but only a third of the households purchased any. Clay County households averaged 15 pounds, with 62 per cent purchasing, and Lancaster County 29 pounds, with 86 per cent purchasing. </seg>

            <seg id="p023">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 219 Crackers and cookies were purchased by 19 out of every 20 households studied to the extent of 12 pounds per person. The great bulk of this item was made up of crackers, only a fifth of it consisting of cookies. The tenants made such purchases to a slightly greater extent than part-owners or hired men. Oatmeal or some other uncooked breakfast food was pur - chased by 9 households out of every 10 in quantities sufficient to amount to 12 pounds per person in the households which made the purchases. There appear to be no very great tenure or area peculiarities in the use of oatmeal except that share - cash and cash tenants used almost one and a half times as much as owners or hired men and that only 6 pounds per person were purchased in the Clay County area. Personal preference is probably the predominant influence in causing these differences, but they may also result in part from the varying extent to which local grocers have influenced the pur - chases. Heady-cooked breakfast foods were reported by only a slightly smaller percentage of the households and to only a slightly smaller extent per person than oatmeal and other breakfast foods which require cooking. In this case share - cash tenants stood below instead of above the average in the amount consumed per person, and hired men's households con - sumed nearly twice as much per person as did the households of other tenures. Under the head of " other cereal products " are included macaroni, spaghetti, cornstarch, tapioca, and package noodles. Practically every home reported the use of one or more of these products in quantities averaging 8.8 pounds per person per year. Cash tenants, for some reason, stood very high in quantity of each of the cereal products purchased per person. Part-owners stood low in the percentage of their number pur - chasing bread and in quantity per person in the households which purchased it. In respect to other cereal products, how - ever, part-owners' households stood at about the average for all tenures. VEGETABLES Potatoes and root crops. — The crops included with pota - toes in Table 16 are dry onions, beets, carrots, turnips, ruta - bagas, kohl rabi, and parsnips. All of these crops might be grown on practically every Nebraska farm in sufficient quan - tity to meet the needs of the family, but a considerable num - ber reported purchasing greater or less quantities.

            <seg id="p025">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 219 pound and a quarter of food a day for each person in the homes studied. In 1919 the United States raised less than 90 per cent as great an acreage of Irish potatoes as in 1909 in spite of the increase in the population to be fed. The sweet potato acre - age increased about 25 per cent in the decade, but the com - bined yield of Irish and sweet potatoes was not nearly so great in 1919 as in 1909. It amounted to about three and a half bushels for every man, woman, and child in the United States, from which must be subtracted all which decayed, were used in the manufacture of other food products, or were used for seed for the following crop. After allowing for these items, the average quantity of potatoes consumed per person in the United States was below the 7-bushel average used in the Nebraska farm homes studied. The total potato produc - tion, 1914-18, was only 4.6 bushels per capita. In 1920 there was one acre of potatoes raised in the United States for every 31 persons, but in Nebraska there was about one acre for every 15 persons, so that it was a surplus-producing state, shipping to deficit states east and south. The only states having greater potato area per person than Nebraska in 1920 were Maine, Vermont, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Idaho. Nebraska farms are thus above the average of the nation in both consumption and production of potatoes. 0 In Nebraska, practically all the potatoes reported were Irish potatoes, but small quantities of sweet potatoes were reported in the Clay County area about Fairfield.. A few sweet potatoes are raised on some Nebraska farms to give variety to the diet up to Thanksgiving time, and they can be kept longer than this by taking special care. Perhaps a more correct view of the trend of changes in per capita potato consumption in the United States can be se - cured by considering the 5-year average production. Figures based upon only one year, whether they reflect acreage or yield, are subject to wide variation in case of the potato crop. Figures for 5-year acreage averages are not available, but a comparison of the 5-year per capita production averages for 1869-1923 shows a gradual and almost continuous increase from 2.78 bushels per capita in 1869-1878 to 4.53 in 1919-23. 10 There is no way of knowing how much should be deducted from these figures because part of the crop is used for manu - facturing and for seed purposes and because decay and over - production result in much wastage in years when there is an unusually high yield.

            <seg id="p026">Cost of Feeding the Nebraska Family Every home studied used potatoes, and 90 per cent raised part or all of those used. More than 6 out of every 7 farms studied raised root crops other than potatoes for home con - sumption, but only a third purchased any. Onions and sweet potatoes together with Irish potatoes accounted for most of those purchased as indicated by Table 16. In the area about Dix in Kimball County onions were purchased from the irri - gated region farther west in that county. Fresh vegetables. — Table 17 includes all garden veg - etables except potatoes, root crops, and dried and canned vegetables. The term " greens and salads " includes not only ordinary greens of various kinds, but also lettuce, radishes, green onions, celery, cucumbers, peppers, and tomatoes. " Other vegetables " include string beans, shelled beans, corn, peas, pumpkins, egg plant, and other similar products. Rad - ishes and lettuce were most commonly reported among all tenures, with onions only a little less common. The total quantity of fresh vegetables consumed was 166 pounds per person. Owners and tenants fell a little below this, but in part-owner homes the average was 201 pounds. Practically every farm raised " greens and salads " for the home table. More than 9 out of every 10 produced their " other vegetables." It is surprising that the percentage is not still higher in this case. More than four-fifths purchased " greens and salads," doubtless largely cabbage, lettuce, and celery for use outside the gardenings season. Some truck gardening is done in the irrigated region west of the Dix area in Kimball County. Cabbage came from these truck farms to the homes about Dix. In this area the farmers who remained only during the wheat season did not raise gardens. A heavy debt contracted during recent years stimulated the others to get as much of their living as possible from their gardens, but rainfall conditions in this area are less favorable to gardening than in eastern Nebraska. Vegetables were con - sumed in the various areas roughly in proportion to the rain - fall available to raise gardens — 188 pounds per person per year in the Washington County area, 196 pounds in the Waverly area in Lancaster County, 154 pounds in the Fair - field area in Clay County, and 131 pounds in the Dix area in Kimball County. More than nine-tenths of all the households studied used dried and canned vegetables to the extent of about 17 quarts per person. Owners and tenants were practically identical on these points, with part-owners distinctly below them in percentage using, and slightly above them in number of quarts per person. Nearly 3 out of every 5 households produced at least a part of the dried and canned vegetables used, but </seg>

As great a percentage of the tenants as of the other operators produced at least part of the dried and canned vegetables they used, but a somewhat greater percentage of them made purchases. The tenants bought no greater quantities per household and produced very little less. The principal home-grown vegetables canned were corn, tomatoes, and sometimes peas and beans. Cucumbers and other garden crops were made into pickles, and cabbage into sauerkraut. Corn was the principal home-grown vegetable dried. The purchases included dried peas and beans and can - ned vegetables of various kinds. The Washington County area was higher than any other studied in percentage of farms drying and canning vegetables for home use. It was also higher than any other in quantity per person prepared in this way. The Kimball County area stood lowest in percentage of farms drying or canning veg - etables, but the Lancaster County area was lowest in the amount per person canned at home. Altho only about 55 per cent of the homes of the Kimball County area purchased dried and canned vegetables, the quantities purchased per person were greater in this area than in any other studied. FRESH FRUIT Amount used. — 'Every household studied reported the use of fresh fruit, and practically every one reported the use of dried and canned fruit. The two combined totaled 284 pounds per person or about four-fifths of a pound per day. The hired men used only about 112 pounds of fruit per person per year, or one-third of a pound per day. Among the dif - ferent areas, the amount ranged from 317 pounds in Wash - ington County to 213 pounds in the area about Dix, in Kim - ball County, where practically all the fruit must be pur - chased., Only about two-fifths of the fruit was produced on the farms whose households used it — - only 4 per cent in the Dix area. More than 90 per cent of all the fruit was secured fresh, but a large percentage was canned or dried for future use. . Insufficient fruit raised. — The orchard fruits raised on Nebraska farms are insufficient for home needs. The fruits produced within the state are mainly apples, cherries, grapes, and strawberries, but include also smaller quantities of plums, pears, peaches, and bush and cane fruits. All the orchard fruit harvested in Nebraska in 1919 did not amount to 5 pecks apiece for the rural population. If shared with the town population, it amounted to only about 3 pecks or about a tenth of a pound a day per person. If we add the strawberries, </seg>

In some parts of the state it is difficult to grow fruit, but in many counties it can be grown reasonably well, and 'in some very well. Possibly a half dozen counties in 1919 har - vested enough fruit to meet their own needs at the rate of consumption indicated by Table 19. In 1920 a third (32.6 per cent) of the Nebraska farms reported apple trees of bear - ing age, in 1923 less than a quarter (22.4 per cent). The 1920 report is that of the United States Census while the 1923 figures were tabulated from precinct assessors' reports sup - plied to the state Department of Agriculture. A comparison . of these two sets of data indicates that in all but about a half dozen of the counties fewer farms had apple trees of bearing age in 1923 than in 1920. A comparison of the 1920 and 1925 census figures tells about the same story but in terms of numbers of apple trees — not of farms having apple trees. The number of apple trees of bearing age in the state decreased from 961,313 in 1919 to 704,957 in 1924, or 26.6 per cent. In 16 counties the number was as great or greater in 1924 but they are largely western or northern counties which have never had many apple trees. Apple trees not of bearing age also show a de - cline in numbers since 1919 but it is much less marked in percentage and much less complete in covering the state. It is a decrease from 401,788 to 335,460, or 16.6 per cent, and is broken by increases in 26 counties widely scattered over the state. In 1923 almost a quarter of the owners' and part-owners' farms and a fifth of the tenants' farms had apple trees of bearing age, but the relative number and condition of the trees upon farms operated by men of various tenures is en - tirely a matter of estimate and conjecture as no figures on these points are available. A quarter of the share-cash tenants, but only a seventh of the share, and a sixth of the cash tenants, had apple trees of bearing age. In 1920 only 40 per cent of the Nebraska farms had orchard fruit trees of bearing age and only 21 per cent had trees not of bearing age coming on to replace those of bearing age as they died. There were some counties in which from 96 to 99 per cent of the farms were without any apple trees of bearing age. These were in the newer western portions of the state, but even they usually had fewer orchard fruit trees of non - 11 Agriculture. Reports for States, The Northern States.

Other fruit trees. — Peach trees show a great loss from over a million in 1900 and 1909 to about 136,000 in 1919 and 1924. In 1900 there were only 8,753 bushels of peaches picked as compared with 110,180 bushels in 1909 from prac - tically the same number of trees, while in 1919 and 1924 from about a seventh as many trees there were picked 11,461 and 2,100 bushels of peaches, respectively. Plum trees are now only about a third as numerous in Nebraska as in 1900 when there were 542,450. Production has decreased about in proportion to the loss in the number of trees. Pear trees show a continuous and rather regular but slight increase ac - companied by a great increase in production per tree, almost all since 1910. They have always been of minor importance in this state, the maximum number of trees being 67,240, reached in 1925. Cherry trees decreased in number from 607,017 in 1900 to 409,415 in 1919. Grapevines on Nebraska farms are nearly as numerous now as in 1900. They have stood not far from a million at every census except that of 1920 when there were only about half that number. Since 1920 they have increased again to about their former number. Farms raising fruits.— In 1919 strawberries were gathered on less than 3 per cent of Nebraska farms, and small fruits such as raspberries and blackberries on less than 5 per cent In 1920 only a third of the farms of the state had apple trees of bearing age and only a sixth had any not of bearing age. Only about one out of every 25 or 30 had peach trees of bearing age, and one out of every 40 had peach trees not of bearing age. More than a fifth had cherry trees of bearing age and less than half that proportion had cherry trees not of bearing age. Plums were reported on about 6 per cent of the farms and grape vines of bearing age on about 7 per cent. Decrease general. — This showing is not confined to Ne - braska. The number of apple trees of bearing age decreased 23.7 per cent, that of apple trees not of bearing age 45 per cent, in the United States between 1910 and 1920. Apple trees of bearing age decreased in number 60.6 per cent in the West North Central States of which Nebraska is one and by smaller percentages in every other geographic division except the South Atlantic, Mountain, and Pacific states. In 1920, Nebraska had only a third as many trees of bearing age as in 1910 and only about two-fifths as many apple trees not of bearing age. No Other state except Kansas and Missouri </seg>

            <seg id="p032">Cost of Feeding the Nebraska Family showed as great a percentage decrease in number of apple trees of bearing age. Increased difficulties of fruit-raising account in part at least for the decrease (1) in percentage of Nebraska farmers who raise fruit and (2) in total number of fruit trees. In - sect pests and plant diseases have increased to such an extent that satisfactory fruit can no longer be raised without spray - ing. • The earlier Nebraska apple-tree plantings were largely Ben Davis. Since the Illinois blister canker, against which there is no remedy, has become serious in Nebraska, it has done especial damage to this variety. In view of this showing it is apparent that the average Nebraska farmer (1) gets along with very little fruit, (2) plants fewer fruit, trees and less small fruit, or (3) special - izes on other farm products to such an extent that he can afford to buy fruit. FATS, SWEETS, AND DRINKS Table 20 includes all the sugar, syrup, tea, coffee, and cocoa used, and all the honey, lard, and table oils purchased. Home-produced lard is included with pork in Table 8 but was not separately reported by the homemakers who gave the information. At least a third of the farms must have pro - duced all the lard they used as only two-thirds reported the purchase of any lard they used or table oil such as salad dressing, peanut butter, and lard substitutes. These pur - chased only 6.6 pounds of lard and table oil per individual during the year, so they must have produced a very large share of the lard used. The sugar used averaged 91 pounds per person per year, or a quarter of a pound a day. Part-owners and hired men used a little more and owners a little less. The amount used in different areas ranged from 83 pounds per person per year in Clay County to 107 in Lancaster County. The Lancaster County homes, however, were quite low in quantities of honey and syrup used. The purchase of sugar might perhaps be considerably de - creased in Nebraska homes if more bees were kept. In most parts of the state there is a profusion of plants from which honey might be made. In 1920, however, only about 7. per cent of Nebraska farms kept any honey bees. If the 573,453 pounds of honey produced on these farms in 1919 were evenly distributed it would give only about half a pound to each man, woman, and child in Nebraska, or two-thirds of a pound for each inhabitant of rural territory." 11 Population.

            <seg id="p033">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 219 The number of stands of bees in Nebraska has decreased from 52,143 hives, producing 866,200 pounds of honey in 1899, to 45,626 hives, producing 527,868 pounds in 1910, and to 40,971 hives, producing 199,563 pounds in 1919. In 1900, 10 per cent of Nebraska farms reported the keeping of bees, as compared with 12.4 per cent in the entire United States. In Nebraska owners ranked highest in this respect in 1920 with 14.3 per cent keeping bees, while managers with 5.8 and tenants with 6.3 per cent keeping bees stood lowest. In 1920 only about 7 per cent of all farms kept any honey bees. Figures for separate tenures are not available except for 1899. 13 It is probably better not to have bees kept on every farm because of the special knowledge required and the danger of the spread of bee diseases. The man who becomes something of a specialist in this line can supply his neighbors with honey if they are willing to pay a price which will justify him in buying the supplies and taking the time from crop work to care for from 15 to 40 swarms of bees. There were no very great variations from area to area or tenure to tenure in consumption of fats, sweets, and drinks except that the hired men purchased a little over 4 times as many pounds of fat per person as any other tenure. Doubt - less this is in part because of their lower butter consumption per person and in part because they were not so well situated to supply themselves by raising and butchering hogs. DISTRIBUTION BY WEIGHT OF FOOD USED Pounds per person, in country and city. — Table 21 indi - cates that the Nebraska farm homes studied consumed more than a ton and a quarter of food a year per capita (adult equivalent) . The Iowa and Kansas farm figures stand at a little less than a ton and one-fifth or slightly below that of Nebraska, but the figure for all United States rural areas is only about a ton. The city working man's family consumes less than half as many pounds of food per year but a number of things must be remembered in making this comparison. (1) The farmer has readily at hand great quantities of bulky food for which he makes no conscious financial outlay. (2) The farm figures include families of all degrees of purchasing power to be found in the country, whereas the city figures are based entirely upon wage-earners' budgets.

(4) Greater economy in cooking and in use of scraps is stimulated in the city home which has no pigs and chickens to utilize the waste. The various kinds of food were con - sumed in about the same proportion in city and country ex - cept that milk and meat constituted higher percentages of the total in the country than in the city, while flour and cereals constituted higher percentages in the city. In comparing the Nebraska percentages in this table with those in Table 3, which gives the distribution of the same food by money value instead of by weight, we note certain marked differences due to relative differences in price of the various articles. Meat forms an eighth of the farmer's diet by weight, but because of its high value per pound it represents a quarter of the money value of his food. Milk and its products, being cheap and available, supply three-tenths of his food by weight and only one-tenth by money value. Even more startling is the difference when we come to potatoes, the cheapest food which he consumes in bulk. These furnish nearly a fifth of his diet by weight and require only a thirtieth of his outlay. The English hired man's household consumes about one and one-eighth times as much food per person as that of the American urban worker, but only about two-thirds as much as that of the Nebraska farm hired man if the 8 families included in this survey are typical. Hired men were, in 1902, about three-fifths of those gainfully employed in English agri - culture. Their diet has less variety than that of any Ameri - can class shown in this table. More than two-fifths of it consists of bread and flour, while a quarter is potatoes. Hired men of the two nationalities ate about the same amount of meat but the Nebraskan added 63 pounds of eggs. His Eng - lish cousin consumed practically no eggs and only about a third as much of milk and of fruit and vegetables other than potatoes. The English figures for fruit and vegetables are available in the report quoted only as a total of the two items and not for fruit and vegetables separately. Home produced food. — Nearly three-fourths, by weight, of the food consumed in the homes studied was raised on the home farm, as compared with about four-fifths in the United States as a whole in 1913-1914. This Nebraska percentage is about midway between the Iowa and Kansas percentages shown on the table.

On most of these points the Nebraska figures do not differ very radically from those of the country localities with which they are compared. In interpreting the difference it must be remembered that (1) some local variation. is always to be expected, (2) there are some differences m judgment used by field workers, and (3) some changes m food habits between 1913 and 1924 might tend to change these percentages somewhat. SUMMARY The value of food consumed was about $735 per familv gl* year In * e " 342 Nebraska farm homes studied. Of this $230 or nearly a third was actually spent at the stores or elsewhere, but the remaining $505 — 68.9 per cent — is the value imputed to food raised on the farm on which it was consumed. From pioneer days until now we have shifted from the self-sufficing economy, under which each farm largely met its own needs, to the commercial economy, under which it produces one or a few things for sale and buys much « • i* us , es&lt; Nebrask a farm households are still self - sufficing to a large extent as. far as food is concerned, altho in many other matters they are almost entirely upon the basis of the commercial economy. ..

It is probable that the most of the farms which re - ported the purchase of meat sold cattle, hogs, or poultry enough to produce many times as much as was purchased. Vegetables were generally neither bought nor sold on the eastern Nebraska farms studied but produced upon a self - sufficing basis. In the drier western Nebraska area studied, the gardens were insufficient for home needs. They were sup - plemented by purchase of vegetables from irrigated regions within about 30 miles. Cereal products were generally pur - chased even on grain farms because of the manufacturing processes involved. The flour and cornmeal situation re - sembles that of meat, but presents somewhat greater diffi - culties to those who desire a self-sufficing economy. The home curing of meat is much more general and much more readily done by most people than the home grinding of cornmeal and flour. Nebraska farm fruit and vegetable consumption is largely on a commercial basis. Advantages could be secured in economy and freshness if home-grown fruits and vegetables entered more largely into the diet instead of purchased sup - plies. As pests have increased, home fruit growing has in - creasingly required spraying and other economical and easily mastered practices. In some ways, actual farm practice is still moving in the direction of the commercial economy. 15M) </seg>
