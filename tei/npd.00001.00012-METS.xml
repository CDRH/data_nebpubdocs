Jjcmdi and Bv&amp;dmgtfor the. State 

of Nebraska 

In submitting to you this, the first biennial report of the Su 
perintendent of the State Reform School for juvenile offender 
at Kearney, Buffalo Co., Neb., you will please pardon me for sa\ 
ing in advance that it may not be as full and complete in all i 
details, as might be desired, and the only excuse I have to offe 
for omissions, that in your judgment, may occur, is, as you ar 
well aware, that this is my first report, and it devolving on me t 
organize this Institution, many things may have been done in 

Institution, many things may have been done in a 

manner not guided by precedent in older institutions in other 
States, still, we have acted in all things in that way that seemed 
to us best calculated to do the greatest amount of good to those 
committed to our care, and at the same time carefully protect the 
property of the State placed in our etutbdy, and economically use 
so much of the fund appropriated for the running expenses of 
the Institution lor the year- L881— 2, M in our best judgment 
seemed necessary. 

Upon taking charge of the Institution I found it without kitchen, 
barn or other outbuilding, or furniture of anv kind. The tir-f 

labor performed by me as Superintendent, was in the erection of 
kitchen, barn, and vault, (water closet;, the cleauing of school 
building, &amp;c, purchasing of furniture, team, harness and wagon, 
farming utensils, placing the furniture in the house, and general 
preparation for "keeping house," which laborious duty was finished 
to such a degree as to be ready to admit inmates in July, 
1881.

REPORT OF TIIK 

Pt'RPOSE OF THE SCHOOL. 

I he Bchool has thus far been conducted upon the principle that 
boys and girls committed to our eare, though generally ignoof 
the most common branches usually taught in the district 
K)ls of the State and strangers to good home discipline, shall 
o trained in all things, so far as our limited means will admit, 
go to constitute the elements necessary to make a good man 
•oman in society, that when discharged from the school, the 
of having been an " inmate of the Reform School " instead 
eing in any way a disgrace, will be an honor to them, recogd 
as such, by those with whom they come in contact in after 

METHODS OF TRAINING. 

Upon first entering this school as an inmate, each boy or girl 
is informed of the duties that will devolve upon him or her and 
of the course of conduct necessary to be pursued on their part, of 
the acts to be done and those to be avoided. They are required 
iirst and above all things to observe that course of moral conduct 
essential to the well being of good society, to be studious and 
polite, truthful and honorable, industrious and economical. They 
are required to attend school at least four hours every day, Saturday 
Mid Sundav ixcepted, and upon Sunday each one is required 
to be present at Divine service and Sabbath-school, singing, &amp;c, 
ae usually conducted in the Sabbath-schools of the country. Our 
school work ie the same as the district schools of the State. 
Having no shops, material or tools, with which to conduct any, 
and no facilities for instruction in aay trade, nothingof the kind has 
as yet been attempted further than to teach the boys agriculture, 
gardening and the general method of conducting a farm, which 
we are irlad to be able to show, has not been without good results, 

resu 

tto the inmates and the Reform School. The girls are taught 
same l&gt;r.. hool as the boys and in addition good

FARM WORK. 

In the year 1881, nothing of value was raised on the farm, for 

two reasons: 1st, the ground was in no condition to raise a cro^ 

2d, it was too late when we came here to plant or sow to any 

advantage, and nothing save a tew tons of millet which is now 

on hand, was raised. This vear (1882) however, our farm hai 

been a source of some little profit to the table as well as to tho 

farm expense. We raised twelve acres of rye that yielded one 

hundred and thirty-four bushels, fourteen acres of oats that 

yielded four hundred and thirteen bushels. We had ton: 
acres of corn that we have fed to the hogs as they needed it, and 

acr&lt; 

an only estimate its yield. The remainder of the 

ground was planted to potatoes and vegetables, of which we haw 

in the pit over three hundred bushels of potatoes, four to: 

beets, three tons of carrots, six hundred head of cabbage, together 

with a quantity of dried and pickled sweet corn, which you wi 

in 

find reported in the statement attached 

On the 11th day (if August, 1881, as shown by financial stau

I had as well state here as at any other part of my report, that 

during the past season, we have put under the plow in addition 

to what was broken when we first came here, fifty-two acres of 

prairie, which, together with the ground formerly broken, baa 

all been fall plowed, including the corn ground. We have

THE 

yearling forest trees, seventy-two per cent, of which have grown 
v and are now alive. We also planted one hundred and 
thirty-eight fruit trees of the most hardy varieties, ninety per 
of which have grown finely and are now living; also three 
hundred and thirty-six grape vines, gooseberries and blackberries, 
all of which have grown and done as well so far as my experience of 
sixteen years in tree culture in Nebraska has shown them to do in 
any other part of the State. I will say in this connection that there 
:ire many improvements sadly needed. First of all, a new building 
with a much greater capacity than the present one. The capacity 
of this Imilding was not intended to exceed thirty inmates. We 
now have thirty-seven, and have had forty-three, as you will see 

l&gt;v reference to the tables showing the commitments of inmat 

Efe also need shops, tools, &amp;c, not that all boys ought to learn 
ide. by any means, but that such as have mechanical genius, 
be encouraged in that direction and make useful citizens to 
Slate, as well as to earn their education and support in this 
itution. 

In my judgment there ought to be a sufficient appropriation 
for fencing to give us a good pasture, as we have plenty of good 
grazing land not suited to agriculture, to sustain such a number 
of cattle (cows) as will be a source of great profit to the large 
tftmilv that must soon be domiciled here; also to give us at least 
three additional farm teams so that we may be enabled to cultitwo 
hundred acres of land, and with seasons as favorable as 
those of 1881-2, would enable us to very materially lessen the 

Ken of the Institution upon the State, and in the near futu 
e the "Nebraska Reform School" almost self-sustaining. 

The results of our labors since the opening of the School have 
on the whole been very gratifying indeed. The inmates as a 
rule are contented and as happy as could be expected under the 
eircvDMtanees. With perhaps one or two exceptions they are 
naturally as well qualified to be intelligent men and women as 
generality r &gt;t boya and L r irls in ;mv school in the State. The </seg>

genera] health of the family has been good ; there has, of course, 
been some sickness, but no more than usual among the MUM 
number in communities at large, and I am happy to be able to 
¦ay in no case fatal. It has been my custom to attend all cases 
of sickness myself, without extra cost to the State, and would 
prefer to do 6O. A sufficient appropriation for drugs and medieinet, 
etc., ought to be made. One hundred dollars per year will 
be all that will be needed, unless we should be attacked by a 

I desire to call the attention of the Board to the fact that tor 
the years 1881 and 1882 no appropriation was made for cloti 
boots and shoes, hats or caps, nor for material for the same, and 

consequently all material for clothing, as well as for bedding for 
all inmates, has necessarily been taken from the living expeaM 
account, thus very materially increasing what may appear to be 
the cost per capita per week of the running expense of the School, 
hence the item in my estimate for the years 1883 and 1884 of 
11,200 per year for said material.

CONCLUSION 

I desire to return our thanks to the friends who have to earn-rained 
us in our efforts to benefit the unfortunate.children 
placed in our care, and especially would we remember the 
State Board of Public Lands and Buildings, who have ever been

iesire that the State Reform School shoulu be a complete 
success. And to the many friends of the reform work throughout 
the State we desire to return our sincere thanks for many 
kind words and good wishes. And in conclusion I desire most 
earnestly to thank those who have rendered me such valuable 
assistance in all my efforts in behalf of the School. To the ft! atrou.

faithful manner in which they have discharged their respective 
duties. May we be permitted to express the hope that in all 
things we may be guided by "unerring wisdom from On High, " 
to the end that the choicest blessings from an ever kind Providence 
may attend us in our efforts to assist the unfortunate in 
becoming useful men and women in society, and in being prepared 
to be numbered with the "just made perfect," in a world 
that never ends.
