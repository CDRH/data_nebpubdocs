FOREWORD. 

It is customary to introduce every report, annual or biennial, 
with general statements of the marvelous progress during the 
term in matters to which the report pertains; but upon delving 
into the reports of the state superintendents of public instruction 
in Nebraska one is confronted with the fact that it is wonderfully 
true that in matters educational our attention and 
interest and efforts at improvement run largely in cycles. 
Nor is this strange when we remember that school work in 
Nebraska, and in many other states, particularly the newer oues, 
requires unremitting effort in upbuilding against an incessant 
tearing down process. Consider for a moment, if you please, 
a profession or a trade that requires regular, systematic and 
careful training for its work ; then imagine the employment of 
8.000 persons in that trade or profession, three-fourths of whom 
are without any special training for it; then imagine the dismissal 
of one-fourth of the total number at the close of each 
vear's work, aud the shifting about of two-thirds of the others 
from one place to another, having different conditions, new 
environment and a new set of people to become acquainted with 
in order to do the best work : then you can begin to realize the 
public school situation in Nebraska, and to understand why the 
great and strenuous efforts of the best educators of the state are 
to a degree futile. The work must be done over and over and 
over again. Moreover, there is no great centralized power. 
Outside the large cities, the school officers outnumber the 
teachers five to two. The 7,000 schools of Nebraska are managed 
and controlled by 22,000 school district officers, and from 
6,000 to 7,000 of the°e each year are new in office and strange 
to the duties required. Each year the district board may upset 
the work of the board*of the previous year, change the 
course of study and the rules and regulations and the teacher 
also, who in three times in four is new to the position, and 
the teacher may adopt entirely new methods, request new 
books, and "set back" the pupils in their books and progress

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

several months. There is a vast .amount of divided responsibility, 
and too much opportunity to shift it. 

A year ago was requested to deliver an address on "Nebraska's 
Position as an Educational State Ten Years Ago, Now, 
and Ten Years Hence." The preparation for that address 
necessitated my delving into the Report for the Bienniucn ending 
November 80, 1890, to compare it with the Report for the 
Biennium ending November 30, 1900, and in that report of 1890 
I found reference to many of the problems that still vex us. 
My worthy predecessor, Hon. Geo. B. Lane, then closing a 
successful four years' administration of the office, was much 
worried in his attempts to collect and compile and promulgate 
school statistics, and suggests in his report that all institutions 
of learning be required by law to report annually to the superintendent 
of public instruction in such form as he shall direct. 
He did succeed in getting complete reports from the county 
superintendents, owing to the necessity of their making the 
same to entitle their counties to share in the apportionment of 
state school moneys, but a comparatively small number — a 
minority of the graded schools of the state — made report to 
the state superintendent in 1890. 

Mr. Lane also suggests that the law be changed so as to require 
three months' school in districts with less than twentyfive 
pupils instead of thirty-five, as it still reads. He also calls 
attention to the permanent school fund in the following 
manner : 

' 'The amount of cash on hand producing no income is 522,-354.86. 
This amount is rapidly increasing and provisions 
should at once be made for its investment that the interest 
derived from it may be added to our temporary fund and pass 
directly to the schools. Nothing less than a change in the 
constitution of the state will permit its investment, as the 
securities of the investment of this fund are limited by the 
constitution to United States, state, and county bonds. These 
securities are no longer available. The report of the school 
district bonded indebtedness in this state, as given in another 
place in this report, shows that $2,233,210.53 bonds are now 
outstanding, mostly bearing seven per cent interest, and held 
by eastern capitalists. No better securities can be found in 
this state than registered school district bonds. Would it not </seg>

be a part of the duty of the state to the school districts to invest 
its permanent school funds in these district bonds? The 

interest paid by these districts would be returned by way of 

apportionment to the school districts, to the great good of the 

schools and at no loss to the state. ' ' 

This is from the report of 1890. Many have undoubtedly 

heard the same comment in every biennial campaign from that 

time until the present. In order that we may know a little 

more regarding the differences in conditions between 1890 and 
1900, and the growth or changes during that decade, I here- 

with submit a few statistics.

This report for 1890 suggests a four years' high school 

English course of study, including with studies now commonly 

taught the following : one half year each in Political Science, 

English History. Astronomy, Geology, Zoology and Trigo- 

nometry. Conferences were at that time held between the 

University authorities and the State Association of Superin- 

tendents and Principals, and courses were adopted which were 

recommended for use in all the high schools of the state. A 

Course of Study for Common Schools was also prepared, pub- 

lished, and submitted to district school boards for adoption. 

The course was based largely upon that of Wisconsin. The same 

report contained a strong plea for the township system of 

school government, presenting many of the same arguments 

in favor of a township district that are now presented in favor 

of the consolidation of country school districts and the public </seg>

transportation of pupils. Two pages of the report are devoted 
to Arbor Day. The State Teachers' Reading Circle occupies 
a single page, and the course of study for that year included 
Compayre's Lectures on Teaching, Welch's How to Organize, 
Classify and Teach a Country School, and Selections from 
Hawthorne and His Friends. Very many pages of the report 
are filled with examination questions. 

In 1890 the subjects of manual training, domestic science, 
and the kindergarten were being discussed in Nebraska, but 
little progress has been made during the past decade in any 
of these outside the large cities. In university extension, however, 
spreading out and reaching down into the high schools 
of the state, developing and building up these high •school 
Curses, much, in some cases perhaps too much, has been acmplished. 
During the past decade the University of Nebraska 
has cut off its preparatory school of two years. During 
the same time hundreds of high schools all over the state have 
builded on one or two years more than they should, or so it 
appears to one who takes into consideration the relative 
value of the three departments — primary, grammar and high 
school, — and with no other excuse than that of keeping the 
boys and girls, a few of them, at home a year or two longer. 

Although it is true that many of the same problems were 
discussed in associations of Nebraska teachers ten years ago 
that are now agitating us, yet there was this difference: at that 
time these'discussions took place in associations of teachers 
alone, whereas today the problems are being discussed in 
patrons' meetings, in school board gatherings, and in the public 
press. The people of the state of Nebraska know much 
more about their public school system today than they did ten 
years ago, and yet I do not think they know as much about it 
as they should. I believe in publicity in all matters relating 
to the general welfare of the schools. I believe in an intimate 
acquaintance of school patrons and their schoolrooms, but I 
hope that all such investigations will be done fairly and honestly, 
and that those who make them will always hold the good 
of the school in the foreground. 

in 1910 

I prophesy that in 1910 city superintendents and principals 
will be required by law to make as complete reports and to </seg>

            <seg id="p026">

furnish statistics of school attendance as county superintendents 
now are ; that their work will be done more systematically. 
There will, let us hope, be a revision of the method of assessment 
and levying of taxes before that time ; a consequent 
reduction of the maximum tax levy, a slight increase in the 
receipts for all school purposes, a very slight increase in the 
expenditures, but that waste through lack of organization and 
system will be largely reduced. Let us hope that the number 
of men teachers employed, which decreased nearly thirty per 
cent during the past decade, will increase. The number of 
women teachers decreased only about four per cent during the 
same time. In this connection permit me to call your attention 
to the fact that the average monthly wages of men during the 
decade increased $3.26, while that of the women decreased 
$1.02. In both there should and must be a material increase 
if we wish to keep in the profession the better qualified persons. 
In 1910 the enrollment will be a larger per cent of the 
school census than in 1900, but what is of vastly more importance, 
the average daily attendance will be a much greater per 
cent of the enrollment and of the school census than in 1900. 
The number of sod and log school buildings in the state will 
rapidly decrease, the number of frame school buildings will 
slightly decrease, while the number of brick buildings will 
increase. During the next ten years there will be a decrease 
in the total number of school buildings in the state of Nebraska 
through the consolidation of rural school districts. There will 
be a material increase in the length of the term in many school 
districts of the state ; and let us hope that in 1910 our county 
superintendents will average at least $1000 a year each. Our 
State Teachers' Association, our great University, and our 
State Normal School will increase their enrollment and usefulness 
'materially. There will then be three State Normal 
schools. In 1910 in many of the rural portions of the state the 
farmers' children will have the same advantages of education 
in a well arranged, well organized, well graded school, 
that the village and city pupils now enjoy. Instead of attempting 
to let down our hooks and nets and tackles and lines from 
the University above, in 1910 we will build from the kindergarten 
up, carrying the better features of the kindergarten 
through the primary grades, correlating with them manual </seg>

training and domestic science and elementary agriculture in the 
grammar grades, and preparing our pupils better for practical 
life by giving more attention to the scientific side and less to the 
classical side than we did in 1890, or than we do now. In 1910 
we will distinguish between one-, two-, three-, and four-year 
high schools, their diplomas or certificates and their graduates, 
as we now distinguish between University graduates and those 
who complete only the Junior year, or the Sophomore year, 
or only the Freshman year ; or as we distinguish between those 
who complete the eighth, seventh, sixth and fifth grades 
respectively in the Grammar department. A high school graduate 
then will be one who has completed the three-thirds of our 
public school system, including the high school department of 
four years. In 1910 the high schools of the state will be as 
free to the children of the farmer and the stock raiser as they 
are now to the children of the merchant, the banker and the 
professional man. In 1910 the public will demand that those 
who train and direct and assist in developing their children's 
minds and morals and habits and manners have the same 
thorough training "for their work as those who look after 
their children's bodies in times of ill-health. The teacher will 
then be a professional man or woman. In 1910 we will have 
a law fixing the dimensions and other requirements of school 
rooms and school buildings, as well as the size and character 
of school grounds. School rooms will then be arranged with 
reference to proper seating, heating, lighting and ventilating, 
and with a greater regard for the comfort and convenience of 
school children. Every school room will then be provided 
with maps, a globe, a dictionary, and a library. Our teaching 
body will then be the same earnest, progressive, hard-working 
people they now are, even though a large per cent of its membership 
will be changed three times during the decade, but 
the third group will be better prepared in advance for its great 
work than the first group. No one, working alone, can do 
an appreciable amount toward effecting these improvements, 
but all of us, patrons, teachers, principals and superintendents, 
working together, may accomplish much for the schools and 
school children of Nebraska. 


OBSTACLES TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS. 

I desire to present here for consideration topics that I hear 
mentioned as I go out among the people of this state ; out into 
the cities and villages and rural communities of the commonwealth. </seg>

            <seg id="p028">
Once upon a time a farmer was impressed with the argument 
that only by averaging might the best results be accomplished. 
He had heard that one extreme in either direction was very 
generally condemned, and he was told that for the best results, 
practical and progressive, the two extremes must be used, 
thereby securing a fair average. With that idea fully impressed 
upon his mind, he hitched to his plow, side by side, an ox 
from New England and a finely bred, high-stepping, 2:10 trotting 
horse from Kentucky. 

The great heterogeneous mass of the people is thus driving the 
public schools. Is it any wonder that our "Gee, Whoa, Haw, 
Git-ap" is no more effective, or that our furrows are none the 
less crooked? Our ox takes the furrow, and keeps it, in the 
rut, while our trotting horse prances about, making but little 
impression en the unbroken sod. Sometimes we find the combination 
illustrated in the contrast between the rural schools 
that have remained unchanged through three generations, and 
the finely supervised or over-trained city school systems; 
sometimes we find the two existing in the same place under 
different administrations, — at one time traveling the hard, 
stony, well-worn and well-known path of the past, and at 
another endeavoring to make new paths and new byways on 
the virgin sod, on unbroken prairie ; seeking out untried and 
untrod paths and — pastures. 

Some demand of us that we dispense with the services of our 
high-stepping, over-strung trotting horses, and return to the 
yoke, — of oxen, of course. They charge that we teaeh less 
thoroughly than formerly, that we attempt too many subjects 
and give but a smattering of each. We may seem to be tending 
somewhat in that direction, but we are driven to it. The pres-

ure is from without, — not from within the schools. The 
medical men demand that a regular system of physical trainng 
be used ; the G. A. R. want military science and drill ; the 
lergymen insist that morality be inculcated by line and preept; 
the W. C. T. U. has succeeded in introducing formal 
teaching of the effects of alcohol, tobacco, narcotics and stimuants; 
the women's clubs beg for domestic science, the sewing 
guilds for needle work, the trades for manual training, the 
usiness world for stenography and typewriting, the editors 
or current events, the artists for picture study, the musical 
world for music, and the farmer for the elements of agriculture. 

One of the gravest problems presented to our rural school 
teachers and their county superintendents is the desire of many 
school boards and patrons to introduce intu the rural schools 
high school subjects. School people generally understand that 
these subjects cannot be taught there without great detriment 
to the work and instruction of the little folks. I have found 
many rural districts where it is demaiuled of the teachers that 
they instruct classes in algebra, civics and physical geography, 
in addition to thirty or more classes in reading, arithmetic, 
spelling, geography, grammar, physiology, etc. 

kThe demands of our modern civilization are great. Two or 
ree generations ago it was not necessary for the youth to 
udy the sciences — there was but little known of them to study. 

Today the well educated youth must be familiar with modern 
machinery, with common business practice, with affairs of 
state, and the latest scientific discoveries. With the telegraph 
and cable connecting all the cities of the world, with the telephone 
soon to connect all its farmhouses, with steam-ships and 
steam cars and electric cars connecting all its cities, great and 
small, with million-dollar bridges spanning all its great rivers, 
and with its vast commercial enterprises, there is no end or 
limit to the practical knowledge that may be gathered. 

There is poor and indifferent work as well as excellent work 
done in the schoolrooms of Nebraska, and this is true in every 
state in the Union, in every country of the world, and it always 
has been true. There is always good, bad and indifferent work 
in every other walk and avocation of life, in every other profession 
and every trade, and with less excuse for such a condition; 
for in the other professions and in most of the trades </seg>

            <seg id="p032">

there is more regular, systematic and careful training for the 
work than we find for our important work of training the 
youth of the land. And low salaries accompany unskilled labor. 

In the 8,500 schoolrooms in Nebraska this year, and every 
year, we find nearly 2, 500 teachers who have had no experience 
whatever, and not one-fifth of the number have had any special 
training for the work. Obstacles' Nebraska employs 
annually over 9,000 teachers, in less than 8,500 school rooms. 
Many teach only three months ' They meet with obstacles. 
And so do the pupils: — obstacles to progress' Our 9,000 
teachers include less than 2,000 male teachers, whereas twelve 
years ago the state employed 2,800 male teachers. A majority 
of our female teachers are under age (twenty-one years). The 
average school year in the state is six and three-fourth months, 
and the average salary is forty dollars a month, something like 
$270.00 a year. This includes superintendents and principals 
who receive from $500 to $3,600 a year. There are scores of 
principals in the state receiving $585, $630, or $675 a year, less 
than the labor of many unskilled workmen. The average life 
of a school teacher in Nebraska, as a teacher, is less than four 
years. Yes, we have our obstacles. And yet we can boast of 
our very low percentage of illiteracy in Nebraska. 

Some of the obstacles in the way of educational progress 
have been placed there by school people, some by the public 
generally, and still others through co-operation. I desire to 
enumerate a few. 

Within educational ranks we have established and permit to 
exist the following obstacles to educational progress : 

Black of unification in our educational forces. This inbs 
a lack of harmony between universities, colleges, normal 
ols, business colleges, etc. 

A low professional interest among teachers. To increase 

the interest we must improve the teacher, and the public 

should demand a higher standard of requirements. 

Too many preparatory schools for higher schools, at least in 
comparison with the number of preparatory schools for happy, 

useful lives. Perhaps the number of the latter can be in- 

creased without decreasing the former. 

The attempt to create or manufacture instead of train and 

develop; to turn out money-making machines instead of well- </seg>

31 

developed manly and womanly characters. In this connection 
also we may include the scattering fire caused by too many 
aims. 

Too many persons in the work who are without educational 
opinions, and too many others in the work who are educationally 
opinionated. 

Too much emphasis placed on forms and methods. 

Mixture of standards and transition of ideals — the yawning 
Scylla and Charybdis of the pedagogue — generating much 
pressure and nervous strain. This strain is so tense that the 
tendency is that the teacher loses the best of himself, his 
poise, his courage, and his full joy of life. To hide his loss, 
he becomes a recluse, which militates decidedly against a unified 
ideal among teachers. This is in itself an impediment 
to progress. If, however humbly and truly, the teachers are 
the servants of the public, they must at length become a sort 
of composite Moses, to lead the public out of the educational 
wilderness into that glad Canaan which awaits. 

The general public has kindly assisted in rolling in the following 
obstacles and hedging them 'round about our public 
school system : 

Misunderstanding the nature of education, the purpose of 
education, and the results that should be expected : establishing 
false and pernicious ideals. 

There is a widely different point of view between the public 
and the teaching world. Neither the general nor the teaching 
public, as a whole, has a clear idea of what it wants or what 
should be expected. A clearer comprehension of what education 
is or should be must precede any marked advancement in 
securing the same. There are too many aims in education on 
either side, and fusion here has simply aided and emphasized 
confusion 

The lack of unselfish feeling, partnership and co-operation 
between parents and teachers is a great obstacle to educational 
progress, which in this case had better be expressed as the 
child's progress and wellbeing. With this should be included 
the oft recurring conflict between parental and state authority 
as to what a child's minimum education should be, what he 
must study, and the governmental or disciplinary authority, 
relatively, of parent and teacher. 

* </seg>

            <seg id="p034">
32 



Another obstacle is the neglect of a physical education that 
would develop bodily conditions able to support a vigorous 
mentality. 

Over-crowded courses of study, with scattering fire instead 
of concentration aud consolidation, prevent substantial progress. 


Last, but not by any means least, among the obstacles to 
educational progress, for which we are all responsible whether 
within or without the ranks of the teaching profession, is the 
unprofessional standing of teachers and their low salaries. 
I feel that the one who accepts a low salary — an amount far 
below what his services are really worth — is equally guilty for 
evil results with the one who offers the same. 

Now I am going to make a series of bald, perhaps gray, 
statements of obstacles to educational progress, the removal 
of which is chiefly in the hands of the public. They must be 
asked to remove them. Many of them are beyond a school 
superintendent's power and jurisdiction. 

Decentralization: — Outside the great cities, the school 
officers outnumber the teachers five to two. The 7,000 schools 
of Nebraska are managed and controlled by 22,000 school district 
officers. This is lack of concentration with a vengeance. 
There is too much divided responsibility. The superintendents 
are willing to assume more. There are too many small schools 
and smaller classes. 

Irregular attendance is a great obstacle. 

In many parts of the country there is a lack of sufficient 
funds to properly conduct the schools. Some states place a 
limit on the legal amount of school taxation and bonded indebtedness 
of school districts, and upon nothing else; probably 
upon the theory that the people in their great interest in the 
welfare of their children may expend too much upon their education 
and general welfare, while there is no fear whatever that 
too large an amount will be expended upon the care of the 
streets and the improvement of roads, a sufficient amount of 
drinking water and plenty of "gas." We ask fora higher 
appreciation by the public of the importance of school work, 
and a willingness to contribute more freely to the support of 
the legitimate work of the public schools. </seg>

OBSTACLES TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS. 

The public demand specialization before fundamentals are 
mastered. They demand the teaching of too many subjects. 

The demand for one specialty is made by one profession, for 
another subject by another profession or trade, and so on, and 
the public does not realize the sum total of a school teacher's 
unhappiness in this respect. One of these demands is for 
short, abbreviated, hotbed business courses, and too many 
high schools are offering a course that gives little or no training, 
and affords in six months' time no more information than 
a young man might acquire in a bank or lumber yard in two 
weeks. 

There is too strong a demand from without to get the children 
through school in too brief a time; too much commercialism 
; too much love of the almighty dollar. A popular notion 
prevails that an education is an extraneous equipment which 
may be bartered for a livelihood. 

The present social conditions and the demand for society or 
social life for mere school children interferes greatly with 
solid, substantial, progressive school work. 

One of the greatest obstacles to educational progress is the 
gieat lack of professionally trained teachers, and the lack of 
facilities for training them. 

There is a lack of strong men and able women in the ranks, 
caused by lack of appreciation, of adequate pay, of stable conditions. 
There must be better pay, and a surer, longer tenure 
of office to draw and retain men especially of ability and 
character. " 


The powers that be must cease to foist upon the schools 
their dependent and unqualified relatives. The great mass of 
the people, the great middle class, the practical, progressive 
people with a good, common school education and commonsense 
ideas and ideals, must awake to the real needs^of the 
schools and show less apathy to school work. 

I believe that the addition of school gardens, gymnasiums, and 
manual training and domestic science schools would remove 
many obstacles to educational progress. 

My own experience emphasizes the lack of efficient supervision 
for rural schools, a cure for which would be the centralization 
and consolidation under township organization. A county </seg>

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES 

Section 4 of Subdivision VIII of the School Laws of Nebraska, 
Chapter 79 of the Compiled Statutes) says: "He (the 
superintendent of public instruction) shall decide disputed 
points in school law, and all such decisions shall be held to 
have the force of law till reversed by the courts." Section 5 
of the same subdivision requires the state superintendent to 
prescribe forms for making all reports and regulations for all 
proceedings under the general school laws of the state. 

I have endeavored to visit everv part of the state in person, 
and during the biennium have visited nearly all the counties 
at their county seats, about one hundred fifty other cities and 
villages, and many rural schools; the deputy superintendent 
has also visited a majority of the counties and many cities 
and villages; but as there are ninety counties in Nebraska, 
450 graded schools employing two or more teachers, and more 
than 6,000 rural school districts in the state; and as there are 
more than 9,000 teachers annually employed and 22,000 school 
district officers; and as the department of public instruction is 
the clearing house for many of the troubles and trials and 
difficulties that arise in the conduct of school district affairs, 
I have endeavored to reduce the number of disputed points in 
school law and 'the irregularities of school proceedings by 
issuing printed circular letters of direction and warning at 
irregular intervals to county superintendents, to city superintendents 
and principals, to school district officers and to 
patrons of the schools. The Nebraska Teacher, a monthly 
magazine published at Lincoln with a circulation in the state 
of more than 5,000 copies, has been recognized as the official 
organ of this department for the publication of official decisions, 
notices, comments, etc. Extracts from the circular 
letters and of the official notices of more than passing interest 
are herewith appended. The official decisions are also published 
in this report.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, February 14, 1901. 

My Dear Superintendent: 

THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 

The key to the rural school problem may be turned by the 
ounty superintendent. Where real progress is you will find 
n earnest, honest, progressive county superintendent back of 
t. It is the desire of this department to lend a hand in the 
&gt;romotion of the great cause for which the common school 
was established — the salvation of our people and the perpetation 
of our republic. 

THE COMMON SCHOOL 

Our great state with its broad, fertile acres, its material 
wealth, its foundation for upbuilding, and its typical American 
homes, is the one place, owing to its favorable conditions and 
signal necessities, for the full outworking and culmination of 
the saving power of the'common school. The Common School 
is "of the people, by the people, for the people. " It is an 
American institution. It has come to stay. Opposition 
oppression, repressive conservatism have no place in our beloved 
state. The enterprising men and women who control it 
demand progress. Let our motto be, Forward ! March ! 

COURSE OF STUDY 

Permit me to urge that the State Course of Study be given 
special attention in your coming institute. Help teachers to 
become more familiar with the plan and purpose of this course 
of study. This will mean a more definite course of instruction 
in the ungraded schools. It will take nothing less than a herculean 
effort on the part of teachers and superintendents 
throughout the state to make this anywhere near a general 
success. A school will not grade itself. Patient, persistent 
labor will be required to reach the goal. Is not the end worth 
the effort? Hon.* Geo. A. Walton of Massachusetts says: 
"Actual results demonstrate that at least one year in six is 
gained in completing the ordinary branches of study even by 
an imperfect grading of schools." Hon. J. W. Akers of Iowa 
says: "Little can be done in the way of real prorgess in our 
district schools until the result of each teacher's work is made </seg>

a matter of record, so that a succeeding teacher may begin where 
the work closed and carry it forward." 

COMPETENT TEACHERS 

fut the most .potent factor of all in the advancement of 
nation is the teacher. ' 'The essence of a good school is in 
teacher. It is not in the course of study, nor in the fine 
school house, nor in the large library: it is in the teacher, in his 
methods, in his personal adaptation to the work of instruction, 
in his enthusiasm, in his ideals, in his personal worth. A 
school is the center of power only when it is in charge of a 
competent teacher. A teacher can do his duty to his pupils 
«ly when he feels that he was chosen, not on account of his 
litics, his religion, or of his relationship to the school board, 
but on account of his qualifications and natural fitness " 

Therefore, let us work together for more devoted, child - 
loving, professional teachers. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, March 14, 1901. 

Dear Sui&gt;eri)dendent or Principal: 

CO-OPERATE 

The Department of Public Instruction solicits the hearty cooperation 
of every superintendent and principal in Nebraska 
in working for the good of the graded schools of our beloved 
State. With your help we can render the people a service 
worthy our profession, but without it, our efforts may be in 
vain. Make any suggestions you please fur the good of the 
graded schools in particular and the cause of education in 
general. Criticise our publications freely. How may we improve 
them? 

EXCHANGE PUBLICATIONS 

Send us copies of all your printed matter and publications, 
manuals, courses of study, lists of teachers, school papers, and 
local papers which publish school items. By comparing notes 
and exchanging ideas we may advance education until in 
spirit and in truth it will be "the principal support of virtue, 
morality and civil liberty" throughout this noble commonwealth. 
Whenever and wherever we can assist you, command </seg>

            <seg id="p042">

us. We are ready to be with you in commencement exercises, 
educational rallies, and patrons' meetings. We hope to meet 
you at your district association this spring. Come with suggestions 
and questions. 

ARBOR DAY 

Let us urge that this first year of the twentieth century be 
made memorable in Nebraska by a fitting observance of Arbor 
Day. The indications at the present writing are that this 
spring will be a favorable one for tree-planting. Awaken 
your community in this matter. Urge your people to plant 
trees along the street, on the lawns, and in the parks. Let 
the school beautify the grounds by planting trees, shrubs and 
flowers. For a long time Nebraskans were snubbed by being 
called "Bug-Eaters." But to the Hon. Charles H. Sloan, of 
Geneva, belongs the honor of being the author of the resolution 
adopted by the legislature of 1895, which gave Nebraska 
a new name — "Tree Planter's State " 

J. STERLING MORTON 

To emphasize the importance of this day we quote the words 
of its author, the Hon. J. Sterling Morton : ' 'Arbor Day — 
Nebraska's own home-invented and home -instituted anniversary 
which has been already transplanted to nearly every state 
in the American Union, and even adopted in foreign lands, is 
not like otner holidays. Each of those reposes upon the past, 
while Arbor Day proposes for the future. It contemplates, 
not the good and the beautiful of past generations, but it 
sketcnes, outlines, establishes the useful and the beautiful for 
the ages yet to come. Other anniversaries stand with their 
backs to the future, peering into and worshiping the past; but 
Arbor Day faces the future with an affectionate solicitude, regarding 
it as an artist his canvas, and etches upon our prairies 
and plains gigantic groves and towering forests of waving 
trees, which shall for our posterity become consummate living 
pictures, compared to which the gorgeous colorings of Rubens 
are tame and insignificant. * * * As one friend hands to another 
a bouquet, so this anniversary sends greetings and 
flowers, foliage and fruit, to posterity. It is the sole holiday 
of the human family which looks forward and not backward." </seg>


            <seg id="p043">
39 

SCHOOL LIBRARY 

Another important matter is that of library and text books. 
Carlyle was right when he said : "The true University of these 
days is a collection of books." But be careful in their selec 
tion. None but the best should be allowed to occupy space in 
the school library. Do not neglect the grades: it is there that 
the love for good reading must have its origin. Let pupils be 
taught to frequent the company of their betters. "In books 
and life, that is the most wholesome society; let them learn to 
admire rightly ; the great pleasure of life is that. Teach them 
to note what great men admired ; they admired great things: 
narrow spirits admire basely and worship meanly." 

TEXT BOOKS 

There are text books in too many of our schools today 
valuable chiefly as relics. It is impossible to enumerate in 
this letter all of the n«w sciences, the new forces, new systems 
and new methods that have entered, and are about to enter, 
the domain of pedagogics through twentieth century text 
books. It is sufficient here to say, if your school is suffering 
from text books that are behind the times, awake your school 
board to their duty in fitting you out with the newest and best 
text books now on the market. Twentieth century boys and 
girls demand, among their inherent rights, twentieth century 

(JRADUATE THE BOYS 

How to keep the American high school from becoming 
female seminary is a serious problem. Few high schools are 
graduating more than one boy to three girls. To overcom 
this, let us put our courses of study in touch with the avenue 
ot&gt;en to young men and young women who graduate from ou 
high schools. There are those who will go to the University 
Some will enter the profession of teaching. Others will ente 
the business world. Let us acquaint ourselves with the cir 
cumstances and desires of pupils on their entrance to the hig 
school or as they may develop during their high school course 
Those who have the ability and means to go direct to colleg 
or university on graduation should be lined up for such 
course. Those who must teach before they can take universit </seg>

            <seg id="p044">

or normal training should be given some instruction during 
their high school course in pedagogy. Let them study the actual 
work of teaching by visiting the various grades in your 
own school. By a careful use of their time they may read two 
or three good works on methods of teaching. For those who 
will enter the business world, let us devote at least a part of 
the senior year to a course in actual business practice. In 
this manner we can hold boys and girls for graduation who 
would otherwise drop out before the junior year. And ultimately 
more would graduate from the high school and more 
will enter the university than to hold to -a course made dry and 
impractical to the demands of this age. The American high 
school is the poor man's college. Let us make it abreast the 
times in every line of work. 

TOP-HEAVY COURSES 

Do not be over-ambitious in the attempt to build up a High 
school with a four years' in a small city or village. 
A good two or three years' course would be much better. Do 
not overcrowd the course. If you teach Latin, for instance, 
throughout the four years, or the three, you cannot expect to 
teach everything else. Do not give the high school more than 
its share of attention. Remember the grades below. It 
would appear to be an abnormal condition when one-third or 
one-fourth of the teachers in a city or village are engaged exclusively 
in high school work. 

LECTURE COURSE 

Many high schools of the state are giving an intellectual 
activity to their respective communities by a first-class lecture 
course.*" Horace Mann claimed that the lecture platform is the 
people's college. Yes, it is more, it is the larger pulpit. It is 
the noblest advocate popular education has ever had. It 
stands for ability, genius, education, reform, entertainment. 

But whatever our course of study, whatever our plans, let us 
remember: "Knowledge does not comprise all which is contained 
in the large term of education. The feelings are to be 
disciplined ; the passions are to be restrained ; true and worthy 
motives are to be inspired; a profound religious feeling is to 
be instilled; and pure morality inculcated under all circumstances. 
All this is comprised in education." </seg>

            <seg id="p045">
41 


And whatever our advice to our teachers, let us never forget 
to impress upon them the true nobility of our calling. "If we 
work upon marble, it will perish; if we work upon brass, time 
will efface it; if we rear temples, they will crumble into dust; 
but if we work upon immortal minds, if we imbue them with 
the just fear of God and love of our fellowmen, we engrave on 
those tablets something which will brighten to all eternity. " 

Lincoln, Nebraska, April 19, 1901. 

My Dear Superintendent: 

NEW SCHOOL LAWS 

A new school law (House Roll No. 189) places United States 
History among the requirements for a third grade certificate; 
reduces the number of third grade certificates to which one 
person is entitled from three to two; makes attendance at teachers' 
county institutes compulsory; and after July 1, 1903, 
requires a knowledge of the Elements of Agriculture for first 
and second grade county certificates. 

teachers' contracts 

Senate File No. 256 provides that a teacher's contract made 
before the annual meeting, in order to be legal, must be signed 
by two "hold over" members of the board, — two whose terms 
of office do not expire with the annual meeting or the second 
Monday thereafter : it also provides that such contract must 
be agreed to by two members who are not related to the fourth 
degree (first cousins or nearer relationship) to the said teacher. 
Both these provisions are limited to districts organized under 
Subdivision III of the school laws, — districts having boards 
of three members. 

SIX-MILE LIMIT 

House Roll No. 223 removes the six-mile limit in the formation 
of^school districts, and increases the minimum assessed 
valuation-of new districts to $15,000. 

SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATIONS 

l"he attention of county superintendents is called particularly 
to House Roll No. 205, which sets forth the increased responsi- </seg>

bilities and duties of school boards and the implied new powers 
and duties of county superintendents. 

HIGH SCHOOL TUITION 

House Roll No. 322 makes provision for payment to high 
school districts of the tuition they earned under the last free 
high school attendance act, and is substantially a guarantee that 
no loss will accrue to any high school district which opens its 
doors under the provisions of the new act. 

UNION RURAL HIGH SCHOOLS 

Do not confuse the Union Rural High School act, House Roll 
No. 227, with the new Free High School Attendance act. House 
Roll No. 227 is purely an optional measure, and its provisions 
will be taken advantage of in very few counties of the state. 
It was passed without the emergency clause and therefore will 
not become effective until June 28, 1901. 

FREE HIGH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE LAW 

Free Attendance at Public High Schools of Non -Resident 
Pupils is provided for in House Roll No. 54. This measure is 
not all that its warmest friends desire, but they hope it is constitutional. 
This law states that "It shall be the duty of the 
state superintendent to determine annually what high schools 
• • * are subject to the provisions of this act. Schools having 
no more than eight grades or years of study shall, for the 
purposes of this act, be deemed common schools and schools 
having more than eight grades shall be deemed high schools. " 

RECOGNIZED HIGH SCHOOLS 

The state superintendent does not care to recognize (determine) 
!:h schools as subject to the provisions of this act that have 
y one year of high school work (ninth grade) employing in 
departments fewer than four teachers, nor except in excepaal 
cases does he care to recognize high schools having 
; two years 1 work (the ninth and tenth grades), and yet the 
er part of section 2 "deems" them high schools. The greatest 
akness of this measure lies in the fact that pupils living in 
istrict where they have a high school with grades of only 
; or two years (the ninth or ninth and tenth) cannot attend the 
venth and twelfth grades of another high school in a larger </seg>

Eor city in the county because the district of their residoes 
not form a part of the "adjunct district" ' of said 

ADJUNCT DISTRICT 

Each and every district in the county becomes or should become, 
under the provisions of this act, an independent high 
school district with its doors open to the graduates of the 
schools in the adjunct district (the rural schools) of the county, 
or it becomes a part of the adjunct district of the county. In the 
former case it 'receives pupils from the rural districts, in the 
latter case it sends its pupils to the nearest high school in the 
same county. It appears to me that it would be much better for 
districts having two, three or four departments, or one or two 
years of high school work, to become a part of the adjunct district 
of the county that it may send its graduates to a high 
school in the county having a four years' course. I shall rule 
that all districts in each county that are still organized under 
Subdivision III should form a part of the adjunct district of 
said county, and must vote on the establishment of an adjunct 
district on Monday, June 24, the date of the annual meeting. 
Blank form No. 21 will be furnished by this department on 
which the moderator shall certify the vote to the county superintendent. 
City superintendents should see to it that their 
school boards vote upon the question of opening the«r high 
schools for the instruction of non-resident pupils under the 
provisions of this act immediately after the re-organization of 
the new board, and I hope they will use their influence to secure 
an affirmative vote. County superintendents should 
impress upon their district ooard members, more particularly 
the moderators, their duties in carrying out the provisions of 
section 4 : ' 'It is hereby made the duty of the moderator of each 
common school district in this state to submit the question of 
the establishment of an adjunct district in the county in which 
it js located to a vote of the legal voters of his district at the 
annual meeting of said district next occurring after the taking 
effect of this act, and to certify the result of such vote to the 
county superintendent.'" I hope each county superintendent 
will notify this department of the result of the vote in his 
county. Temporarily at least I shall recognize all high schools </seg>

recognized during the last administration under the provisions 
of the last free high school attendance act in Class A , B, C or 
D, as indicated in the Nebraska Educational Directory for 1899-1900, 
provided they are organized under subdivision 6, 14, or 
17, as public high schools under the provisions of this act. 
School districts that wish to change their organization from 
the conditions and provisions under subdivision 3 to those of 
subdivision 6 must do so at the annual meeting, if at all. 

THE DEAF— THE BLIND 

Permit me to call the attention of county superintendents to 
their duties as stated in section 14 of subdivision 7, and superintendents 
in metropolitan cities and in cities of the first 
and second classes should co-operate with the county superintendents 
in these reports. The superintendent of the Nebraska 
School for the Deaf at Omaha is R. E. Stewart, and of the 
Nebraska School for the Blind at Nebraska City is J. T. 
Morey. 

BLANKS AND SUPPLIES 

County superintendents will take notice that in some cases 
they will not receive all the blanks they have asked for because 
we deem their demands extravagant, and in distributing the 
same they must not be either wasteful or extravagant. This 
department estimates closely and carefully the number of each 
of the different blank forms required, and furnishes the same 
with a sufficient allowance. Where a single blank is required 
for each of the 7,000 districts in the state, we print not to exceed 
10,000, which is not a sufficient number for all county 
superintendents to send two or three to each district. The 
new supply of blanks will be sent out from this office about the 
middle of May, and the revised edition of the school laws 
about the same time. Institute Directories will be distributed 
early in May. 

We shall be pleased to have all superintendents confer 
freely with us on educational matters, and call on us at any 
time when in Lincoln.

colleges teachers' state certificates, under certain limitations, 
•"our years ago a bill (H. R. 333) was passed granting gradutes 
of incorporated colleges, universities and normal schools 
with $100,000 invested, etc., state certificates. But one intitution 
has taken advantage of this provision. Other sections 
f the school laws grant graduates of the University of Neraska 
and of the State Normal School state and professional 
ertificates. Now appeareth another measure, House Roll 386, 
which repealeth all these sections above referred to, and 
eaveth as the. only possible means of securing a teacher's 
ertificate the county or state superintendent's examination, 
r that of the examining committwe of the board of education 
n cities. In brief, the faculty of our own state university or 
ur normal school are less competent, after four years' acquainance 
with a student, to determine whether or no he should 
be granted a certificate to teach than we superintendents, 
fttimes creatures or creations of a political convention, after 
ight hours' examination of an applicant of whose personlity 
we may know little or nothing, whom we "shall deem 
ualified with respect to good moral character, learning and 
bility to instruct and govern a school:' thus is it written! 

From The Nebraska Teacher for April. 1901. 

SCHOOL BOND INTEREST RATES 

Hereafter, in conformity with the decision of the attorney 
general, the auditor of public accounts of the state will decline 
to register any school district bond drawing interest at a rate 
exceeding six per cent per annum. 

THE NEW SCHOOL LAWS 

A circular or folder containing the new school laws enacted 
by the legislature of the state at their late session will be 
printed and distributed about April 15th. In the next issue 
of the Nebraska Teacher we will publish some comments on 
the laws passed and those that failed of passage. 

EIGHTH GRADE EXAMINATIONS 

tWe hope the county superintendents of the state will endeavto 
preserve and increase the interest in eighth grade examations 
for graduation from the rural schools in the intervals

between the various free high school attendance laws as well 
as during their short-lived and precarious existence. 

EXCHANGE CIRCULARS 

It would be a great mutual assistance if, during the rest of 
the school year, each county superintendent would have 
printed one hundred extra copies of all his circulars and 
other publications, whether hektographed, mimeographed or 
printed matter, and send a copy to each of the other county 
superintendents of the state. Let each superintendent know 
what his co-workers are doing. 

CHART AGENT 

A chart agent has been roaming the counties west of Lincoln 
during the past month, not only seeking whom he might 
devour, but devouring all or nearly all of those he saw. The 
gentleman claims to have a recommendation from the state 
superintendent but the records and letter copybooks of this 
office show nothing of the sort. We think he is mistaken, and 
his conduct impels us to the following decision for self-protection 
: henceforth, we will refuse to write, dictate, grant, or 
sign any testimonials or recommendation whatsoever of any 
school charts, without regard to their merit, color, or prospect 
of servitude, — that is, usefulness. 

From The Nebraska Teacher for May, 1901. 

RECOGNIZED HIGH SCHOOLS 

Inasmuch as section 1 of House Boll No. 54, the new free 
high school attendance act, provides that non-resident pupils 
shall attend the nearest high school of approved grade in the 
county, and inasmuch as section 2 requires the state superintendent 
to determine annually what high schools meet the requirements 
of section 1, the state superintendent has recognized 
all high schools recognized during the last administration, 
provided, they are organized under section 6, 14 or 
17 of the school laws. 

SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT 

The sixteenth biennial report of the state superintendent to 
the governor of Nebraska was distributed the past month.

raska are found among the opening pages of the volume, followed 
by the offide force of the last administration. Some 
fine cuts of the best school buildings in the state are scattered 
through the report. It includes, as usual, ex- Superintendent 
Jackson's biennial report of various matters, county institutes, 
special day programs, new high school manual, reports from 
various county and city schools, state institutions for delinquents 
and defectives, the state normal and university of Nebraska, 
statistical tables, and reports of private schools. 

PROPOSED SCHOOL LEGISLATION 

A few school bills introduced during the last session of the 
legislature failed of passage. They will be again introduced 
in^l903. They included such changes as county superintendents' 
examinations quarterly instead of monthly; establishing 
a minimum age for teachers at seventeen years; changing 
the entrance age of pupils to the schools from five to six 
years, and decreasing the number of board members in high 
schools districts from six to five. This latter change would 
provide for one member being elected each year for a term of 
five years. If the entrance age for children is raised to six 
years, some specific legislation governing the admission of 
kindergartners under that age should be enacted ; otherwise, 
their admission at public expense may be called into question. 
We would be pleased to correspond with superintendents on 
these and other matters of prospective school legislation. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, May 10, 1901. 

My Dear Superintendent: 

EIGHTH GRADE TO NINTH 

Promotion from the Eighth grade to the High School should 
be a clearly defined step. Pupils are often permitted to slide 
along from year to year through the eight grades, but in the 
eighth grade, where in a well graded school all common 
school subjects are completed, there should be called a "halt." 
I believe that no other one thing that is possible and jpracticable 
would do as much for the public schools of Nebraska as to 
have it well understood that the eighth grade is not necessarily 
the eighth year, a division of the course to be completed </seg>

            <seg id="p054">
48 


in a term of nine months, nor that it is a year of preparation 
for the High School. (Let us drop this idea 6f preparation for 
something else.) But let us have it thoroughly understood 
that the Eighth grade is a place for the satisfactory, intelligent 
cowpleti'm of all common school subjects, and that it is no disgrace 
for a pupil to remain there two years. I believe no 
other one thing would raise the standard of our high school 
work so rapidly and so thoroughly as to keep about sixty per 
cent of our pupils in the eighth grade two years. 

PUPILS' AGE IN HIGH SCHOOL 

Istablish a minimum age for admission to the High school, 
thirteen years. Many of the rural district, non-resident 
ils compare favorably with those of the city or village bele 
they have gone over their higher arithmetic, geography, 
nmar, history and physiology two or three winters in 
ession, and are more mature than their city cousins. In 
mon school subjects I wish to include reading, writing, 
ling.written and mental arithmetic, geography, U. S. his, 
English grammar aud composition, and physiology, 
t prosody in grammar, but emphasize the ability to read, 
e and speak the English language correctly, and to spell, 
erintendents and principals should be firm in requiring 
ils to go over a years work a second time when it has been 
indifferently completed. 

EIGHTH GRADE GRADUATION 

In cities and villages there should be held an examination 
for promotion from the eighth grade to the high school, as 
rigid as that required by the county superintendent for graduation 
from the rural school, and with special emphasis on the 
pupil's knowledge and use of the English language. It might 
tend to increase the interest to have graduating or closing exercises 
for the pupils who complete the eighth grade or 
grammar school course, held in the high school room rather 
than in a public hall or an opera house. Certificates of the 
completion of the work should be granted, giving final grades, 
either of examination, or based partly upon examination and 
partly upon class work, entitling the holder to admission to 
the high school without further examination. </seg>

            <seg id="p055">

TWO-YEAR HIGH SCHOOLS 

Villages employing from three to six teachers should not 
attempt to do more than two years of high school Work, unless 
in exceptional cases. Particularly where the principal is required 
to teach all or a part of the eighth grade subjects, he 
should not be required nor should he attempt to go beyond the 
tenth grade. Many inq uiries are received at this office relative 
to a two-years' course for high schools. Permit me to suggest 
the following : Ninth grade, advanced English grammar with 
Klish literature and composition, civil government and 
[keeping, algebra, physical geography ; Tenth grade, rhe$, 
algebra and plane geometry, botany and zoology, general 
history. Teach these well and do not worry. 

SCHOOL NEWS 

school news column in a local or county newspaper is 
ly preferable to a school paper published by yourself, 
newspaper is more widely disseminated, and catches the 
attention of those not directly interested in the schools. It 
relieves you of financial worrying and the necessity of "padding" 
to fill up four pages of a school paper. There is no difficulty 
for an issue or two to furnish enough matter, but after 
that the printer's cry for "more copy" will vex you and tempt 
you to spread out your ideas very thin. 

Please report promptly to this department when your board 
votes to open the door of your high school under the provisions 
of the new free high school attendance law, House Roll No. "&gt;4. 

Members of Nebraska School District Boards: 

Gentlemen — This department urges upon you the import- 
Kof studying and observing the school law in the transae 
of your official business. Were the district meeting, the 
ict board, the director, the moderator, and the treasurer 
to comply with all the requirements of the Business Calendar, 
printed on pages 5, 6, 7, and 8 of our School Laws, many 
petty quarrels and much of the serious trouble that usually 
follows the annual meeting, often working a detriment to the 
schools throughout the year, might be avoided. Therefore, 

June 1, 1901. </seg>

            <seg id="p056">
50 


know well the law and follow it, governing the district meeting 
and the district board thereby. Let each officer acquaint 
himself thoroughly with the law regarding his own duties as 
a servant of the people. 

NEW SCHOOL LAWS 

The new school laws impose new duties. The annual meeting 
must vote on the question of the establishment of an adjunct 
district in the county for free high school privileges, in all 
districts not approved by this department as free public high 
school districts. There is a new law on teacher's contract; a 
new compulsory attendance law, 'requiring new data in the 
census report; a new law which removes the six-mile limit in 
the formation of school districts ; a new law which makes it 
the duty of school officers to attend business meetings called 
by the county superintendent; and a new law compelling 
teachers to attend institutes. These new laws increase the 
duties, the responsibilities, and the opportunities of school 
officers. 

YOUR REPORTS 

There are many things on different reports which must be 
attended to within ten days after the annual meeting. Exercise 
more care in making out these reports. Get them in on 
time. See that the officers-elect qualify within the proper 
time. It would be well for the directors to meet their respective 
county superintendents at convenient places in their respective] 
counties and make out these reports in the presence 
of the superintendent. Many county superintendents meet their 
officers for this purpose. It is an excellent plan and does away 
with many vexing problems and delays for both director and 
superintendent. Transact no other official business during that 
time. ' But space will not permit us to go further into details. 
You have access to a copy of the law. We have added an appendix 
to the School Laws for 1901-02, quoting a'number of decisions 
by the^Supreme Court of Nebraska on important educational 
'matters, which we hope will serve as a lamp by which 
schoorofficers may be guided, and thus make their troubles for 
the future less annoying than have been in the past. 
Therefore, know the law ; then follow it. </seg>

51 

P regret that the supply of School Laws is so limited. 
is but one copy for each of the seven thousand school 
;s. This copy is to be kept in the custody of the school 
, and produced by them at all meetings of the district. 
t this copy of the laws be passed along from officer to 
until each one is acquainted with the duties of his office. 

TEXT-BOOKS, SUPPLIES, AND APPARATUS. 

Under our present free text-book law, this subject is one of 
great importance. Experience proves that, where proper care 
is exercised by the school board and the teacher, this law is 
popular and satisfactory ; but it becomes a detriment and a 
nuisance whenever pupils carelessly soil, mark, deface, or 
destroy the bqbks. See that teachers appeal to the pride of 
their pupils; that they insist on habits of neatness and cleanliness 
; that they make a regular inspection of books, at least 
once a month — no other agency is more effective than a regular 
book inspection. Teachers should also hold pupils responsible 
for preserving and returning books in good condition, by a 
proper use of the Permanent Text-Book Record. School boards 
should furnish each school room with a book case. We urge 
upon school officers the importance of furnishing their schools 
with up-to-date text-books You should no more expect pupils 
and teachers to work with text-books that are behind the times 
than you should think of throwing aside the self-binder or 
check-rower to return to the implements used by your fathers. 
Modern text-books are as necessary as modern farming implements. 


See that your school is properly furnished with natural slate 
blackboards, charts, maps, globes, dictionaries, and two or 
three magazines and periodicals. The slate blackboard is 
the best and cheapest in the end. But we warn you not to purchase 
any supplies, charts, or apparatus from agents without 
a meeting of your board ; and then not at $47. 50 a chart, nor 
half that amount. 

SCHOOL HOUSE AND GROUNDS 

Section 13 of subdivision 4 of the School Laws makes it 
the duty of the district board to provide the necessary appendages 
for the school house and to keep the same in good condition 
and repair during the time school shall be taught. But </seg>

            <seg id="p058">
52 


why let the school house and the school grounds become like 
a forgotten cemetery during the summer? Mow the grass and 
weeds. Paint and plaster the school house, hang the door on 
its hinges, repair the lock, build up the chimney, straighten up 
the lightning rod, put in the window glass, blacken the stove 
and pipe, replace that brick with a new stove foot, provide 
poker and ash pan, fix the doorstep, rebuild or remove the 
fences, beautify the grounds by planting trees ; encourage the 
children to plant trees, vines, and flowers ; and, above all, we insist 
on healthful conditions for both mind and body at the outhouses; 
they should cease to be hell-holes of vulgarity and 
obscenity, which is too often the case. 

THE KIND OF SCHOOL OFFICERS NEEDED 

Without wide-awake, interested school officers, our schools 
can not make much progress. We are glad that we have so 
many officers who are truly interested in the welfare of the 
schools. We want school officers who will uphold the teacher 
in all reasonable rules and regulations, even if the penalty fall 
on the heads of their own children. We want school officers 
who will encourage the teacher in professional reading and 
in attendance at teachers' meetings and institutes. Yes, 
officers who to ill insist on these things rather tftan opix&gt;se them. We 
want officers who will themselves read educational journals 
and keep in touch with the newest and best methods in education, 
and who will attend educational meetings called by 
their county superintendents. At least we want school officers 
who will visit their own schools and thus know for a certainty 
whether the school is a success or a failure ; and we want 
officers who will cooperate with the county superintendent on 
all school matters. 

THE "NEED OF THE HOUR 

The soul of a gocd school is the teacher; therefore, the need 
of the hour is educated, professionally-trained teachers; 
teachers who have a love for the work ; teachers whose characters 
are above reproach ; teachers who are strong physically as 
well as intellectually; teachers — large-hearted, God-fearing, 
liberty-loving. 

See those hundreds of well qualified American teachers on 
their way to the Philippines to teach the Filipino ! They are 
</seg>


            <seg id="p061">
53 


either normal school or college graduates; they have had sev" 
eral years experience in school work ; they are physically sound ; 
their ability and their fitness for positions are shown by the 
testimonials of educators. These are the qualifications which 
Uncle Sam requires of his one thousand teachers before they 
can teach the Filipinos ! But a third grade certificate and a 
contract signed by Uncle John and two other members of the 
district board is often sufficient in Nebraska. Why do not 
"we, the people,"' demand as well qualified teachers for the 
girls and boys in the rural schools of Nebraska as Uncle Sam 
does for his savage children in far away Luzon? 

IN CONCLUSION 

In conclusion, permit us to offer in brief form these and 
other suggestions, as follows : 

(1) Consult the school laws 

(2) Refer to the Business Calendar. 
(3) Note particularly the new school laws. 

(4) Report promptly after the annual meeting to the county 
superintendent. 

(5) Keep the school house and other district property in good 
repair. 

(6) Secure the best teacher in your part of the state, and 
pay her the highest wages you can afford. 

(7) A school term of six months with an excellent teacher 
may secure better results than a terra of eight moaths with an 
indifferent or a poor one. 

(8) Elect a teacher for the year, when possible, instead of 
for a term of three months. Many excellent teachers do not 
begin to do the best work until the second or third month of 
their term. 

(9) Endeavor to run your school more continuously. 
Vacations for corn husking, at the Christmas holidays, and in 
the spring break up the school work too much and interfere 
with results. 

(10) Enforce the Compulsory Attendance law. 
(11) Every school room should have a bookcase. 

(12) Purchase new, noiseless desks. The old rattle-traps 
make a noisy, disorderly school. </seg>

            <seg id="p062">
54 


* (13) Make a house-to-house canvass this year, when taking 

the school census. 

(14) School officers should 
their other meetings. 

visit teachers' institutes and 

(15) Make no expenditures 
majority of the board after all 
discussed the subject together. 

except when authorized by a 
three members have met and 

(16) The director's estimate of the expenses should be included 
in the minutes of the annual meeting as well as the 
action taken thereon by the voters. 

(17) We hope you will read The Nebraska Teacher. It 
contains the recent official decisions in school law, a school 
board department, and other matters of interest to Nebraska 
schools. 

(18) If finances permit, provide a small library for your 
school. 

(19) The voters present at the annual meeting should not attempt 
to bind you in the selection of a teacher or the wages to 
be paid, even by suggestion. .It is your prerogative. 

(20) The certificate of taxation must have two signatures at 
least before it is filed with the county clerk. 

(21) Consult your county superintendent more in the selection 
of a teacher, the selection and purchase of books, supplies, 
etc. 

(22) Keep your school house fuel under cover. Do you 
pay one dollar a load for cobs and two dollars for hauling them? 

Let us work together in our efforts to secure better facilities 
for the school children and better results in the school rooms 
of Nebraska. Very respectfully, 

WM. K. FOWLER, State Superintendent. 
J. L. McBRIEN, Deputy.

SCHOOL LAW, 1901 

The school laws and school land laws, as revised and amended 
in 1901, will be ready for distribution in a few days. The publication 
will include explanatory notes and citations as heretofore, 
and also some important supreme court decisions on 
matters of educational interest. </seg>

TO SCHOOL OFFICERS 

This department has had printed 25,000 copies of a circular 
letter, one for each member of each school district board and 
board of education in the state of Nebraska. These "circular 
letters have been sent to the county superintendents with their 
supplies and should be distributed by them to their board mem - 
bers. 

SCHOOL LAW FOR TEACHERS 

From the revised school laws of Nebraska we have selected 
some sections of special interest and importance to teachers, 
which we have had published in a pamphlet of twenty-four 
pages, entitled "School Law for^ Teachers. " We have had 
printed 10,000 copies which will be distributed to the teachers 
of the state during the summer at the annual institutes. 

THREE- YEAR HIGH SCHOOL 

Principals of village schools where there are from three to 
six teachers should discourage their .boards from adding the 
eleventh grade or year to their course of study, more particularly 
where the principal is required to teach tbe eighth grade, 
and no principal can teach, unaided and successfully, the ninth, 
tenth, and eleventh grades and give the primary and grammar 
grades any care, thought, or supervision. In too many cases 
the principal in a village school is not a principal : he is simply 
the teacher of the highest room. 

STATE EXAMINATIONS 

Examinations for state professional certificates will be held 
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, June 13, 14, "and 15, in the 
office of the state superintendent at Lincoln, and in the high 
school buildings at Norfolk, Kearney, and North Platte. Professor 
Condra will have charge of the examination at Lincoln, 
Superintendent O'Connor at Norfolk, Superintendent 
at Kearney, and Superintendent Bertha Thoelecke at North 
Platte. For further particulars and a circular of the examinations 
and requirements for professional certificates write to 
the state superintendent.

GRADUATING EXERCISES

of the high school graduating exercises if the presentation </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

of flowers and other gifts were postponed until after benediction; 
and also if programs were printed and distributed, and 
all of the announcements by superintendent or principal of 
parts on program were omitted. 

SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 

During the past month I have visited in about twenty-five 
counties in the state, and crossed in railroad trains nearly as 
many others. In many cases the condition of school buildings 
can and should be materially improved. In the eastern half of 
the state there are still many treeless grounds; there are some 
unpainted schoolhouses, and a larger number of unpainted fuel 
sheds and outbuildings; and from a car window I have noted a 
number of schoolhouses with only one outbuilding. (See Subdivision 
5, section 6a, School Laws. ) 

INSTITUTE JANITORS 

County superintendents and institute directors should 
endeavor to secure the best possible janitor service during 
their institutes. The buildings in which the institutes are 
held should be swept each evening and dusted each morning, 
as school rooms are or should be. Fresh drinking water should 
be provided, with and without ice. Janitors should be instructed 
to erase blackboards each evening, and to wash them 
if necessary ; this will be doubly valuable in that it will remove 
daily the witticisms(?) that sometimes remain there until they 
smell — of age. Employ a good janitor and pay him a good 
wage. 

OLD-FASHIONED GRADUATION 

It has been my experience this spring that the people, at 
least in the smaller cities and villages, prefer the old-fashioned 
graduating exercises, including orations and other numbers 
on the program by the graduates, to an address or a lecture 
by foreign talent. A lecture is a good thing, but have it in the 
winter, in a course with four or five others. And as far as 
possible, the entire program of the graduating exercises, including 
music, should be given by the graduates. If the class 
does not contain the talent, use undergraduates; if necessary, 
go into the eighth grade; but do not use talent outside the 
school if you can avoid it. </seg>

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTI&lt; 

57 

From The Nebraska Teacher for August. IS .1 

During the season thus far the deputy state superintendent 
has visited teachers' institutes in the counties of ( 'ass. Caster, 
Harlan, Loup, tfuckolls, Pawnee, and Sherman. During 
August he will visit many more. 

NEGLECT OF SCHOOLHi " 

In some dilapidated frame and sod school houses the evident 
neglect of the district board is absolutely criminal, th« apparent 
indifference of the people no less so, and the attempt* 
of the teacher to improve the material conditions and to dec 
orate the schoolrooms truly pathetic. 

INSTITUTES VISITED. 

During the past three weeks the state superintendent baa 
visited the teacners' institutes in the counties of Box Batte, 
Cuming, Dawes, Dundy, Hall, Hayes, Keith, Ruck, and 
Thayer. He had planned to visit Boyd, Kimball, sod Pierce 
counties also during the same time, bat poor nt«gti comer 
tions interfered with a visit to the first, and th«&gt; two other institutes 
were postponed. In several of these counties, in company 
with the county superintendent, the state superintendent 
drove out and visited several of the ea— trjr school 
houses. 

HOME-MADE SCHOOL DESKS. 

In a large number of school houses in the western part of 
the state, home-made desks are still in use. These desks, including 
the book shelf, are made of one- inch board*. usually 
planed on one side only. The desk top is sometimes level. 
sometimes slopes at an angle varying from a fow degrees to 
(in one case) nearly fifty degrees. The backs of the desks sad 
seats are flat, — not a curve in them. The entire desk is cfie 
and ungainly, without ink well or place for one, without pea 
rack or groove, and they are usually loose from the floor.

In pursuance of a measure enacted at the last session of the 
state legislature, the proposition to constitute all of the territory 
of each county outside the high school districts as an independent 
taxing district, to be known as the adjunct district 
of such county, was submitted to the legal voters of the districts 
at the annual meeting. Monday, June 24, 1901. In 
every county in the state, with one exception, the proposition 
was defeated. In Douglas county it was carried by a vote of 

Some of the features of the law are as follows : 

I he adjunct district of county would include 
he common school districts organized under Subdivision 
with a board of three members ; . this would be a single, 
ipendent district, in no way affecting or interfering with 
work or organization of each individual district. The adit 
district would be organized solely that a tax of not to 
»ed two mills on the dollar of assessed valuation might 
sgally levied and collected, for the purpose of paying the 
on of the graduates of the rural or common schools at 
nearest approved high school in the county. The adjunct 
rict has no officers; it builds no schoolhouses ; it votes no 

The law also provides for the recognition or approval of 
properly equipped high schools by the state superintendent, for 
a vote by their boards on the opening of their high school to 
non-residents without charge to them, for determining the cost 
of tuition, etc. 

Iie law was defeated on account of lack of information, 
inderstanding, indifference, and opposition to even a tax of 
mills or less to pay the tuition of a few rural school 
luates at the village or city high schools. Many districts 
sed to vote on the question. In many the law was cond 
with the Rural High School measure, Subdivision VI, 
;ions 9-19 (House Boll No. 227). In others the opinion 
'ailed that it meant consolidation of districts and transpor 
&gt;n of pupils. Many voters thought it benefited the high 
kjI districts at the expense of the rural districts. 

Many county superintendents are of the opinion that 
the proposition to establish an adjunct district should be submitted 
again next June at the annual meeting. They believe </seg>

that then the law will be better understood, and therefore 
will meet with favorable consideration. They advocate explanations 
of its value and importance during the school year 
at associations of teachers and school board members, and 
publication of matter relative thereto in the county papers. 
Several superintendents have estimated that the levy in their 
counties need not exceed one-half mill.

My Dear Superintendent, or Principal: 

GREETINGS AND SUGGESTIONS 

I Phe opening of another school year is upon us. We extend 
you our heartiest greetings and best wishes for the success 
the schools under your supervision. Permit us to make a 
v statements, suggestions and recommendations relative to 
ucational matters in Nebraska during the current year as 
jwed by this department. 

READ OUR CIRCULARS 

Ee hope that each county and city superintendent and prin- 
L will read carefully every letter, circular and pamphlet </seg>

            <seg id="p074">
64 


I; to him (or her) from this office and then file the same for 
ire reference. Read also the notes and official decisions 
lished in the State Superintendent's Department of The 
raska Teacher. Hand newspaper editors and reporters 
;s of this and other circulars and publications of this 
irtment that you think would be of interest to the general 
lie. You are welcome to extra copies for this purpose, 
would be pleased to receive copies of all printed matter 
nating from your office or your schools. We can furnish 
with copies of the new Game Law of the state. 

A BAD TENDENCY 

I at us emphasize again the recommendations of this departt 
relative to promotions from the Eighth grade to the 
h School, and the Course of Study in villages employing 
a three to six teachers. See our circular of May 10, 1901. 
b also our circular of March 14, 1901. We also commend 
our careful consideration the state courses of study for high 
x)ls as outlined in the Nebraska Higb School Manual, 
ed jointly by the state university and this department, 
d the criticism made therein by Inspector J. W. Crabtree 
bat part of his report entitled, "A Bad Tendency." The 
rersity authorities should also give serious thought to this 
i of Inspector Crabtree 's report. 

CORBETT'S REPORT BOOK 

We are sending to the principals of all schools employing 
ten teachers or less, sufficient copies of the Teacher's Report 
Book for use during the coming year. We trust that every 
teacher will keep this record accurately from day to day. It 
will take less than two minutes a day, and by its use the weekly, 
monthly and term summaries will no longer prove a burden. 
Besides, an accurate knowledge of the attendance and punctuality 
of as chool usually brings about a united effort on the part 
of the teacher and pupils to raise the per cent and keep it as 
high as possible. There is much room for improvement in the 
matter of average daily attendance. All principals or superintendents 
not receiving these Report Books, who desire them, 
may obtain the same by addressing this department. This 
book is the same as issued by Ex-Supt. Corbett. </seg>

            <seg id="p075">

CARE OF TEXT BOOKS 

"A stitch in time saves nine." When looking over the text 
books, did you notice those torn pages and loose covers? 
Attend to them mnc, before they go into the hands of the children, 
and you will save yourself much future labor, the district 
many books, and the taxpayers many dollars. 

IMPURE WATER 

Many cases of sickness may be attributed to impure drinking 
water. Remember that in the majority of cases the wells 
I hydrants at the schoolhouses have not been used during 
ation, and that the water is very likely stagnant and unfit 
use. See to it before school begins that a supply of pure, 
ih water is available. 

TEXT BOOK PRICE LISTS 

Many of the textbook publishers doing business in the state 
K Nebraska have had printed and have furnished this departnt 
with copies of their price lists for distribution to the 
100I districts of the state through the county superintendents, 
under the provisions of our free textbook law. We will be 
pleased to forward them on application. It is possible to order 
a variety of textbooks from different publishing houses in the 
same city (Chicago, for instance, )and have them all come in 
one package or box and shipment. Ask one firm to send the 
package to another firm for enclosure, and ask the other firm 
to enclose a package from this firm. County superintendents 
should inform their district boards of this possibility. 

PHOTOGRAPHS WANTED 

|[t is our intention to publish at some time during the winter 
mmphlet on Rural and Village Schools, their architecture, 
iterial, grounds, furnishings, etc. The pamphlet will be 
til illustrated. It will contain illustrations of the best, the 
erage, and the poorest school buildings of me state that are 
kde of stone, of br'ck, of wood, and of sod. We want photoaphs 
of typical and school buildings from 
sections of the state. We want also interior views, reprenting 
the two extremes of tasteful decoration and of criminal 
gleet. We want some views that will show the condition of 
b grounds and the outbuildings. The publication will be </seg>

and disadvantages under which the schools "and school people 
labor in different parts of the state. Send us some photographs. 
We will have the cuts made, and the photographs 
will form part of a permanent exhibit in this office. Or, loan 
us cuts if you have them. 

BUSINESS MEETING 

I^e intend to call a business meeting of the county superinients 
and the county superincendents-elect for Monday 
ning and Tuesday forenoon and afternoon. December 30 
31, 1901 "(just preceding the sessions of the Nebraska 
te Teachers' Association), for the purpose of discussing 
teachers' county institute, joint institutes, times and places 
holding either, instructors etc. ; also the rural school, the 
ldings and grounds, furniture, apparatus, etc. All county 
erintendents of and for the ensuing term (1902-1903) will be 
lected to attend this meeting and outgoing superintendents 
I be welcome. 

HOME AND SCHOOL 

The proper co-operation of the home is a necessary factor in 
the success of the school. Patrons' meetings offer a splendid 
opportunity to enlist the interest and sympathy of parents in 
school matters. Let the home join hands with the school on 
this motto: "The School first, Society afterwards. " Let the 
home stand by the school in a reasonable amount of home 
study by pupils in the Grammar grades and in the High School. 
Hon. H. H . Shedd, president of the Ashland board of education, 
has this to say for home study: 

HOME STUDY 

"If the high school had no other purpose except to furnish 
the young with constant employment in the evening, it would 
be no small advantage. In so far as it requires their close 
attention at home, it is a splendid co-worker with the parent. 
It would be a moral calamity if there were no studying at night. 
It is a safeguard to many young people. Welcome the hardest 
work that the high school requires if it shall be the incentive 
that keeps the young person faithfully at home and at work </seg>


            <seg id="p077">
67 

during the evening. There are no bad companionships mixed 
up with Latin or algebra. There is no fear or danger connected 
with the study of literature or science." 

DAILY ABSENCE 

The school census of Nebraska for 1900 was 377,791. The 
enrollment in the public schools for that year was 288,227. 
This would leave 89,564 children of school age not enrolled. 
The average daily attendance was 181,874. This would make 
the average daily absences, as. based upon the total enrollment, 
106,353. Add to this the number not enrolled, and we have an 
army of 195,917 boys and girls between the ages of five and 
twenty-one absent from the schools in this state each and every 
half day while school was in session during the school year of 
1899-1900. And let it be remembered that the average daily 
attendance for that year was not cut down by smallpox epidemic 
as it was during the past year. After every reasonable 
excuse possible, these figures still present an appalling situation. 
We hope that a strict observance and rigid enforcement 
of the compulsory attendance law will remedy this evil. 

WILL ATTEND TEACHERS' MEETINGS 

We, or either of us, will be pleased to accept any and all invitations 
to attend and address county, district and other teachers' 
associations, where dates do not conflict, and where office 
and other duties will permit, but we are compelled to ask these 
Kciations to bear our local expenses. The pace maintained 
ng the past institute season has nearly exhausted the 
ger Legislative appropriation for traveling expenses, and 
the small amount now on hand we wish to reserve for the next 
institute season. This request, or arrangement, therefore, 
for our local expenses, is for the period from September 1, 
1901, to June 1, 1902. ~"

any church edifice, school house, dwelling house, or other 
building, its fixtures, books or appurtenances, or shall commit 
B nuisance therein, or shall purposely and maliciously comany

McKINLEY MEMORIAL EXERCISES 

Lincoln, Neb., Sept. 16, 1901. 

To All Superintendents, Principals and Teachers in the 
Public Schools of Nebraska: The republic mourns its thirjl 
martyred president; humanity weeps over the death of 
friend; law and order, the citadel of liberty, sorrow becausv 
the voice of their advocate is hushed ; every true American is 
heart-broken and appalled at this awful crime. 

Therefore, the president of the United States and the governor 
of the state of Nebraska have proclaimed Thursday, the 
19th of September, 1901, as a day to be devoted to memorial 
exercises and prayer on account of our great national bereavement. 
The public schools of the state are hereby earnestly 
requested to huld memorial exercises on that day if in session, 
or if dismissed for the day, on the afternoon preceding or </seg>

the forenoon following Thursday. Let the exercises comprise 
patriotic selections, national hymns and songs and sketches of 
the martyrdom of Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. But on 
this occasion let special emphasis be given to the life, character 
and career of William McKinley, his ancestry, place and 
date of birth, boyhood, youth, as a school teacher, as a private 
soldier, as lieutenant, captain, major, as lawyer, congressman, 
governor, as president, as husband, as a man. The daily 
press of the last week furnish ample material for such a program. 
In rural schools where the school house is the usual 
place for public meetings, or in villages where services may 
not be held by the public, invite patrons and citizens to join 
the school in its exercises. 

While we extol the virtues of the dead, let us not forget our 
•duty to the living. This is a time which calls for "the better 
angels of our nature" to control our utterances. Freedom of 
speech and press is too often abused. License is mistaken for 
liberty. Obedience to law must be accepted as a typical 
American virtue and in the proper enforcement uf law every 
true American will always lend a hand. 

Despite the terrible calamity which has overtaken us, let us 
not forget that God reigns and the government at Washington 
still lives. The immortal words of Garfield that stopped a mob 
of ten thousand maddened men in New York city, when the 
news of President Lincoln's assassination reached that place, 
April 15, 1865,demand our consideration and attention in times 
like these : 

" Fellow citizens ! Clouds and darkness are 'roundabout him! 
His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies! 
Justice and judgment are the establishment of his throne! 
Mercy and truth shall go before his face! Fellow citizens! 
God reigns and the government at Washington still lives." 

But careful consideration and due deliberation of problems 
confronting us must not be carried to the extent of making us 
cowards. The American people have never shirked their duty 
in the solution of grave problems and they never will. How 
the words of William McKinley inspire us to do our duty even 
in the face of danger. 

"It is sometimes hard to determine what is best to do and the 
best thing to do is oftentimes the hardest. The prophet of evil </seg>

tild do nothing because be flinches at sacrifice and effort 
to do nothing is easiest and involves the least cost. On 
se who have things to do there rests a responsibility which 
not on those who have no obligations as doers. If the 
bters were in the majority, there would, it is true, be no labor, 
no sacrifices, no anxiety and no burden raised or carried, no 
contribution from our ease and comfort to the welfare of others 
or even to the extension of our resources to the welfare of ourselves. 
There would be ease ; but, alas, there would be nothing 
done. 

fBut grave problems come in the life of a nation, however 
:h men may seek to avoid them. They come without our 
dng ; why, we do not know; but the generation on which 
y are forced cannot avoid the responsibility of honestly 
ving for their solution. And if that effort be made in conmce, 
in justice and honor it will not be in vain." 

Our martyred presidents, Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley! 
What an inspiration are their lives to every poor boy in this 
noble land of ours! Let every American boy revere their 
memories and emulate their examples ! Let every American 
boy know that "corruption wins not more than honesty." 
Let every American boy " be just and fear not." Let all his 
aims in life be for his country, his God and truth. Then if he 
fall, he falls "a blessed martyr!" Yours for better teaching of 
the rights and duties of citizenship, 

WILLIAM K. FOWLER, 

State Superintendent. 

From The Nebraska Teacher for September. 1001. 

INSTITUTES VISITED 

During the past month the deputy state superintendent visited 
the teachers' institutes in the counties of Antelope, Colfax, 
Howard, Kimball, Loup, Nance, Nemaha, Polk, Richardson 
and York. 

BREAKING CONTRACTS 

School board members do not possess as high an opinion of 
the ability and capacity of teachers in business matters as they 
should. Some teachers do not always show as much of these 
qualities as they should possess. In many parts of the state 
are rumblings (and grumblings) over the ease and nonchalance </seg>


            <seg id="p083">
71 

with which teachers are disposed to break contracts, even in 
the month of August, that they may accept other positions at 
an increase in salary of five dollars a month, or thereabouts, 
compelling boards to renew their search for teachers. It is 
true, boards may hold teachers to their contracts, or at least 
enjoin them from teaching elsewhere, but the board member 
usually says, "O, let them go! They would be dissatisfied if 
we kept them." And then after their departure they some 
times say, "Have teachers no appreciation of the courtesies 
or necessities of a business obligation?" And again, sometimes 
late in the season, school suprintendents are inclined to 
search out and entice away teachers that are under contract 
obligations elsewhere. Let us not forget the golden rule and 
professional courtesy in these matters. 

THE COMMON SCHOOL STUDIES 

Do not be over-ambitious in the desire to introduce into the 
rural schools high school studies. Teachers in some of the 
eastern counties of the state of Nebraska are teaching in the 
common schools the subjects of civil government, algebra, 
Latin, rhetoric, botany, physical geography and general history. 
Do not do it unless you have a school composed almost 
entirely of large pupils. Each district board is the judge of 
its own course of study, it is true, established by the consent 
and advice of the county superintendent, but it is the intent of 
the law and of the founders of our common school system that 
rural schools should be limited to the common school studies. 
The work of the rural school should stop with the eighth grade. 

Pupils who desire to go higher than that should make an 
extra effort to go to the village or town high school. It would 
profit the school district to pay such pupils' expenses nt such 
high school rather than have them instructed in the higher 
branches in the district school to the great disadvantage 
and detriment of the little folks there. There is a limit to 
the amount of work that a teacher can do well in a common 
school. 

EVENING EXERCISES IN SCHOOL HOUSES 

The rural school in sparsely settled districts, remote from 
towns and villages, is often the center of the social, religious, 
and civic life of the community. Church services and Sunday </seg>

            <seg id="p084">
72 


school are held in the school house ; the annual district meeting, 
and sometimes the township or precinct meetings are held 
there, and also entertainments of various kinds. In some 
parts of the state there is a tendency to lower the standard 
of the school entertainments. From dialogues, we pass to 
theatricals, and from theatricals to more or less questionable 
exercises. There is no reason, no excuse for such. All entertainments 
given in the schoolbouse, whether by the children 
or by their elders, should be maintained at as high a grade as 
possible, and anything of a questionable nature should be 
ruled out. With the vast amount of pure literature, beautiful 
poems, patriotic selections, and inspiring music now before the 
public, as well as clean, wholesome, instructive dialogues, 
there is no excuse for degenerating a public school entertainment 
into a minstrel show or cheap theatrical or vaudeville performance. 
An old-fashioned school exhibition might be given, 
with a spelling contest, a debate, and an exhibit of the written 
work and the drawing of the pupils, illustrating various lines 
of work. That would be worth while. 

LEAVING THE SCHOOLROOM 

There are children who have attended the public schools for 
several years who have seldom, if ever, asked to be excused 
from the schoolroom. There are others who leave the room 
each and every half day. Differently constituted, you say. 
Yes, undoubtedly, but not by nature. The difference is. in a 
measure at least, in habit, in training. We know of parents 
who require their children to attend to their physical necessities 
before they start for school, in the morning and at noon. 
Such parents realize that the ordinary outbuilding will, unavoidably, 
disease the body and corrupt the mind of the child. 
They realize that the gathering of large numbers of children 
in such places does not improve their morals or their manners. 
They realize, also, what is of minor importance, that a child 
who leaves the schoolroom each half day not only interrupts 
the work, attracts the attention of the teacher, and distracts 
the attention of the pupils, both in his exit and entrance, but 
also, if he loses ten minutes from his studies each time, loses 
sixty whole hours or more tban ten days in the course of nine 
months. A teacher should permit pupils to leave the school- </seg>


            <seg id="p085">
73 

room when necessary, and she should be cautioned noi to coostitute 
herself the judge of the child's physical necessities, tmt 
she should use all reasonable means to reduce the nomber to a 
minimum. One'teacher has adopted the plan of excusing d«r-ing 
the first five minutes after nine o'clock, while nettling down 
and hanging wraps, pupils who think they need to pass oat 
before recess, and strange as it may seem, this almost entirely 
cures the evil of a string of pupils constantly goi ng m4 eoari ag. 
Pupils will not neglect play to attend to their physical neeeaaities 
before school time, even with the Up of the bell ire 
minutes before the hour to remind them. And in tbiscoooection, 
is it too much to ask of parents that they i— trie t their 
children in habits of cleanliness: the fathers their boys, sad 
the mothers their girls?

SUGGESTIVE CIRCULARS 

This department has been particularly well pleased with 
thelarge number of ciraulars'that.have been issued this fall by 
the county superintendents. These are full of exceptionally 
helpful suggestions. The larger number are to teachers, a few 
to school district officers, and a '^limited number to patrons. 
The latter number might, "with profit, be increased. Make a 
liberal use of printers' ink. 

AMERICAN HISTORY, 1900-1901. 

This department will soon publish a brief history of the 
United States for the last two or three years to supplement the 
school histories in use in the state. The copy for this supplemental 
history material is "now being prepared by Prof. H. W. 
Caldwell, of the Department of American History and Jurisprudence 
in the University of Nebraska. It will comprise at 
least eight printed pages, and we hope to furnish with it excellent 
half-tone likenesses of our late lamented President McKinley 
and of President Roosevelt. It will be distributed in suffi 
cient quantities to furnish all United States history classes in 
the state, seventh, eighth, or ninth grades. 

FREE TEXT BOOKS 

The validity of the free text-book law of Ohio was passed 
upon by Judge Strimple of Cleveland recently in a decision 
wherein be reasons that the constitution of the United States 
makes it imperative on every state to establish a common 
school system, and the constitution of the state nowhere places 
any limitation upon the legislature in its duty to provide an 
efficient school system. Under the compulsory education law 
it is the duty of the state to provide everything needful for 
education. "There never was a legal obligation resting upon 
parent or guardian to buy school books. It was a moral obligation 
only. The state can not discharge its duty fully' by 
building schoolhouses alone, and there is no difference between 

furnishing a" blackboard or a chart and the furnishing of 

books." </seg>

THE WHEEL OF POLITICK 

The turn of the wheel of politics often drops oat of pebHe 
service many who by training and experience ba*« Ittaamn 
peculiarly well fitted to fulfill satisfactorily and soceptably to 
those immediately concerned the duties of tbeir ottes. The 
antipathy to a nomination for a third term on the part of mmmj 
politicians very often discharges from the public mrr'tcm Me 
most efficient servants. This has been demonstrated tola (all 
in many cases, and particularly in Lincoln county, wboaa 
superintendent, Miss Bertha Thoelecke, write* to toe state 
superintendent expressing her appreciation of seme words at 
commendation relative to her work and reports and bar regret 
at being unable to continue in the work. 8bs says 
further: "Although the hardships and privations, cxposTS 
and danger have been great, there is much more of regret 
than of relief in the prospect of a change." 

THE STATE SUPERINTEND* 

During the past month the state superintendent visited the 
state normal school at Spearfisb, South Dakota; the public 
schools of Dead wood and Lead, South Dakota; the Nebraska 
normal college at Wayne; the schools of Hyannis, Man, 
York, Wayne, Norfolk, and Scribner, in Nebraska, and maay 
rural schools in several counties in the stats. 

SPEAR FISH (S. D.) NORMAL 

The normal school at Spearfish is an excellent one, hsaatlfully 
located with magnificent Swiss scenery and fine troot 
fishing within a few miles, and it has a museum contaiaiaa; 
many thousand specimens, principally geological. With the 
exception of the president, the faculty is composed entirely 
of women, including two former Nebraakans, lira. Kate O. 
Scott and Miss Harriet L. Barber. The young women's hall 
or dormitory is a beautiful building of stone, wall furnished, 
steam heated, and electric lighted. The entire sarroandiaga 
are delightful. 

LEAD AND DEADWOOD 

The schools of Lead and Deadwood do not differ materially 
from those in Nebraska, except in environment. Both cities 
are overgrown mining camps with a mixed population, CbJa </seg>

            <seg id="p088">

ese children outnumbering the negroes, and Slavs particularly 
predominant in some of the schoolrooms in Lead. Mr. E. C. 
Grubbs, formerly of Wymore and Hartington, Nebraska, is 
superintendent at Lead. The lowest salary paid in either Lead 
or Deadwood is $65 a month, while high school assistants receive 
185, and the high school principal $ 100. Expenses for 
room and board are from $25 to $30 a month. They have ten 
months of school. Deadwood has a heavy high school course 
of four years, nearly all optional, including four years of Latin, 
three of German, and three of French. They have also a two 
years' commercial course. Deadwood has twenty teachers, 
Lead thirty-two. Children are not received in the schools 
under six years of age. 

WAYNE NORMAL 

The normal at Wayne, under the leadership of Pres. J. M. 
Pile, is a good and growing school, having nearly doubled its 
membership this fall. It is pleasantly situated on a hill north 
of the town, commanding a beautiful view of a most highly 
favored section of the state. 

THE YORK HIGH SCHOOL 

The high schools visited in Nebraska were invariably doing 
good work. In York the assembly room accommodates only 
the three higher grades, numbering possibly 120 pupils, and the 
ninth grade, numbering 65 or 70, is in a separate room under the 
charge of Miss Belle Reynolds. The York high school is a 
loyal, patriotic, earnest, progressive, "working" body of 
students. In appearance they are more mature than the average 
high school students. Perhaps there is less "forcing" in 
the grades in York. Space forbids mention of the other high 
schools at this time. 

CUSTER COUNTY 

The rural sod schoolhouses in Custer county are well built 
and comfortable, though neither well lighted nor well ventilated. 

OTHER COUNTIES 

In nearly all the rural schoolhouses visited, both sod and 
frame, in several counties, the evidences of the teacher's handiwork 
were abundant, in minor repairs, conveniences and decorations; 
but in grosser matters, the care of buildings and grounds, </seg>

the duty of the district board, evidences of neglect were sometimes 
apparent. Although the superintendent found many 
things to commend, only those which should be condemned 
will be mentioned : such as floors of rough, warped, six-inch 
boards; the scarcity of slate blackboards; old, noisy, battlescarred, 
rattle-trap desks ; a poor small desk for the teacher's 
use; grimy walls; unblacked stoves with rusty pipes ; broken up 
sidewalks and broken down outbuildings. In some schools 
these conditions do not prevail, but pretty wall paper forms the 
background for the teacher's Perry pictures. These pictures 
and others like them have replaced the old chromos and colored 
advertisements in many places, though interior views of one 
schoolhouse visited would form excellent advertising material 
for McCormick's Harvesters, Hood's Sarsaparilla, and Pear's 
Soap. In one rural school the program included five classes in 
arithmetic and one class in numbers; five reading classes and 
one chart class ; four classes in spelling ; four in geography ; 
three in history ; two in language and two in grammar ; two in 
physiology ; and one class each in writing, bookkeeping, civics, 
and algebra, with general exercises and singing, thirty-four 
classes in all. This number might and should be reduced to 
twenty-eight or less. In general, the seating of the rooms 
was poor and irregular, with no attention paid to the proper 
distances between the desks, extreme sizes in the same row 
and no perceptible relations between the size of the desk and 
the size of the pupil occupying it. Schoolhouse lamps are 
usually used by organizations other than the district school that 
meet in the evenings, but that is no excuse for having nasty 
lamps with dirtv, smoky chimneys in the schoolroom during 
the day. Throw them out or clean them up ! In too many 
rural schools the text-books are in very poor condition, though 
in nearly every school visited were two, three, or four good 
charts. Now, Jhese are all or nearly all matters that should be 
remedied by the board and patrons, but a wise and judicious 
teacher may Irresponsible for the initiative. Compare these 
conditions with many farm wives' kitchens, clean and neat and 
tidy as they are, with the buildings and grounds of irany farmers' 
homes, where comforts and conveniences are multiplying, 
where plate glass windows, cedar trees, and other evidences of 
prosperity and care and forethought attract the eye in driving </seg>

CONGRATULATIONS ON ELECTION 

My Dear Superintendent : I desire to congratulate your county 
on your election to the office of superintendent of her schools, 
and to assure you that the duties you will assume in January 
are great and the responsibilities grave and important. During 
the years 1902-1903 you will be held chiefly responsible (and 
justly so ) for the success or failure, the progress or retrogression, 
of the rural schools of your county. 

CALL ON US 

I hope you will feel free to call upon this department for 
any assistance it may be able to give, and I hope that our relations 
may be mutually pleasant, and profitable to the school 
interests generally of our great and beloved state. 

BY WAY OF PREPARATION 

By express prepaid I am pleased to send you a number of 
publications of this department for the current year, including 
tbool Laws, Special Day Programs, Circulars, Price Lists, 
., and the last Biennial Report of this department. Copies 
all these should be in every county superintendent's office, 
t this package is sent that you may acquire, before your inction 
into office, a greater knowledge of the law and its reirements, 
and of what may be expected of this department. 

K fishing for you and your schools a very pleasant and most 
Stable administration, I am. Yours very truly, 

WILLIAM K. FOWLER, 

State Superintendent. 

December 12, 1901. 

My Dear Sujierintendent : 

ORGANIZED DISTRICTS 

Each organized county not already divided into school districts, 
or any part of such counties not so divided, shall be 
divided by the county superintendent into as many school districts </seg>

            <seg id="p093">
79 


Ky be necessary.— Section 3, Subdivision I, School Laws 
braska for 1901. 

UNORGANIZED TERRITORY 

Nebraska has ninety (90) organized counties, including the 
entire state ; therefore, every section of land or fraction there 
of is under county organization. There are, however, thous 
ands of square miles of territory in the state not organized 
into school districts. And in this territory are hundreds 
perhaps thousands, of school children who are absolutel 
denied free school privileges ! And in the State of Nebraska 

TOO MANY DISTRICTS 

The cases are rare indeed where I would favor the organization 
of new districts. There are already too many weak 
districts in Nebraska. But let me urge upon you as a duty, 
which, in my opinion, is imperative, that you see to it that 
every Section, every acre, every foot of soil in your county is 
annexed to some existing district in a manner to promote the 
general school interests of your county in the highest possible 
degree. There is no territory too good to be exempt from 
the school district tax. Were it within the power of this office 
to solve this problem, it would be done before the New Year. 
But it rests with you. You are the court of original jurisdiction 
in such matters. Upon petitions signed by one-half of the 
legal voter* in the district affected and" in the territory proposed 
to be annexed, you can solve this problem. See Section 4, 
Subdivision I, School Laws of Nebraska for 1901. But yon 
should take the initiative. 

CONSOLIDATE 

Remember that the last legislature removed the six-mile 
limit in the of school districts. Section 4b, Subdivision 
V provides for transportation of pupils whenever 
the distance from school shall render it impracticable to attend 
without transportation. It will not be difficult to secure the 
necessary number of petitioners in the organized district, and 
if you deal only with the legal voters in the territory proposed 
to be annexed, you will be able to overcome most of the </seg>

            <seg id="p094">
80 


obstacles. Non-resident property owners have no voice 
and are not considered in passing upon petitions. 

How many square miles are there in your county? 
How many not organized into school districts? 

Kiat is your estimate of the school census in this territory 
ur county not organized into school districts? 

Of the unorganized school district territory in your county, 
how many square miles are there of government land? 

¦hope that a later report will show a material reduction in 
number of square miles of territory in your county not 
inized into school districts. 

December 16, 1901. 

My Dear Sup rintendent: 

SCHOOL CENSUS 

Btice that the state school census for 1901 is 1764 less than 
for 1900. If there is a decrease in your county, caution 
school directors about taking hereafter a complete and 
rate census for the benefit of their, own district. 

NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS 

Please notify me of any school district, village or city tha 
contemplates the erection of a school building during the yea 
1902, or that has one in process of construction, or has 
recently completed one. Kindly give me the name of th 
director or secretary, superintendent or principal or teacher 
and other information in your possession relative to th 
building.

names of the principals who do not send in reports. I have 
found so much trouble with some of them who do not report to me 
in the preparation of this association program. I have written' 
to some of them three and four times and still no report. In 
some instances I enclosed stamped and addressed envelopes

EDUCATIONAL DIRECTORY 

The Nebraska Educational Directory for the school year 1901-1902 
was received from the printer in November, and copies 
were distributed to school superintendents, principals and 
others interested as rapidly as other office duties would permit. 
The directory contains a complete and correct list of the 
county superintendents-elect on pages 3 and 4. Some of the 
new features of this year's edition are county superintendents' 
salaries, designation of county seats in list of graded schools, 
number of grades in each school, subdivision of school laws 
under which each graded school district is organized, map 
of the state with each county numbered, alphabetical list of 
counties with number of each (pages 3 and 4), an index to 
the map of the state with numbers from 1 to 90 and name of 
county as numbered (pages 41 and 42), and the number of 
county in which each city or village in the state is located ; 
with this number refer to page 41 or 42 for the name of the 
county and to the map for its location in the state. We hope 
these new features will be appreciated. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

GRADED SCHOOL REPORTS 

On November 7 this department mailed blanks for the graded 
school report to the present principals of the 117 graded 
schools in the state whose principals of year had failed to 
send in this report. Since that time fully one-half of this 
number have reported, some with apologies, some with the 
statement it is the second or even the third report they have 
sent us, and others have written in that their predecessors 
had failed absolutely to leave any information or statistics of 
the past school year. One principal called at this office to 
inform us in person that not a word or a figure, a report, 
statement, record, or register was in evidence, in his office, 
the secretary's, or the county superintendent's. Several 
principals confused this report with that containing information 
for the new educational directory.

BUTLER COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD ORGANIZATION 

Supt. Gene. Loomis of Butler county called a meeting 
December 11 of the school board members of his county to 
discuss ways and means of enforcing the compulsory attendance 
law. Sixty districts were represented by seventy-five 
school board members. The law was explained in detail, and 
nearly every director present agreed to "see to it" that the law 
was complied with in his district. This was the first school 
board meeting ever held in Butler county, and will undoubtedly 
be productive of much good. 

THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENCY 

A prominent school man in the state writes this department 
in part as follows: "As I view the public school system it 
Seems to me that the county superintendency is the weakest 
point. There are some first-class county superintendents. 
They all ought to be first-class men and women. The schools 
of the county ought to be as well superintended as the schools 
of any important city in the county ; but not many superintendents 
of important city schools would be willing to take 
the superintendency of the county in which they live. If in 
some way the appointment, the tenure of office and the salaries 
were more after the order of the city superintendency, </seg>

it might be that we would have more excellent county superintendents." 
I presume this schoolman has been reading the 
salaries in the new Nebraska educational directory. 

FOUR YEAR HIGH SCHOOLS 

Here is a four year high school course of study/for a 
village enrolling approximately sixty pupils in the high/school 
department and employing two teachers there. This department 
does not favor or endorse the establishment of a fouryear 
course of study for a village or city employing less than 
ten teachers, unless it be a county seat, or unless there are 
other exceptional circumstances; but we submit herewith an 
outline showing how village schools employing six or seven 
teachers accomplish the feat, by yearly alternation of subjects.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

January 6, 1902. 

My Dear Superintendent, or Principal: 

FOR THE WINTER TERM 

re fall term of the current school year has passed into his- 
While it has been to a degree pleasant and profitable to 
you and your school let the winter term be more so. You will 
have the largest enrollment of the year during the next three 
months. Endeavor to secure the best possible daily attendance. 
Take advantage of this opportunity to serve the 
larger proportion of your people to the best of your ability. 

THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 

«A more thorough study of English is imperative. If it be 
ue that "all the acquisitions of the human race, all sciences, 
and arts, and histories, and sentiments of humanity have 
passed into the English tongue," I may not be thought a 
dangerous agitator when I say I consider it a blunder of judgment 
to cling to that stubborn vanity in our system of education 
which pushes our young men and young women into 
Latin and Greek before they know anything of the "lofty 
thoughts and beautiful imagery of Longfellow;" before they 
have any knowledge of the "chaste humor and gentle satire 
of Holmes;" before they have any understanding of the "profound 
yet simple philosophy of Emerson;" before they have 
felt any interest in^the intense earnestness of Whittier ; before 
their minds have received any enlightenment and their taste 
any improvement from the "thorough, yet genial, scholarship of 
Lowell;" aye, before they are on speaking terms with that 
prince of dramatists, that chief of poets, William Shakespeare. 
"Once, it is true, the roll of human greatness read thus: 
Homer, Hesiod, Euripides, Pericles, Plato, Virgil, 
icero, Caesar, and the splendor of the catalogue none will have 
e rashness to deny ; but into the intellectual world came a 
&gt;nderful company of modern princes — a Newton equaling a 
ato, and a Shakespeare balancing all antiquity." 

- 

OR LATIN AND GREEK 

* It is a reckless use of time to have so many of our young 
men and young women staggering along in Latin, and sometimes^in 
Greek, 'when they cannot dispose of a simple sentence </seg>

in English ; hobbling along in the dark on Latin and Greek 
crutches, striving for two loays of stating one idea when they 
ought to be searching for two ideas and the power to express 
them in the native simplicity of their mother tongue. "The 
poor man, in the cold of mid-winter, does not need ten shovels 
with which to put one ton of coal into the scuttle, but what 
he craves is ten tons of coal and one good shovel. If the 
remark will not give any offense, it may be let fall here, that 
there are thousands of boys and girls, older and younger, whose 
ability to express thought has quite outgrown the thought 
they have on hand awaiting expression, and, having mastered 
a great many styles of saying things, they find themselves in 
the position of having nothing to say." 

ENGLISH ANALYSIS 

I The importance of grammatical analysis in the study of 
glish can hardly be over-stated. Prof. William D. Whity 
of Yale University, and editor-in-chief of the Century Dicnary, 
says: "Give me a man who can, with full intelligence, 
ce to pieces an English sentence, brief and not too compliied, 
even, and I will welcome him as better prepared for 
•ther study in other languages than if he had read both 
ssar and Virgil, and could parse them in the routine style 
which they are often parsed. ' ' 

MCKINLEY MEMORIAL 

I desire to call especial attention to the suggestion for a 
collection of contributions from the children in the public 
schools of this state to the McKinley Memorial Fund which is 
to be devoted to the erection of a monument to William McKinley 
at Canton, Ohio. To a Nebraska boy, James Albert Sherman 
Edwards of Fremont, belongs the honor of being the first 
to suggest a plan to bring every child attending the schools in 
the United States into close touch with the effort to raise a 
monument to the memory of our late president. The Hon. 
Ryerson Ritchie, secretary of the McKinley Memorial Association, 
in a letter to the Hon. E. Rosewater, secretary and 
treasurer of the McKinley Memorial Fund for Nebraska, sets 
forth some very practical suggestions as to the manner of 
taking these contributions : </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Sir : Senator Fairbanks has referred to me your letter to 
him of December 1, with a copy of a letter from a lad at Fremont, 
Neb., suggesting 1-cent subscriptions from the school 
children of the United States. While the suggestion made by 
Master Edwards is an excellent one, it is very difficult to carry 
out, and the contribution of 1-cent is not much of a sacrifice 
for the purpose such as the erection of a tomb at the grave of 
our late president. Of couree, the contribution of 1-cent would 
be a liberal offering from children of Door parentage and would 
be as gladly accepted as $1 from children of wealthy people. 
Nevertheless, the expense involved in bringing about organisation 
of the school children among 75,000,000 of people is such 
that the result would not probably warrant the expense. 
A 5-cent subscription has been started in several of thestates 
and even that is burdensome to handle. A better suggestion 
has been made by Mrs. Buchanan of Washington to President 
Roosevelt. It is that each class in the several schools through 
out the entire country make its contribution in such a way 
that credit will be given the class and no distinction be made. 

Superintendent Jones of this city has adopted a plan which 
is very good, that of giving to each boy and girl an envelope 
upon which they are to write their name and address and 
enclose their contributions, whether 1 cent or $1. This 
method avoids the humiliation of the poorer children and 
makes the contribution very expressive of the interest of the 
school children. 

The reports submitted to the trustees from all sections of 
the country were indeed very gratifying. Your interest in 
this work in your city and state is highly appreciated. We 
are doing our best to assist the work of the several local and 
state auxiliary committees throughout the country, and if I 
can be of any service to you do not hesitate to call upon me. 

Respectfully yours, 

Ryerson Ritchie, 

Secretary. 

This cause has my hearty endorsement. All collections 
should be transmitted directly to the Hon. E. Rosewater, 
Omaha, secretary and treasurer of the McKinley Memorial 
Fund for Nebraska. It is urged that these contributions be 
taken not later than January 29, 1902. It seems to me that 
this date, the fifty-ninth anniversary of the birth of our late 
president, would be a fitting time for concerted action 
among the schools of our state for the purpose of aiding this 
movement </seg>

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES. 

Attention is called to the national meeting of the Department 
of Superintendence at Chicago, February 25, 26, 27, 1902. 
We ought to have at least one hundred school superintendents 
from Nebraska at this meeting. The N. E. A. will hold its 
forty-first annual convention at Minneapolis, July 7-11, 1902. 
Let us make "On to Minneapolis one thousand strong" Neoraska's 
battle cry for the N. E. A . 

January 9, 1902. 

My Dear County Superintendent: 

Congratulations on your induction into office! Success to 
your administration and the schools of your county ! 

SUGGESTIONS 

I think it well to put into type- written mimeograph form, at 
r, some of the apparent conclusions that may be drawn 
the trend of the discussions at the sessions of the county 
superintendents of Nebraska held last week, together with 
some other ideas and suggestions. 

¦Keep a note book. Begin to make notes of items for your 
nual circulai letter to directors and other school board offirs. 


See that every one of vour teachers is supplied with a copy 
of Special Day Programs and one of School Law for Teachers. 

School district treasurers must file a bond with the county 
clerk, and when re-elected they must tile a new bond. 

Sixty-five county superintendents whose terms begin today, 
and sixteen others who today step out of the office, were in 
Kmdance at the State Teachers' Association. A splendid 
wing! 

This department will be pleased to inform county superintendents 
of available institute talent, including conductors, 
instructors and lecturers, and to render any other assistance 
in its power for the success of the institute. 

The tendency in schoolroom decoration is toward a multiplicity 
of small pictures and a bewildering display of small 
articles. This should be counteracted. Three or four large 
pictures, carefully selected, are better for wall display than 
150 one-cent Perry pictures. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Delve into the records, reports and supplies in your office. 
Clear up and clean out old stock and obsolete matter. Find 
out the Reading Circle situation in your county ; the adoption 
of the Course of Study ; the text books used ; the situation in 
general and in detail. 

Paring the business sessions of the county superintendents 
te was taken on the proposition of the consolidation of 
ol districts and the transportation of pupils at public 
snse, which showed that forty-two of those present favored 
none opposed the idea. 

COUNTY ORGANIZATION AND UNIT 

A large majority of the county superintendents of Nebraska 
favor county organization of school boards and adoption of 
rules, regulations and course of study, and the enforcement of 
the compulsory attendance for children between seven 
and fourteen years of age. A few favor county adoption and 
uniformity of text books. 

NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS 

Euring the school year 1900-1901 the number of school dists 
in the state was reduced from 6708 to 6674. The greatchanges 
were in Boyd county from 77 to 68, in Brown 
ntyfrom 50 to 41, in Dawes county from 99 to 92, in Perkins 
nty from 76 to 70, and in Sheridan county from 121 to 105. 
the good work go on ! 

N. E. A. DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE 

The Department of Superintendence of the N. E. A. will 
meet in Chicago, February 25, 26 and 27. Topics for discussion 
include The County Institute from a Practical Standpoint, 
The Real Value of Examinations as Determining the Teacher's 
Fitness for Work, Tenure of Office, The Rural School Problem 
of Consolidation as Affecting Attendance and the Establishment 
of Libraries, Agricultural Instruction in the Common 
School, etc. Supt. E. J. Bodwell of Douglas county usually 
attends, but he should have company from among the county 
superintendents. Thirty or forty of the city superintendents 
of Nebraska will attend this meeting: Several of the county 
superintendents should accompany them. Hon. Henry Sabi </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

f cDru«r\ Xj \\flj£. 

My Dear Superintendent, or Principal: 

CIGARETTES 

I am in receipt of so many requests for a full text of my 
opinion and recommendations to the school boards of the state 
on measures to prohibit the sale of cigarettes to minors that I 
deem it advisable to send out the same in this form : 

The board of education has the authority to prohibit the use 
of cigarettes and tobacco in any form in or about the school 
buildings, on the school grounds, and on the way to and 
from school. But after pupils arrive home at the close of the 
school day, and until they leave home for school the morning 
tthe next school day the school board has no jurisdiction in 
matter unless the extreme use of cigarettes or tobacco unfits 
such pupils for school work ; then they might be expelled 
as a common nuisance. 

But there is a way by which pupils may be prohibited from 
using tobacco and cigarettes when they are beyond the jurisdiction 
of the board of education : enforce the law which prohibits 
the sale of tobacco or cigarettes to minors. Under this 
law "No person in this state shall sell, givr or furnish any cigarette 
or cigarettes, or tobacco in any of its forms, to any minor under 
fifteen years of age; that if any person or persons in this state 
shall violate the provisions of this act, he, she, or they shall, 
on conviction,forfeit and pay for each and every such offense 
the sum of twenty-five dollars." 

The foregoing applies to tobacco in any of its forms. 

Now, with reference to the disposal of cigarettes or cigarette 
paper, we have a more stringent law, as follows : 

KThat hereafter no person or persons in this state shall sell, 
3 away, or furnish any cigarettes or cigarette paper in any 
n whatever to any minor under the age of twenty one. 

"If any person or persons shall violate the provisions of 
this act, he or they shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor 
and subject to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars, and 
not to exceed two hundred dollars, and costs of prosecution. 

"That any Justice of the Peace of the county where such 
sale takes place shall have jurisdiction of such offense. 

"That if any person or persons, after conviction under this 
act, shall fail or neglect to immediately satisfy the judgment </seg>

Pits rendered by such Justice of the Peace, the said Justvll 
immediately issue a mittimus to any Sheriff or 
ble of such county, commanding him to arrest soch perpersons 
and convey him or them to the common jail of 
d county, there to remain until the fine and costs are 
otherwise discharged according to law." 

rhe foregoing extracts are sections 245q to MS r.'i, chapter 
Compiled Statutes of Nebrsaka, 1901, Criminal Code. 

At the suggestion of this department, the school board at 
Arlington, Washington County, printed the above ¦¦ctto— 
of law on heavy manila cardboard, 11x16 inches, and posted 
them in public places in the village of Arlington, with the 
following notice beneath : "The School Board of Arlington, 
Washington County, Nebraska, has caused the above noetic— 
of law published for the protection of the school children of 
said district. The School Board will see that the law ia enforced." 
This notice was signed by the six members of the 
Arlington Board of Education. I have already mailed a copy 
of this notice to every high school and village principal in 
the state, to every.county and city superintendent, and to the 
secretaries of the boards of education in the cities of the state. 
I am pleased to say that many school boards have acted favorably 
upon the suggestion. The Lincoln Board of Education 
printed the law on card board and posted notices in various 
places in the city, with the following statement: "The truant 
officer, acting under the direction of the board of education, 
will see that the above laws are enforced." Signed, George 
A. Adams, President Board of Education ; A. J. Morris, Sec- 

I have heard from several other boards of education throughout 
the state who are also awakening to the danger of the 
cigarette and to the insidious inroads it is making upon good 
school work. The law is a good one. All that is necessary 
is a sufficient amount of moral backbone to enforce it thoroughly 
in every school district. The press of the state are 
quite unanimous in the support of the law, and the pulpit, the 
Sunday school, the W. C. T. U. and the women's clubs are all 
nobly assisting. 

rie boy who is an habitual user of the cigarette is usually 
of the poorest students in his class, if not the poorest one. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

It usually takes him nearly two years to do one year's work 
well. This assertion is backed by the testimony of twenty-five 
principals in the schools of Chicago and by the experience of 
nearly every school man and woman in this state. 

Mr. J. H. Humpe, manager of the Lincoln Street Railway 
Company, says that for several years his'company^has refused 
to hire a user of the cigarette. He declares that the cigarette 
victim is entirely unworthy of confidence ; that he has little 
interest in the business of his employer ; and that they have no 
use for him in their business. Many great business corporations 
throughout the country are now barring from their 
employment the cigarette fiend. 

Mr. James Rivett, a superintendent in the employ of the 
Burlington railroad, said to a friend a few days ago : ' Today 
fifteen young men appeared in my office seeking employment. 
I engaged five. The other ten do not know why I did 
not hire them, but it was simply because they were cigarette 
smokers. That was enough for me. I had no use and no 
place for any of them." As a business proposition, therefore, 
every boy and every young man should abstain from'the use 
of cigarettes. 

~ According to the United States Tobacco Journal, the production 
of cigars for the year 1900 was an increase of 13 per cent 
over the preceding year, which indicates of course an increased 
consumption. The domestic production of tobacco in its various 
forms, including 8,500 tons of snuff, was 160,000 tons. I 
state it in this form because the figures given in pounds seem 
almost incredible: 320,000,000. 

Eie following figures in regard to the manufacture of cigars 
cigarettes may be of some interest to you. They are taken 
l the annual report of the Commissioner of Internal R«v-i 
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1901, page 34.

years man will be both bald and toothless from the cradle to

BI hope you will not permit the cigarette habit to interfere 
iously with good school work in your schools. 

It is perhaps uunecessary to again call your attention to 
section 5a, subdivision *IX of the School Laws of State, 
which provides that the pupils in all schools supported by 
public money or under state control shall be instructed in 
physiology and hygiene, with special reference to the effects 
of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon 
the human system ; and to section 6 of the same subdivision, 
which says that no certificate shall be granted to any person to 
teach in the public schools of the state who has not passed a 
satisfactory examination in these subjects. A satisfactory 
teacher's examination would necessarily include an inquiry 
as to the applicant's ability to present the subjects to the child 
in an intelligent and intelligible manner. It is a noteworthy 
fact that this instruction in physiology and hygiene and the 
effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics, is 
the only instruction required in the schools of the state either 
by the Constitution or Legislative Enactment.

PRINCIPALS' SALARIES 

Iuring the state teachers' association some of the representes 
of the school book publishing houses were besieged 
ost hourly by school superintendents and principals for 
k, either for the summer or permanently ; and this is not 
nge when we consider that a large majority of the married 
i in the profession do not receive as large a salary for teachschool 
as many more or less skilled workmen. Run down 
list of salaries in the educational directory, and you will find 
ly teaching for $540, $585, $630, and $675 a year. Compare 
se wages with what a carpenter may earn.

the reason that their board of education raises the salaries 
when the members think their teachers deserve it, without 
waiting upon requests and without notification to principal and 
others. They pay their high school assistant and their first 
primary teacher each $55 a month ; the others $50 each. They 
did not reduce their salaries during the hard times. They pay 
for what they get, and they get what they pay for. 

WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS 

At the request of Howard J. Rogers, Chief of Department 
of Education of the World's Fair to be held in St Louis next 
year, the state superintendent has made formal application 
for space for Nebraska's educational exhibit. Word comes 
back that this will include the exhibits of the state university 
and state normal school. It will also include such private 
schools as desire to exhibit and it is thought best to include. 
Mr. Rogers does not yet know whether exhibits of the state 
industrial institutions will be included with the educational 
exhibit or come under the head of charities and corrections 
in the social economy exhibit. The state superintendent asked 
for 10,000 square feet of floor space. Mr. Rogers says the 
amount will probably be less, but they shall endeavor to 
make it amply sufficient for our needs.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

COST OF EDUCATION 



The cost of education per pupil in the state for the school 
year 1899-1900, based on average daily attendance, was *$21.70 
for all schools. For the graded schools alone, upon an average 
of 178 days, it was $22.94. For the rural districts, upon an 
average of 147 days, it was $18.31. This is less than thirteen 
cents per pupil per day in graded schools, and "more thau 
twelve cents per pupil per day in the rural schools. Take 
away from the graded schools the cities of Omaha, Lincoln, 
and South Omaha, and the cost per pupil in the rural schools 
of the state would exceed that in the graded schools. Take away 
from the graded schools the high schools in Omaha and in 
cities of the first class, and the cost per pupil per day in the 
rural schools of Nebraska would be far in excess of that in the 
graded schools. In Blair the cost per pupil per day was less 
than ten cents. We would be pleased to receive statistics on 
similar comparisons for the last school year from some of the 
county superintendents. 

SCHOOL BOARD ORGANIZATIONS 

The school laws of Nebraska give the school boards of a 
county the right to adopt a course of study with the consent 
and advice of the county superintendent, and they also make 
it the duty of district board, or of a representative, to 
attend all meetings called by county superintendent for 
the purpose of adopting or revising the course of study and 
making necessary rules and regulations. We hope the county 
superintendents of the state will organize their school boards 
as soon as possible under the provisions of this law. In one 
county the boards have organized with monthly meetings held 
in different parts of the county on different Saturdays of the 
month, and they have elected one truant officer to serve all the 
school districts in the"county under the compulsory attendance 
law. In other counties^text-books have'been'selected, and but 
two or three books in each branch have been named. For 
instance, in geography, the selections were Natural, Frye, and 
Swinton, Swinton fbeing "placed in the list because a majority 
of the rural schools now use that text, and changes may be 
made gradually at the close of the term or when the books are 
badly worn, for one of the other more highly favored texts. </seg>

            <seg id="p117">
OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES. 

99 

The advisability of uniformity of text-books for a county may 
be an open question, but there is no doubt that if uniformity is 
a good thing, progress toward it should be gradual, and that 
districts should be allowed a year or two to exchange the books 
now in use to the ones adopted or recommended by the association 
of school boards or its committee. 

TEACHING IN CITY AND COUNTRY 

This is winter. Some teachers in Nebraska get up in the 
morning in a steam-heated bedroom, breakfast in a warm dining 
room, ride to school in a stove-heated street car, teach in a 
steam-heated schoolroom warmed to 70 degrees Fahrenheit 
before their arrival, instruct their two grades jluring the day, 
and leave the room in the afternoon in time to permit the janitor 
to sweep before dark ; the evening they may devote to 
ohurch, social, musical or literary matters in a comfortable 
way. Other teachers in the state creep out at daylight from 
between comforts frosted at the edges, stand on ice-cold matting 
while they break the ice in the pitcher, and then creep to 
the cob fire in the kitchen stove to warm their benumbed fingers 
and feet; they may eat in the kitchen, if it is very cold, if 
not, in the half-warmed dining room adjacent, and then they 
tramp a mile or so along the country road or through the cornfield, 
gathering a "shuck" or two to start a roaring fire in the 
cannon ba|l stove with the aid of the newspapers from yesterday's 
lunch and a few "cottonwood shavings"; around the fire 
the teacher and pupils revolve and also rotate on their axes 
that they may not freeze on one side while they roast on the 
other; after the thirty-second period or recitation for the day, 
the teacher sweeps out and plunges homeward through the 
snow to spend a longjwinter evening in the farmhouse. Fairy 
tale and fiction ? No. We have been in both places, and in 
the latter place we received about one-half or one-third the 
salary that we did in the ' former. But do not be discouraged 
if you are still in the rural school ! You are doing a great 
work, and it is a great disciplinary school — for you ! How 
improve conditions? We hardly know. But study consolidation, 
centralization, transportation. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

IM ARCH ~ i&gt; lyUwi. 

My Dear Superintendent 

HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN COUNTY SEATS 

There are twenty counties in Nebraska without a High School 
district. While in two or three of these counties. Chase, for 
example, a High School district could now be organized at the 
county seat in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of 
Subdivision VI of the School Laws of Nebraska for 1901, the 
other counties are without a district containing the required 
number of pupils,— more than 150 children between the ages 
of five and twenty -one years, — to organize as a high school district. 
A county without a high school district cannot establish 
the adjunct district of said county, and thus free high school 
privileges are denied all children resident in said county. I 
would urge, therefore, that in every county with a district at the 
county seat which contains, according to the last school census 
or the census of 1902, more than 150 children between the ages 
of five and twenty -one years (children temporarily absent from 
the district and married persons under twenty-one years of age 
should be included), that such county seat district organize at 
the annual meeting as a high school district, under the provisions 
of Section 1 of Subdivision VI, with a board of six members 
; on the same date in the annual meeting the rural (common) 
school districts of that county may vote on the etablishment 
of the adjunct district. 

CONSOLIDATE FOR THIS 

In counties where the county seat (or any other important 
village) district contains less than 150 children between the 
ages of five and twenty-one years, the districts around the 
county seat should consolidate (See Consolidation, ' 'Official 
Decisions," pp. 26-28 inc.) with it until the consolidated district

HOLDERS OF PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATES 

This department has published a list of all persons who have 
been granted professional (life) state certificates under the 
laws of Nebraska from May, 1881, to March 1, 1902. Copies 
of the list will be furnished on request. The state superintendent 
will be pleased to receive notice of changes and corrections 
in the list before the publication of his biennial report, as that 
document will contain a revised list. 

ARITHMETIC VS. SINGING 

One's position in his advocacy of a principle, a measure, an 
improvement or a change, as stated in a public address of an 
hour or forty-five minutes, is frequently misunderstood when 
shorn of all its illustrations and modifications and reduced to a 
dozen lines of cold newspaper type. I am in favor of daily 
lessons in mental arithmetic in every schoolroom in the state, 
excepting only the kindergarten and first primary rooms. I 
believe in more thorough drill in the fundamental processes in 
arithmetic, with a view to^greater accuracy and higher speed, but 
I question the advisability of eighteen-year-old schooloia'ams 
whose business experiences have been limited to the purchase 
of a personal wardrobe, some books, and the payment of a 
teacher's certificate fee, instructing eleven and twelve year old 
girls in taxes, stocks, bonds, insurance, partial payments, true </seg>

and bank discount, foreign and domestic exchange, etc. (Now if 
yon object to this statement I will think it is because you are 
older than eighteen, through age or experience!) Tn many 
schools the pupils are required to spend one hour or more a day 
on arithmetic in the schoolroom, and another hour at home in 
the evening, solving intricate problems and special applications, 
and no attempt is made to teach the rudiments of music, and a 
very few minutes only is spent in "singing. " Sometimes they 
are taught to sing by rote, parrot-like, and they sing the words 
as accurately as the small boy who was taught Drake's The 
American Flag in a concert recitation, and repeated the first 
four lines to his mother as follows: 

"When Freedom from her mountain tight 

Uncurled the dander from her hair, 

She wore her bathrobe all the night 

And et the starch in glory there." 

Iow I believe that all girls and most boys should be taught 
ing. Women were foreordained for wifehood and mother - 
d, according to my doctrine, and a woman with a baby in 
is is always a pleasing sight. But how helpless such a 
her is if she cannot sing, even though she be a lightning 
:ulator. Yes, I believe in music in the school room even 
ugh it be at the expense of some of the applications in 
her arithmetic.

RURAL SCHOOL PROBLEMS 

Isventy per cent of our teachers are employed in the country 
iols. Twenty of our counties are without a high school 
"ict. These counties are the farthest removed from the 
3 normal school. Graduates of the state university, the 
sges, academies, and the larger and better high schools, 
i rare exceptions, shun the rural school. Query No. 1 : 
r shall we improve the instruction in these rural schools? 
assessed valuation of hundreds of school districts in 
raska is less than §8,000. The limit of school district 
tion is 25 mills on the dollar of assessed valuation. Query 
2: How will such a district conduct a good school for six 
ths in the year on "$200 or less?

the counties of Frontier, Gosper, Harlan, and Phelps ; the Culbertson 
institute includes the counties of Chase, Frontier.Hayes, 
Hitchcock, and Red Willow; the Sidney institute includes the 
counties of Banner , Cheyenne, Kimball, and Scotts Bluff; and 
the Hyannis institute includes the counties of Grant, McPherson, 
and Thomas. Some additions may be made later to these 
lists. Teachers of Frontier county may attend at Holdrege or 
Culbertson. The institutes will be in session five weeks, June 
2 to July 4, including Saturdays, thus making the equivalent 
of a six weeks' term. Some of the features of these union 
institutes are : a large, enthusiastic attendance of teachers ; a 
strong corps of instructors; an excellent lecture course; a 
model school ; reduced expenses and small tuition fee. 

INSTITUTE ANNOUNCEMENTS 

Inother institute season is almost upon us. For several 
iths county superintendents have been making arrangements 
this annual event, corresponding with instructors and lecsrs 
relative to their availability and terms, and considering 
;r details of plans for the annual convocation of the teachers 
heir respective counties. More recently the teachers have 
i talking over their plans for the long summer vacation, 
in many cases postponing the final settlement and the 
jls thereof until the appearance of their superintendent's 
ouncement of the county institute. It]Jbehooves the county 
srintendent to complete arrangements and make announceits 
as soon as possible, that teachers and others concerned 
r complete their own personal plans. 

INSTITUTE INSTRUCTORS AND ARRANGEMENTS 

I he annual teachers' institute is a most important factor in 
progress and success of the rural and village schools of the 
nty. The successor failure of one week's work in a county 
iitute may measure, to a large degree, the success or failure 
the work in one hundred school rooms during twenty-four 
hirty-six weeks of the following school year. Superintends 
cannot exercise too great care and forethought in selectinstructors 
and determining plans. They may deliberate 
long, for an early announcement will add to the success of 
institute. Teachers should perfect their plan with the </seg>

determination to spend full time at their county institute when 
ever it may be held, to receive the inspiration that will come 
from the instruction of those with a larger knowledge and a 
greater experience than themselves and the enthusiasm that 
arises through contact with others in the same profession 
The perfection of the arrangement in detail for a teachers' 
institute must and should be determined by the county superintendent 
thereof. No outsider can give specific advice that will 
be of any great value. 

teacher's tenure of position 

(Visits during the late fall months to manv rural schools in 
ur or five counties in different parts of the state, and to a 
imber of city and village schools in those and other counties, 
nply confirmed us in the belief that the greatest barrier to 
bstantial and permanent improvement in the schools of 
jbraska is short tenure of position on the part of the tea* •! 
.rticularly in the rural schools. A majority of the rural 
hool teachers visited said that this was their first term in

during the winter term, they preferring not to teach during 
severe weather, and that they would resume again in th*«

UNION NORMAL INSTITUTES 

In my opinion the union normal institutes have come to stay. 

The advantages are great — including a larger attendance and 
more enthusiastic teachers, a stronger corps of instructors, 
excellent lecture courses, model schools, reduced expenses, 
including' railroad rates, and a smaller tuition for a term of 
four 'to six weeks. I believe that union normal institutes can 
and should be organized at many of the following places : 
Ashland, Fremont, Emerson or Wakefield, Plainview, Norfolk, 
Long Pine, Crawford, Sidney, North Platte, McCook, Holdrege, 
Hastings, St. Paul, and perhaps two or) three other "points in 
the state. "'County superintendents who desire to unite with 
other counties next year should notify this department during 
the fall that arrangements may be completed and the best 
conductors and instructors in the state selected before the meeting 
of the State Teachers' Association. 

From The Nebraska Teacher (or September, 1802 

PRIMARY INSTRUCTORS 

Ethe beginning of the institute season there appeared to 
scarcity of first-class primary institute instructors, but 
nber of primary teachers in the state have demonstrated 
fitness for institute work. 

EARLY ANNUAL REPORTS 

Eugust 23, thirty-one county superintendents had sent in 
r annual reports. Supt. A. L. Cook, of Washington county, 
Supt. C. W. Crum, of Madison county, sent their reports 
last days of July. It is hoped that few will be lacking 
tember 1. 

WANTED: THE BEST 

Ehe voters of a school district in Custer county levied fifty 
s at the annual meeting, and were grieved to learn from 
county superintendent that any excess over twenty-five 
s was illegal. They wanted all the school and the "best" 
:her they could have, and were willing to pay for them.

There are common schools for ordinary acadearic instruction 
in the common branches. 

A "CHEAP'' Stl'KKINTEWDKirr 

On my travels last month I heard of a board of edecsllcej 
that selected a superintendent from the field of applicants, aad 
then finding that in his "written application be asked fl flees 
dollars a month less than they expected to pay, iwedieteiy 
decided that he must be a "cheaper" man than they ware 
looking for. They then selected a man who placed a higher 
value upon his services. 

SCHOOL DISTRICT MAPS 

County superintendents might with profit take a wrhifffl dietrict 
map of their county, a map showing the lumber of auctions 
and the number of districts, and write in under eadl 
district number the number of mills levied for the sehool year 
1902-1903, the number of months of school voted at the anneal 
meeting, and the monthly salary paid the teacher. Then when 
the question of the division "of a district arose, they woeM 
have an object lesson and several arguments against division. 

A COUNTY OF ONE DISTKH T 

Iiere are several counties in Nebraska, each of which aright 
advantage be organized into a single school district, with 
ard of six, the necessary number of achoolho— ss properly 
¦ibuted, etc. This would solve many vexing prnblwsjs, 
ide the same number of months of school everywhere, profree

Is in the county, provide sufficient revenne within Ike) 
imum levy allowed under the law, do away with the dfrvl 
of old districts and the formation of new onea, ¦tioheh 
sfers. etc. 

FOR LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICTS 

ISly attention was recently attracted to a school district nap 
the county in the office of the superintendent of schools 
Hamilton county. The map gave the number of districts 
isisting of four, six, eight or nine sections of land. I asked </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Superintendent Woodard to prepare a table of each class or 
size of district, giving the average number of mills levied, 
the average number of months of school, and the average 
monthly salary paid to teachers, for districts composed of 
four, six, eight and nine sections respectively. He did so, 
and I submit herewith the table. Is it not a strong argument 
in favor of larger school districts? 

IDEAL RURAL SCHOOL PROGRAM 

Superintendent Barber of Boone county and Superintendent 
Bishop of York county, one a hustler and the other a rustler, 
and it doesn't matter which is which, have prepared for their 
schools an ideal daily program and had it printed on white 
cardboard about two by three feet in size. This department 
secured from the Bishop of York one hundred copies of his 
program, which we have taken pleasure in mailing to all 
county superintendents in the state. We hope they will study 
it, adapt it to the needs and demands of the schools of their 
respective counties, and reproduce it. A program like this 
should be studied "vertically and horizontally." Notice the 
headings first. Then run down the columns at the left, 
noting the division of time. Study the work of each grade 
or class, separately, as outlined from nine o'clock until four. 
Notice the apportionment of time for study and for recitation 
of each class. Then study the program horizontally, noting 
carefully what each grade or class is doing during each 
period. The vertical study of the program is from the standpoint 
of each class and each pupil ; the horizontal study is more 
from the standpoint of your own work and the school as a 
whole. These suggestions may be applied to any school program

My Dear Superintendent, or Principal: 

GREETINGS 

At this time, the beginning of another school year, I rt— lr» 
to extend to you the heartiest greetings of this department and 
our best wishes for the success of the schools under your so parvision. 
May substantial progress mark the year's work from 
month to month. I hope the following suggestions may prove 
of some value : 

ASSOCIATION OF SUPERINTENDENTS AND PRINCIPALS 

We hope to meet many of you in Lincoln during the Superintendents 
and Principals' section meeting, October 16, 17, 18. 
A splendid program is being prepared. See the August issue 
of The Nebraska Teacher. A rare treat is in store for all who 
attend. This meeting means more to city superintendents 
and principals than even the State Teachers' Association. 
You cannot afford to miss it. 

SCHOOL LIBRARIES 

i\re you provided with copies of the list of books for school 
raries recommended by the Nebraska Public Library Comssion 
and endorsed by the Reading Circle Board of the 
braska State Teachers' Association, and also with the lists 
five and ten dollar libraries? If not, apply to your county 
perintendent or write to this office. 

SCHOOL ORGANIZATION 

School boards with three members are organised under snbdivision 
III of the school laws. Boards with six members in 
districts where the annual meeting is held in June are organized 
under subdivision VI, and boards with six or nine members 
elected at the municipal election in April are organised 
under subdivision XIV. 

SEVENTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT 

Eie biennial report of this department will be issued Janr 
1, next. Much of the copy for it is now ready for the 
ters and will be sent to them immediately. Other copy 
be forwarded as prepared. "School Buildings and </seg>

of this report. We hope you will loan us again the cuts of 
school buildings used in the former publication for use in this 
report, and that many other cuts and photographs will be sent 
in for the same purpose. Photographs should be forwarded to 
as before October 15 to insure their use. 

SUPPLIES 

The supply of School Laws for 1901 is exhausted. If you 
desire a copy apply to your county superintendent. He can 
also furnish you with the Attendance Register and Term Summary 
and all other blank books needed. This office has still 
on hand a few hundred copies of the Teacher's Report Book 
for use in Nebraska Graded Schools which was prepared by 
ex-Supt. Corbett. We shall be pleased to furnish them on 
application as long as the supply lasts. We shall also be 
pleased to supply you liberally with copies of the American 
History (January 1, 1900 — December 31, 1901) pamphlet compiled 
by Prof. H. W. Caldwell and published by this depart- 

READING CIRCLE WORK 

I ["he work of the Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle is, as 
l know, voluntary, but there should be teachers' reading 
cles in a majority of the counties of the state. Interest 
1 activity in reading circle work depend largely upon the 
jouragement from the superintendent or principal. If he 
nifests interest and enthusiasm in professional study his 
«hers are guided by his example. This is a valuable auxiry 
in securing better work in your schools which we know 
a will appreciate. You and your teachers cannot afford to 
ss this opportunity of spending at least one hour a week 
the study and discussion of Hodge's Nature Study and Life 
d one or more of the six other books recommended by the 
lading Circle Board. For circulars of the Reading Circle 
irk and outlines of the various books apply to your county 
perintendent. 

COOPERATION OP HOME AND SCHOOL 

Let us urge upon pupils the necessity of denying themselves 
the pleasure of social diversions during the school week, and </seg>

of making Friday evening the time for fun and recreation. Bat 
the home must co-operate with the school in this plan if good 
results are to ensue. We often hear parents complaining 
against so much "party-going and party-giving" among oar 
young people. Yet if parents fail to aid in a proper control 
of these amusements, "the bad health and wasted energy and 
poor work due to party-going must remain without remedy." 

REVIEW THE COMMON BRANCH KS 

The benefit to pupils of a thorough review of the mftra 
branches during their higher course cannot be too strongly 
emphasized. Especially is this true of reading, spelling, letterwriting, 
arithmetic, geography of the United States and bar 
possessions, United States history, English grammar and 
composition. 

The subject of letter-writing is the most generally practiced, 
and, practically considered, the most important of all kinds of 
composition. It is indispensable in business. To be able to 
write a good letter is greatly to a person's advantage in any 
occupation. Many excellent situations are obtained by teachers, 
clerks, and others, on account of this ability : and quite as 
many are lost through the want of it. </seg>

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES. 

The adjunct district of county would include All 
the common school districts organized under Subdivision III, 
with a board of three members; this would be a tingle independent 
district, in no way affecting or interfering with the 
work or organization of each individual district. The adjoaet 
district would be organized solely that a tax of not to exceed 
two mills on the dollar of assessed valuation might be legally 
levied and collected, for the purpose of paying the tuition of 
the graduates of the rural or common schools at the nearest 
approved high school in the county. The adjunct district has 
no officers ; it builds no schoolhouses ; it votes no bonds. 

The law also provides for the recognition or approval of 
properly equipped high schools by the state superintendent, 
for a vote by their boards on the opening of their high school 
to non-residents without charge to them, for determining th«» 
cost of tuition, etc. 

The law was defeated on account of lack of information, 
misunderstanding, indifference, and opposition to even a tax 
of two mills or less to pay the tuition of a few rural school graduates 
at the village or city high schools. Many district* refused 
to vote on the question. In many the law was &lt;*&gt;nfased 
with the Rural High School measure, Subdivision VI, Sections 
9-19 (House Roll No. 227). In others the opinion, prevailed 
that it meant consolidation of districts and transportation of 
pupils. Many voters thought it benefited the high school districts 
at the expense of the rural districts. 

In the counties where the proposition carried, I belie-. 
was made clear to the voters through the weekly press and 
circular letters of the county superintendent that (he adjunct 
district bad no officers, voted no bonds, builded no schoolhouses, 
and did not interfere with rural school district organizations. 
In Douglas county, where the adjunct district was 
established last year, the county commissioners recently decided 
upon a levy of fifteen mills for the county, and then 
devoted one and one-fourth mills of that amount to the high 
school fund under this free high school attendance law. In 
Jefferson county, at a meeting held in the npring. the school 
officers' association declared in favor of "the proposition to 
pay, from a fund levied for that purpose, the tuition of nonresident 
eighth grade pupils in any approved high school hi </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

the county. " This proposition had been explained as the adjunct 
school district, having no officers and no organization. 
The Madison county circular stated that a favorable vote on 
this matter simply meant that the county instead of the individual 
parents would stand the expense of tuition in high 
schools. same circular showed that whereas the cities 
and maintain their high schools at an expense of 
five mills or more, often in excess of ten mills, the adjunct 
district of Madison county, if established, would be taxed only 
a small fraction of one mill for access of rural school graduates 
to all the advantages, rights and privileges of these 
established high schools. 

In Antelope county, where the largest majority in favor of 
the establishment of the adjunct district was cast, Supt. J. M. 
Richardson made personal visits and talked to the schools, the 
teachers, individual patrons, and members of school district 
boards in favor of the law. He also sent out a number of 
circular letters on the subject to teachers and to school board 
officers. He conducted in person eighth grade examinations 
at eight different points in the county between April 24 and 
May 6. In his circular of February 4 to his teachers, announcing 
the eighth grade examinations, he said: "The Adjunct 
District law will certainly carry at the June election if our 
people understand it. Let teachers and pupils join hands with 
the county superintendent explaining this law "to the patrons 
and voters and thereby awaken sufficient interest to promote 
intelligent investigation on the part of voters. Students 
interested should inform themselves as to the benefits of this 
law and not only visit every voter in the district in its interest, 
but attend the annual meeting and champion our cause there." 

In announcing the result of these "eighth grade examinms, 
Supt. Richardson made the following plea : "I hope 
ry district will vote in favor of the Free High School 
junct district) law. Your children may not be ready to 
e advantage of this law ; your neighbors' are, and yours 
1 be ready. Your teacher can do better work in all the 
r er grades by continually pointing them to the end of the 
mtry school course and stimulating them to greater efforts 
,t they may meet the eighth grade examination. That

be greatly benefited, there can be no doubt. The twenty six 
country pupils examined averaged up well with the eighth 
grade of the several town schools. If you will vote favorably 
on the Adjunct District law, I feel sure that in two or three 
years these examinations will show the country pupils eoual to 
the best of the town schools in like grade. With this incentive 
before the pupils, teachers will be able to do better work than 

In his circular of May 26 to his school board officers, Supt 
•hardson wrote : ' 'Every district is asked to vote on the 
junct District law, at the annual meeting. This law should 
eive a unanimous vote in its [favor, as it will help all sad 
detrimental to none. It provides that students may attend 
i high schools of the county, after finishing the country 
iool, tuition to be paid from a county fund. The Adjunct 
strict has no officers , it builds no scboolhouses, it votes 
bonds, it changes no boundaries, it interferes in no way 
;h the business or affairs of school districts." 

And again under date of June 25, the Antelope county superintendent 
addressed his school board officers as follows: 
"The effect of a favorable vote on the "Adjunct District law 
places country children on a par with those of the town 
schools. Town and city children are educated at public expense 
from the kindergarten through the university, but 
children in the country schools get the benefit of public money 
up to the eighth grade only. Such discrimination is unjust" 
Supt. Richardson also prepared a letter on the establishment 
of the adjunct district of Antelope county and similar subjects 
to be read at the annual school meetings in the county. See 
also "The Adjunct District of Antelope County" in The Nebraska 
Teacher for September, 1902, page 106. 

E'his patient, progressive and persistent campaign in favor 
i free high school education for the farmers' children in 
telope county resulted in 497 votes for and only 180 Tolas 
tinst the measure, thanks to the efforts of Supt. J. M. 
thardson. 

Ei the counties where the adjunct district has been tabed, 
the following high schools have been approved by the 
e superintendent as meeting the requirements of the law :

My Dear Superintendent: 

A business session of the county superintendents of Nebraska 
will be held in the Capitol building, at Lincoln, the 
afternoon and evening of Tuesday, December 30, 1902, for 
the discussion of School Law. This early announcement is 
sent out that you may be thinking about it, and making notes. 
Later I will ask you for suggestions : laws that should be repealed,laws 
that should be amended, measures that should be enacted 
into law. These I will ask you to put into legal form : Be it 
enacted by the legislature oftlie State of Nebra/tka,ebc. I will make 
ninety or more mimeograph copies of each proposed law for 
use at the business sessions. The county superintendents will

asures, and by a majority, three-fifths or two-thirds vote, 
may be determined upon, amend, pass or "kill" them. Then

M'KINLEY TO YOUNG MEN 

In his famous trip across the&gt;ountry, President McKinJej 
used the following language in an address to the young men 
in the University of Virginia: "Let me assure you. young 
gentlemen, that the present and the future hold rich reward 
for good scholarship, high character and noble endeavor . mm! 
the wish which I leave with you is that of these 70a m»y 
have your full share." 

HIGHER SALARIES 

I have heard men argue warmly — hotly — against any 
increase of a school principal's salary above $60 or $70 per 
month (for the nine months in the year) — men who are enjoying 
a salary of from $100 to $300 a month the year 'round, 
including vacation period, in grosser lines of work 

YOUTH OF TEACHERS 

I had occasion last April to gather some statistics relative 
to the ages of teachers of the rural schools of Nebraska. 
Nine counties near the head of the alphabetical list and in 
different parts of the state reported 654 teachers in the rural 
schools, 45 of whom were under 18 years of age. 79 were 18, 88 
were 19,200 were twenty and the other 245 were over 20 years 
of age. One couuty in western Nebraska reported 46 teachers, 
12 under 18 years of age and 6 were 18 years of age. 

NEW SCHOOL BUILD 

The word that comes to this department almost daily of the 
construction of new scboolhouses on approved lines and modern 
in comfort and convenience, and of the re -construction and 
improvement of old school buildings, is most gratifying. If 
you are not in possession of our illustrated publication,

GENTLEMEN TEACHERS 

Kundreds have recently gone out into school work in Neika 
as lady teachers and — gentleman teachers (why not? 

I lady is good so is gentleman !) and we hope their pupils will 
luct themselves as ladies and gentlemen, — polite and kind 
gentle. But if our teachers will go forth as men and tvomen 
tie truest, fullest, noblest sense of those misused and miserstood 
terms, and by precept and example train their 
ils to good citizenship and noble endeavor, to worthy 
ives and truthfulness, honesty and trustworthiness — in a 
*ough preparation for living as manly men and womanly 
len, the lady and gentleman phase of the situation will take 
! of itself. 

MENTAL ARITHMETIC AND READING 

It would mean much to the schools of Nebraska if at the 
ehers' county institutes next year county superintendents 
re to have an expert instructor give two drills each day in 
ntal arithmetic, perhaps twenty minutes in length each; 
11s that .would be inspiring, helpful and suggestive. It would 
an much more if reading appeared on every institute proun, 
one class in primary reading and another in advanced 
bding. In the latter class there should be expert instruction 
the institute as a whole, and there should be class instrucn 
in sections or divisions in which teachers should be taught 
iding by being required to read ; let them discover their own 
aknesses in this respect by comparison. I have examined 
my institute programs this summer and on nearly a score 
them I found no mental arithmetic or reading.

these may be noted Fillmore, and there are probably others of 
which we do not know. 

A comparison of the salaries in the Educational Directory

NEBRASKA TEACHERS' READING CIRCLE 

1901-1902. 

A permanent and necessary adjunct of the State school 
system, for teachers of all grades. 

Within the past year the Teachers' Reading Circle of Nebraska 
has grown in membership in a large majority of the 
counties. While the membership is voluntary, it should 
include ALL the public school teachers of the State.of whatever 
age or experience, and of whatever grade of professional and 
personal culture. Desultory reading cannot take the place 
of systematic work, nor can local clubs answer the purpose of 
a State organization. The more exacting demands upon the 
teachers of the present day require united professional work 
along the whole line. The Reading Circle Board makes its 
appeal to the county and city superintendents, and to the 
teachers generally, to unite in promoting the Reading Circle 
interests, to the end that the enrollment in each county shall 
constitute at least a very large proportion of the teachers 
actually engaged in the work of the public schools.

book is the result of the lamented author's life-long investigation 
of the subject of pedagogics. The book is not one to be 
lightly read, but to be carefully and thoughtfully canvassed in 
every part. It should be used as a manual throughout the Institute 
session. Through the year it should be used for home study 
and constant reference in the light of the Institute discussions 
and of current experience. For some teachers who have 
not followed the work in preceding years, it may be found 
desirable to substitute for this book, or to use in addition to 
it, some of the professional books previously used— such as 
White's Elements of Pedagogy (which includes psychology), 
White's School Management, King's School Interests and 
Duties, or Roark's Method in Education. Such substitution 
is permitted to Reading Circle members who have not previously 
used the substituted books, and full credit will be 
given for all work done. A good text-book in pedagogics, 
such as the Reading Circle supplies, should be in the hartda 
of every teacher in attendance at the Institute. 

In addition to the professional work, one book on general 
culture should be studied. The Nebraska Legislature in the 
session of 1901 made an amendment to the School Laws of 
Nebraska requiring that, after July 1. 1903. applicants for 
certificates of the first and second grades "shall pass a satisfactory 
examination in the elements of agriculture, including 
a fair knowledge of the structure and habits of the common 
plants, insects, birds and quadrupeds." Bailey's Principles 
of Agriculture has been adopted to enable the teacher to comply 
with the law. It can be used as a text during the Institute, 
and as a guide to work with pupils throughout the year. The 
book has been prepared to meet the needs of schools and rural 
societies, is a clear presentation of the science of agriculture, 
and shows the relative practical importance of its various 
parts. It is popular in its form, while scientific in its accuracy, 
and will, prove most interesting and profitable. Agriculture 
is an industry of such vast importance in our national life, and 
particularly in Nebraska, that an acquaintance with its essential 
principles is deemed indispensable to the progressive 
teacher. A knowledge of Professor Bailey's book will amply </seg>

THE ART OF STUDY 

Hinsdale's Art of Study has been written with the avowed 
purpose uf readjusting, in a measure at least, the relations 
existing between the teacher and his pupils. It'seeks to shift 
the center of gravity in the school. Its purpose, as announced, 
at once awakened a strong desire on the part of the educational 
public to read the book which embodies the results of its 
author's life-long study of the art of teaching. The volume 
proved to be his masterpiece, as well as his last gift to the 

The impression that comes to the reader of this book 
is of the keen insight and discrimination of the writer, which 
is everywhere manifest; and the next, of the limpid clearness 
with which the ideas are expressed. As the subject is developed, 
the volume discloses a worldwide field of observation, 
with which the author was familiar; also a wide range of educational 
history which was at his fingers' ends. 

Ehis shifting of the center of gravity is not, therefore, a 
ltly considered or merely experimental proposition. It is a 
elusion reached from the most fruitful experience and the 
it profound and philosophical thought of the educational 
•Id. 

EPhe book possesses the interest of a story. It is instinct 
;h life from its frequent citing of the words of notable writers 
1 thinkers. The book is modern in its method and form. It 
itains, at the end of each chapter, a list of parallel readings 
¦efully selected, thus forming a symposium of the literature 
the subject treated. 

PRINCIPLES OF AGRICULTURE 

In the production of its wealth, agriculture operates in three 
great fields, — with the soil, the plant, and the animal. 
Although aided at every point by a knowledge of other subjects, 
its final success rests upon these bases, and these are 
the fields to which Bailey's Principles of Agriculture gives </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Agriculture is often said to be the most fundamental and 
most useful of occupations, since it feeds the world. The 
province of a text book of agriculture is to deal with the original 
production of agricultural wealth rather than with its 
manufacture, transportation or sale. It is founded upon laws, 
but there are those who would have us believe that it is chiefly 
the overcoming of mere obstacles, as insects, unpropitious 
weather and the like. 

The subject of agriculture is being taken up very generally 
by schools throughout the middle west. This book is intended 
to supply the demand for a broad knowledge of the subject, both 
general and specific. It regards farming as a business, to 
which science may be made to contribute a large measure of 
success. It is a practical treatment of a very practical subject 
and it is equally good for teachers of all grades, for the 
student in advanced classes in school, or for the private 
reader. 

The general plan of the book is to state fundamental principles 
in terse language without very much explanation. In 
order to cover so much ground, it was necessary to make 
the text very brief. It was considered that the book should not 
run beyond three hundred pages, else it would be so large as 
to interfere with its general usefulness. The bald and bare 
statement of principles is likely to be dry and uninteresting 
however, and therefore some incidental and explanatory 
remarks were placed in small type at the end of each chapter. 
Principles themselves never need pictures to illustrate them ; 
but the applications of these principles are often made 
plain by the use of engravings. Therefore the engravings are 
placed in the explanatory text rather than in the preliminary 
statements. 

The whole book is itself a skeleton or outline of the subject. 
It is expected that the reader will fill it in as he goes along, by 
discussion and by reading other books, bulletins and agricultural 
papers. Some useful references will be found in the 
explanatory matter. 

Spend at least one meeting on the Table of Contents for the 
purpose of getting a general knowledge of the whole subject of 
agriculture. This book is made for adults or for those who 
are old enough to grasp a general view of the subjects included </seg>

in agriculture. I think that it is well to have all these subjects 
in mind at the outset so that the relative importance of 
each may be known and understood. 

It will be noticed that the Introduction is concerned with a 
general statement of what agriculture is. It has three coordinate 
divisions, as may be seen by the analysis on page IX. 
The first division attempts to define agriculture, the second to 
discuss the personal attributes upon which successful agriculture 
depends, and the third defines the field of its endeavor. 
Under section 1 are to be found a definition of agriculture, 
paragraphs 1. 2, la, 2a ; what agriculture contributes to the 
world, 3, 3a; what agriculture is, 4, 4a, 4b; definitions of agriculture, 
5-9, 8a, 9a. In section 2, it is explained how successful 
farming depends on the executive ability of the 
farmer, in paragraphs 10 — 12 ; how it depends on a knowledge 
of science, 13 — 20; how complicated the business of agriculture 
is, 21, 21a, 21b. In section 3, there is an outline of the things 
with which agriculture deals, in paragraphs 22, 22a. 22b.

WORK FOR THE YEAR 

The Nebraska Teachers' Beading Circle Board has selected 
Nature Study and Life as the central book for the year's work. 
This book teachers must read in addition to one or more of 
the six optional books selected by the Board in order to receive 
credit for doing the required work of the Nebraska Teachers' 
Reading Circle. 

I Nature Study and Life" has twice formed the basis for nature 
dy courses in the Clark University Summer School ; it has 
ther stood the more practical test of teachers' institutes in 
¦ious states; and, finally, its most important suggestions 
ve been tried thoroughly in the schoolroom. The work 
i tains the results of five years' special study. In the point 
view in the selection of the subject-matter, and in the preltation 
of methods of conducting the work, this book marks 
definite advance over other publications on the subject of 
ture study. 

It is a determined reaction against the special and technical, 
i forms an earnest effort to give fundamental and universal 
arests in nature their deserved place in our system of pubeducation. 
After presenting this point of view clearly in 
opening chapter, the book takes up concrete lessons on 
i animals and plants that form the natural environment of 
&gt;. home, and group themselves most closely about the life 
t interests of the child. Each form is studied alive and at 
rk, as a life story to be read at first hand in nature and 
tecially in its relations to man. </seg>

The Nebraska teachers' reading circle board has approved a 
number of lists of books submitted by publishing houses for 
use as school libraries, and the attention of superintendents, 
principals, teachers, and school boards is called to these lists 
and the prices for which the books may be obtained. The 
books in the lists were all carefully considered before the list 
was approved. The books are made up into $5, $10, and $15 
libraries, and by combination, $20, $25, and $30 libraries, and 
so on, may be purchased. Each library will be sent to any 
railroad or express office in the state, transportation prepaid, 
and sectional book cases may be purchased of the nearest furniture 
dealer for a few dollars. The $5 libraries include two 
lists of 12 books each, one of 14 books, and two of 15 books 
each. The $10 libraries include one list of 23 books, one of 24 
books, one of 26 books and one of 32 books. There is also a 
$15 library of 47 books. There are very few duplicates in the 
lists. The last two lists mentioned contain no duplicates: 
therefore 79 books carefully selected and approved may be purchased 
for $25. Madison county has established a teachers' 
circulating library consisting chiefly of reading circle books. 
The library includes all of this year's list of books with one 
exception, and Silas Cobb and Phelps and His Teachers are 
included. The expense does not exceed one dollar for each 
teacher, and beside the privilege of reading a number of books 
the plan contemplates the ownership of one book by each 
teacher at the end of the year. 

The manager is pleased to note the increased interest in 
reading circle work this year over that of any previous year. 
Sixty-seven of the ninety counties in Nebraska have adopted 
and are using Hodge's Nature Study and Life. Two or three

THE PASSING OP THE RURAL SCHOOLMASTER 

I^be majority of the children of Nebraska attend the ungradrural 
schools, therefore all parents are concerned or at least 
erested in the Passing of the Rural Schoolmaster. 

this discussion will deal principally with the "passing" of 
rural schoolmaster, not with his "past". We will "let 
dead past bury its dead," and only incidentally refer to the 
fact that in Europe today, as in all the centuries of its history 
since the establishment of schools, the schoolmaster rules in 
the rural schoolhouse, and that the expression "schoolma'am" 
is an Americanism. In the British Isles and in France there 
has been a change in the ratio of women and men teachers of 
late years so that in Great Britain today there are a few more 
of the former than of the latter, while in France the number 
of each is almost exactly equal; on the rest of the continent 
of Europe the men teachers still largely outnumber the 
women. Permitting our thoughts to cross the Atlantic with 
the Mayflower, we find that the early establishment of schools 
was in connection with the churches, and that the clergy of 
the seventeenth century were, in the main, its schoolmasters. 
Soon after their arrival at Plymouth the Pilgrims voted that 
some action should be taken "that in every town there may 
be a schoolmaster set up to train the children in reading and 
writing." Some fifty years later the Plymouth colonial legislature 
voted to appropriate the profits of the Cape Cod fisher»for 
school purposes. (This was before the establishment 
breweries and distilleries. ) 

The idea of a free public school grew in form very slowly. 
Colleges and Latin grammar schools were established, but 
these were for the boys and were taught by men, often clergymen. 
In early colonial days ehildren were taught to read the 
catechism and the Bible and to write, if taught at all. in their 
Ees and in dames' schools. This school dame of early New 
land days may have been the prototype of the modern 
trican schoolma'am, but there are differences in detail. </seg>

These dame schools were, as a rule, small private schools held 
in the homes of their school mistresses, and they fitted the 
boys for "admission to the Latin schools, teaching them "to 
read the English language by spelling the same," and fitting 
the girls^for life; at least, the girls did not go beyond the dame 
schools until about a century ago. Prom these early dame 
schools grew up very gradually the modern primary school. 

In the rural districts of New ; England, however, the disctively 
rural school was established, and this was open to 
bh sexes on the same footing from the age of five years. It 
lld^not be otherwise. In these communities and their ' comm" 
schools, there was not, there could not be, distinctions 
class, age or sex. Ministers and teachers alike were elected 
town meeting, where a'direct property tax was voted by the 
aple, and this was the beginning of the free American rural 
nmon school and of the rural school master ; the school is 
II common, but its schoolmaster is now uncommon. 

" The early Dutch 'settlers of the New Netherlands established 
the church and the school together. In 1633, Adam Roelandson 
was sent over from the mother country to take charge of 
"The School of the Dutch Reformai Protestant Church," 
in the town of New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. This 
school is still in existence in 'New York City. This Dutch 
Church established "and maintained many schools, elementary 
in character, where instruction was given in reading and writine 
the'Dutch language, in arithmetic, in the catechism of the 
Dutch Church, and in the Bible. The seizure of the province 
by" the English in 1664 checked the development of these 
schools. Other schools were established, though slowly, by 
and under the control of the Church of England, and for a long 
period there were two sets of rival schools. These were eventually 
fused into a common system of schools. After the Revolutionary 
War the development of the public schools in the 
State of New York was more rapid than in the City of New 
York. Under an act of 18122 the office of state superintendent 
of schools was created, and under the law of 1841 county superintendents 
were appointed. Not until 1853 were the schools 
of New York City finally transformed into public schools. 
The system included primary and grammar schools, and a free 
academy for boys. This academy was chartered in 1866 under </seg>

Pof ' 'College of the City of New York. " It is as free 
ilic schools of the city. I attended the primary and 
chools of New York City in the 70's, and my last three 
i the grammar department, and the principal of that

ew York, and at that time there was not a woman 
there. Gen. Alex. S. Webb was the president. In 
Dity and. the State of New York the percentage of 
ers has been reduced by one- half in the last twenty 

At one time then, the schoolmaster reigned almost supreme 
in the land, his "right there was none to dispute," save an 
occasional school dame, and she was across the boundary line. 
She did not come into direct competition with the early schoolmaster. 
The two then occupied different fields, and only with 
the amalgamation during the past sixty years of the dame 
school, the primary or common 'school, the rural school, the 
fee school and the free school, the public school, the private 
and parochial and denominational schools, the elementary 
grammar schools, the Latin grammar school, the Latin high 
school, the academy, the public high school, all secondary 
schools, the college and the university into one grand common 
school system with the kindergarten as the foundation stone 
and the university as the cap stone ; — state systems, it is true, 
instead of national; — but, I repeat, that only with the modern 
reorganization and partial interdependence of all these parts 
of our great common school system has the school mistress 
been thrown into direct competition with the schoolmaster, in 
all lines of school work, and she is rapidly crowding him out. 
Particularly is this true in public school work, and more 
especially in the ungraded or rural schools. Our fathers talk 
of little red schoolhouse and its schoolmaster. We now 
have the white schoolhouse and its school mistress or school- 

Prof. Hugo *Munsterberg writes on this subject as follows : 

i'The primary school is today absolutely monopolized by 
men teachers, and in the high school they have the overelming 
majority. The reason for this is clear : since the 
man does not have to support a family, she can work for a 
aller salary, and thus, as in the mills, the men tend more 
I more toward the places for which women are not strong </seg>

            <seg id="p158">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

enough ; in the schools, too, female competition must, if no 
halt is called, bring down salaries to a point from which 
the supporter of a family must retreat. It would be, of course, 
in both cases better if the earnings were larger, and more 
men were thus enabled to support families, while in the 
schoolroom, as in the mill, the female competitor brings the 
earnings down to a point where the man is too poor to marry 
her, — a most regrettable state of affairs. But the economic 
side is here not so important as the effect on civilization. 
Even granting, what I am not at all ready to grant, that 
woman's work, preferred because it is cheaper to the community, 
is just as good as man's work, can it be without danger 
that the male youth of this country, up to the eighteenth 
year, are educated by unmarried women? Is it a point to be 
discussed at all that 'nascent manhood requires for right development 
manly inspiration, direction, and control'? Where 
will this end? That very soon no male school teacher of good 
quality will survive is certain, but there is no reason to expect 
that it will stop there. We have already today more than 
sixty per cent of girls among the upper high school classes, 
and this disproportion must increase. Must we not expect that 
in the same way in which the last thirty years have handed 
the teacher's profession over to the women, the next thirty 
years will put the ministry, the medical calling, and, finally, 
the bar also into her control? To say this is not to be feared 
because it has never happened anywhere before is no longer 
an argument, because this development of our schools is also 
new in the history of civilization. There was never before a 
nation that gave the education of the young into the hands of 
the lowest bidder." 

But nut only has the schoolmistress crowded out the schoolmaster 
to a great extent, but it should be noticed also that 
the early colonial schools were organized principally and 
almost exclusively for boys, that the curriculum* was adapted 
to the needs of the boys, and although it has grown and 
expanded it has not been changed materially, but that the girls 
in the grammar grades of our public schools now outnumber 
the boys about 4 to 3, in the high schools about 3 to 2, and in 
the senior classes 2 to 1. 

Mr. S. Y. Gillan, of Milwaukee, publishes the following 
under the heading, "Why do Men Teach?" 

"Some men teach because they feel that they have 'a call' ; 
some because they believe that in this way they are able most 
effectively to 'do good' ; others teach because they like to teach 
— 'a love for the work' is a common cant phrase for this motive. </seg>

PASSING OF RURAL SCHOOLMASTER. 

Many teach because they have found, or tnink they have 
found, that on the whole they can do as well or better, financially, 
in this occupation than in any other. Usually this 
class are cruelly undeceived before they reach fifty. Teaching 
as a business in America is rapidly passing over to the 
women; and men might as well face this fact and make their 
calculations accordingly. There is still left some chance for a 
career for a man in school supervision, but even this is precariou 
— almost as uncertain as politics." 

IJthough my subject should confine my discussion to the rural 
oolmaster, I cannot refrain from quoting from the address 
Dr. A .E. Winship, of Boston, on "The Future of Women 
tchers, " delivered before the Chicago Teachers' Federation, 
)ruary 15 last. Dr. Winship referred to the position and 
uence of women teachers in cities as follows : 

E Regarding these children in the elementary schools, more 
a ninety-five per cent of the teaching in cities and large 
ns is done by women, and more than ninety-five per cent 
the administration and leadership is by men. In school 
rds, in supervision, in making courses of study, in the 
sction of school books, in deciding upon the length of the 
n and of the day, in establishing rules, in the management 
educational associations, and in the selection of teachers, 
1 have ninety-five per cent of the influence. What does 

En the first place, it does not signify that woman is to be 
ranced by the retirementfof men. It will be a calamity to 
Chen as well as to men, to the country as well as to the 
Id, if men lose absolute influence to any degree. There is 
indant honor for all in the grand and glorious conquests of 
lolarship and character foreshadowed in the revolution for 
ich 1 plead. Nor do I plead for the rights of woman. The 
hts are those of our country and of the child. 

Why do the women have less than five per cent of the leadership 
and more than ninety-five per cent of labor? Because 
women are supposed to be specially adapted to obedience — as 
per the marriage vow — to the execution of details, and toother 
phases of service, and because they are not supposed to have 
the wisdom, the discretion, the energy, to plan and to admin- 

Who have formed this judgment upon which rests the decision 
of five per cent of leadership and ninety-five per cent of 
labor for women? Why, the men, of course. The five per 
cent men have done the thinking for the ninety-five per cent 
women. To say the least, the situation is highly interesting 
— to the women. If the judgment of the men regarding the </seg>

            <seg id="p162">
134 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

judgment of the men concerning the lack of wisdom, discretion, 
and energy of women is correct), then some interesting 
questions arise. 

What reasons do the men assign for their estimate of women? 
They have given no specific reasons. They assume it. They 
do, however, say that there should be a larger percentage of 
men teachers because boys need the masculine mind; that is, 
the masculine mind says that boys need the masculine mind. 
I have been guilty of saying that myself. It is refreshing to 
a man to say it. Now I decline to accept it without some 
other evidence than a man's luxury of thus glorifying himself. 
In the meantime, while men are preparing their case, one proposition 
may be considered. 

if boys do need the masculine mind, then they should have 
they need of it. If they need it at all, they need it from 
yen years of age upward, and it is a national disgrace, and 
rime against humanity that ninety-five per cent of the teachin 
elementary grades is by women. If this assumption is 
e. then the men should teach the boys, and the women 
uld do the overseeing. There is no argument in the 
sculine mind idea that accounts for the women's having but 
; per cent of influence. 

It may be that boys reverence leadership and not masculinity. 
A child study enthusiast gave a series of questions to American 
children, one of which was : ' 'Who is your highest ideal of 
success, or, whom would you prefer to be or to have been?" 
Washington or Lincoln was the general choice. The same 
question in England brought for an answer : Queen Victoria. 
This was as true of boys as of girls. 

Assuming, then, for argument's sake that what bovs reverence 
is leadership and not masculinity, and assuming, which is 
undoubtedly true, that ninety-five per cent of the teaching in 
elementary schools will continue to be done by women, is it 
not a logical conclusion that women should be given an opportunity 
to be leaders, to reveal to the boys their capability of 
leadership, and opportunity to inspire in boys a reverence for 
themselves as leaders? 

What we need is a committee to make a study after the plan 
of the Committee of Ten as to these points : — 

Eirst. Does the masculine mind need the masculine mind 
merely great leadership? 

E'cond. If the masculine mind reverences leadership, how 
the ninety-five per cent of their teachers be eiven an opunity 
to reveal the power of leadership or to develop great- 

EE course such a committee should consist of equal propors 
of men and women. It would be cruel to suggest that 
ty-five per cent should be women on the ground that </seg>

            <seg id="p163">
135 


K sty-five per cent of the acquaintance with school boys is 
inine. " 

But before proceeding farther with generalizations and 
opinions on the ratio of men and women teachers in the land, 
perhaps I should furnish some reliable statistics on the subject 
from authentic sources. (No reflection here on the gentleman 
just quoted !) We all know that although the total number of 
teachers in the United States has steadily increased from 
decade to decade, and at certain periods in our history this 
increase has been very rapid, we also know, though in a very 
dim way. that the percentage of male teachers has steadily 
decreased. In many states the number of male teachers has 
decreased. There are very few reports in existence of statistics 
previous to 1870, either national or state, that will furnish 
us definite information on this question. On page LXXII of 
the report of the United States Commissioner of Education for 
1899-1900, we find that during the year 1870-71 the male teachers 
were 41 per cent of the entire corps. In 1879-80 they were 
nearly 43 per cent. Ten years later they were only 34$ per 
cent, and in 1899-1900 they were but little more than 30 per 
cent. Glancing at the details of that table, we find that the 
North Atlantic division has at present only 18$ per cent of 
maie teachers, while the South Central division has 47 per 
cent. In the North Central division we find that • in 1870-71 
the percentage of male teachers was a little more than 43 per 
cent, in 1879-80 a little below 42 per cent, in 1889-90 about 32 
per cent, and in 1899-1900 about 29 per cent. Twelve states 
are included in this North Central division, and in no one of 
them has there been such a marked decline in the percentages 
of male teachers as in the case of Nebraska, which had in 
1870-71 52 per cent, in 1879-80 41 per cent, in 1889-90 27 per 
cent, and in 1899-1900 less than 22 per cent.

many state superintendents' reports and letters, I have compiled

Many of the letters of the state superintendents in reply to 

my request for statistics on the percentages of male teachers 
in the public schools of their respective states during certain 
years contain in addition significant statements, all of which 
I append. I omit none that you may appreciate the equanimity 

of opinion on this subject in different sections of the country. 
J. J. Doyne, Arkansas: 
"You will note that the number of female teachers is on the 

increase. Two reasons may be assigned for this : First, they 
are more willing than male teachers to take a normal course 
of study ; hence, their services are more acceptable. Second, 
while deserving as much as the male teachers, they are content 
to work for lower wages, and do not become disgruntled in 

consequence of the small pay they receive." 
Thomas J. Kirk, California: 

It is very evident that the men are dropping out of the pro- 

Eion of teaching in this state. The figures do not show 
real truth. In 1871 there were no high schools recorded 
t year we had 289 men and 292 women in the high schools.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Richard C. Barrett, Iowa : 

' 'In 1898 the Supreme court in the case of Burkhead vs. 
Independent district of Independence decided that the statutes 
of Iowa do not give to boards of directors authority to 
employ teachers for more than a single school year at any one 
time. As a consequence there is quite general unrest among 
superintendents, principals, and teachers, in cities and towns 
especially. For the year ending in September, 1900, there 
were fewer male teachers by six hundred in our schools than 
were engaged in teaching the previous year, while the percentage 
of males decreased from thirty-nine percent in 1870 to 20.4 
per cent in 1899. Many men occupying positions considered 
among the best have voluntarily abandoned teaching, in part 
because of the short term of service for which contracts may 
be drawn. Young men about to choose their work for life 
hesitate to enter upon a profession that offers only an annual 
contract. The people themselves seldom choose an officer for 
leas than two years. County and state officers are generally 
elected for two years; county supervisors and railroad commissioners 
are elected for three years; judges of district court 
for four, and supreme court judges for six years. The people 
are, I think, not averse to this order. A board of directors is 
a continuous body, and might with perfect safety be given 
authority tu elect its teachers for at least three years. Legislative 
action of this sort would encourage men to enter upon 
and continue longer in the service of teaching, which is very 
oesirable." 

Frank Nelson, Kansas: 

"Since the year 1880 there has been a steady relative decrease 
in the number of male teachers employed. I have never 
given this subject any special thought, but attribute this 
decrease to the fact that the remuneration for the work of 
school teaching has not increased as much as in other lines of 
work. This makes it more profitable for men to engage in 
other occupations, which are not open to women." 

Frank A. Hill, Massachusetts: 

I We have no data to show the relative number of male and 
tale teachers in our rural schools at stated intervals of time, 
now. however, that fifty years ago, the winter schools in 
small towns were taught almost universally by men and 
summer schools almost universally by women. Today the 
ools in our small towns are no longer known as summer 
. winter schools. They are kept continuously, with the

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

R relatives behind the movement to establish new 
" 

L. D. Harvey, Wisconsin 

"The school system of this state was first organized in 1848. 
An examination of the reports does not, however, show anything 
very satisfactory as to- the relative number of male 
and female teachers employed in the schools of the state until 
1862. Up to 1860 the schools of the state were supervised by 
town school superintendents, and it appears that the reports 
obtained from these officers were very meager and often unreliable. 
I am, however, able to guess with a reasonable 
degree of accuracy that up to 1860 or 1861 the number of male 
and female teachers hired each year was about equal. It seems 
that during the winter terms about nine-tenths of the teachers 
were males, and this proportion was reversed during the summer. 
The winter schools in the early history of the state 
were very large, and frequently attended by persons more 
than twenty years of age. The people generally considered 
a woman incompetent to control such a school. In 1862, I find 
that the number of male teachers employed during the winter 
was 2349; during the summer, 418; while of female teachers, 
the number employed in the winter was 1810, and in the summer 
3462. The statistics at this time included those teaching 
in what were then cities, as well as what we now call rural 
districts. In fact, in the compilation all the way through, 
the statistics are divided only as to cities under city superintendents 
and towns, villages and cities under county superintendents. 
I have not given the statistics for the forty or fifty 
cities under city superintendents. In 1867, the number of 
males employed was 1822 ; of females employed, 5059. In 1872, 
the number of males certificated was 2266; of females, 5007. 
There is evidently some inconsistency in these statistics, but 
I am unable to tell you where it is. In 1877, the number of 
males certificated was 3075 ; and of females, 6214. The number 
of males certificated in 1882 was 1873; females, 5753. In 
1887, males 1969; females 6789. In 1892, males 1836; females 
7289. In 1897, the number of males certificated was 1953, 
while the number employed was 2218; and the number of 
females certificated was 6627, and employed 7582. This apparent 
discrepancy arises from the fact that first grade certificates 
are good for four years, second for two years and that a considerable 
number of teachers, both male and female, hold countersigned 
normal school, umiversity and college diplomas, and 
limited and unlimited state certificates. In 1900, the number of 
males certificated was 1396; the number of females, 6007. It 
may interest you to know that of these, 147 males received 
first grade certificates, 324 second grade, 925 third grade ; while </seg>

PASSING OP RURAL SCHOOLMASTER. 

810 women received first errade certificates, 1312 second grade, 
and 4385 third grade. 

I might add here that it is an unusual thing to find a man 
teaching in a school during the summer, unless he holds a position 
as principal in a graded or high school." 

We are all familiar with the situation here at home in 
Nebraska. The numoer of men teachers in the ranks is decreasing 
very rapidly. The highest number ever employed in 
the state was 2861, in 1890. Since that time it has wavered 
along about 2500, 2400, 2300, dropping to 2133 in 1893, rebounding 
to 2700 in 1896, (remember the times!) dropping again to 
2038 in 1899, and 2062 in 1900. Last year (1901) the number 
reported was 1840. This year (1902) the number is 1862. All 
this time there has been a steady increase in the number of 
women teachers and the total number of teachers employed. 
We usually ascribe low salaries as the chief cause for the decrease 
in the number of men teachers employed from Jyear to 
year. If we insist upon that we must make our comparisons 
between the salaries paid for teaching and the salaries paid in 
the other professions and in the trades and the various lines 
of business, for the salaries of men teachers in Nebraska during 
the past twenty years show a slight increase from year to year 
with occasional variations. Previous to 1885 the average 
monthly salary of male teachers in the state never exceeded 
R00. In 1885 it jumped to $43.74, and until 1891 ranged 
veen that amount and $43.00. The latter year it advanced 
to $44.81, in 1892 to $45.20, in 1893 to $47.59, the highest in 
the history of the state, with the exception of the present 
year (1902). Prom that time to 1898 it gradually declined 
to $42.61. 'In 1899 it was $45.05, in 1900 $46.26, in 1901 
K 7 .54, and in 1902 $49.15. One must remember the condin 
of the country in connection with these years. Prom 
1872 until 1881 inclusive the average monthly salary of women 
teachers ranged along about $5.00 less than the men. From 1882 
to 1888 it varied from $6.00 to $9.00 less. Prom 1889 to 1892 
it was about $5.00 less. Since 1893 it has varied from $6.50 
less to nearly $10.00 less than the men receive. Last year 
(1901) the difference was $9.31. </seg>

agencies for the improvement of rural life, I desire to include 
the township or centralized graded rural school. Now here is 
a great topic! Shall I stop? The rural schoolmaster is disappearing. 
Let him go, — but not alone. The rural schoolmistress 
may accompany him. She should ! With the establishment 
of centralized graded rural schools will come a 
gigantic stride in the standing of teachers, a small reduction 
in the number of men teachers and a large reduction in the 
number of women teachers. See also pages 228-233 of School 
Buildings and Grounds in Nebraska, republished in this Report.

COUNTY INSTITUTES. 

In counties where teachers have opportunity for academic 
education in first class high schools the institute should give 
professional training. All questions should be treated from the 
standpoint of the teacher as a teacher rather than of the teacher 
as a student. Only instructors of professional merit should 
be engaged. The examination for certificates should be held 
before the institute and the teacher thus left free to study 
the newest and best methods of teaching rather than required 
to cram for a mere passing grade. Make the institute an inspirational 
uplift. One week in an institute on this plan is worth 
more than two weeks in an institute where everything bends 
in a harassing strain toward the examination under mediocre 
and unprofessional instructors. 

t counties where teachers have not had opportunity for 
lemic education or where they have been negligent relato 
such an education, a six weeks summer school, includa 
professional institute of one week at the close, offers an 
dlent opportunity for raising the qualifications of teachers. 

Eie county institute must bear in mind that it is dealing 
cipally with those who are to teach in the rural schools 
in the grades below the high school in village and small 
schools. Therefore, make the work meet the demands for 
8 schools. </seg>

UNION NORMAL INSTITUTES. 

The first union normal institute held in this state was organized 
by State Superintendent Geo. B. Lane, at Tecumseh, in 
1890. It comprised the counties of Johnson and Nemaha. A 
two years' program was planned, meeting at Tecumseh in 1890, 
for a four weeks' term ; at Auburn, in 1891, for a like term. I 
give herewith Supt. Geo. B. Lane's announcement for the 
session at Tecumseh : 

Lincoln, May 9, 1890. 

J. L. McBrien, County Superintendent, Tecumseh, Nebraska. 

Dear Sir : — By request of the two counties herein named, I 
hereby make the announcement that a Union Normal Institute 
will be held at Tecumseh, Nebraska, from July 16th to August 
13th, 1890. This Institute to be for the counties of Johnson 
and Nemaha, and to include the teachers of said two counties. 

J. L. McBrien and C. J. Pierson, County Superintendents 
of said counties, are appointed joint conductors and managers 
of said Institute with authority to employ instructors and 
incur such expenses as the joint institute funds of the said two 
counties may warrant. 

Ehese conductors have full authority to arrange the program 
decide upon such other arrangements as may be necessary 
are usually customary in County Institutes in this State.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Two counties like Johnson and Nemaha may thus plan for 
a two years' program in a union normal institute, holding the 
first session in one county and the second session in the other 
county, when it is not advisable for more than two counties to 
unite at a central point. In other words, it offers educational 
reciprocity to both counties concerned. Such a program must 
be inaugurated at a time when it can be carried out before a 
change would be likely to occur in the superintendenoy of 
either county. 

Irhile two counties thus uniting can offer better opportunii 
than the ordinary county institute, the full advantages of 
union normal institute are not secured unless four or five 
nties join in the enterprise as was done this past year at 
bertson by the counties of Chase, Hayes, Hitchcock and 
I Willow ; at Holdrege by the counties of Frontier, Gosper, 
¦Ian and Phelps ; and at Sidney by the counties of Banner, 
&gt;yenne, Kimball and Scotts Bluff. Joint institutes were also 
i at Hyannis for the counties of Grant, Hooker and McPher; 
at Tekamah for the counties of Burt and Thurston ; and at 
ighton for the counties of Knox and Pierce. 

Ebe following announcement of the Holdrege Union Normal 
itute gives the reasons of this department for the organizaof 
such institutes. Similar announcements were made 
tive to the institutes at Culbertson and Sidney. 

HOLDREGE UNION NORMAL INSTITUTE 

state of nebraska 
Department of Public Instruction 
LINCOLN. 

To Teachers, School Officers and Patrons: 

Irpon request of the superintendents of Frontier, Gosper, 
rlan and Phelps counties I hereby authorize the organiza-1 
of a Teachers' Normal Institute as provided by law (Sec-1 
2, Subdivision VIII, and Sections 1, 2 and 3, Subdivision 
School Laws of Nebraska for 1901), to be held at Holdrege, 
t&gt;r., commencing Monday, June 2, 1902, and continuing five 
jks; to be conducted by Superintendent J. F. Conner of the 
Idrege City Schools. As Saturday sessions will be held it 
kes in reality a six weeks' term. A normal institute will be

UNION NORMAL INSTITUTES. 

The teachers of Frontier county may attend at either Culbertson 
or Holdrege, according to their own convenience. It 
must be remembered, however, that attendance at a normal institute 
is as compulsory as at an institute held in the home 
countv. 

REASONS FOR THE INSTITUTE 

I jet me call your attention to the conditions which make 
chers' normal institutes a necessity in Nebraska at this 
ie. Each fall we have in the schools of this state over 
00 new, inexperienced teachers. Of the 9,000 teachers emiyed 
every year, but 5.5 per cent are graduates of a college 
university ; but 40 per cent have a high school education 
its equivalent ; 29 per cent receive less than a three years' 
?h school education, and 15 per cent have no high school 
ining. These figures show that less than 16 per cent have 
rthing like professional training. 

We have but one state normal school. It is doing excellent 
work, but it is situated in the southeast corner of the state, 
and owing to poor railroad facilities, it is difficult to reach 
from central and western Nebraska. We are not unmindful of 
the good work being done by the State University, the private 
schools and colleges, but the day has come for Nebraska to 
wake up and make better provision for the professional training 
of her teachers. Until our legislators are convinced that 
it is the part of economy as well as wisdom to make adequate 
provision for the professional training of our teachers by the 
establishment of more normal schools, "detached entirely 
from all other pursuits, with the single object in view — the 
preparation of teachers," — what shall we do for these central, 
northern and western counties? "God helps them that help 
themselves." Let several counties unite at a logical place in 
a teachers' normal institute for a six, eight, or ten weeks' term, 
and by a merging of funds place within reach of their teachers 
the advantages of a first-class normal school, if only for six 
weeks. This is nut the equal of a three years' course, or even 
one year, in our State Normal school, but its benefits are far 
superior to those of the ordinary county institute. The joint institute 
idea is endorsed by Chancellor Andrews, Inspector 
Crabtree and all leading educators of the state. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

THE FACULTY 

Superintendent J. F. Conner is conductor. He has served an 
apprenticeship in all lines of school work — rural school teacher, 
village principal, city superintendent and jinstitute instructor. 
He is a graduate of the Southern Iowa Normal school. 
He is an educator of well-known and approved educational 
opinions. In "the science and art of teaching and in the science 
and art of school government his work will be of great benefit 
to all teachers. His experience in the public schools of Iowa, 
Wyoming and Nebraska pre-eminently qualifies him for this 

Iiperintendent G. F. Warren of the Minden city schools 
teach the physical sciences. He is a graduate of the Uniity 
of Nebraska and has had several years' experience as 
school principal, city superintendent and instructor in 
ner schools and institutes. In mathematics and in the 
ices he is an expert. The fact that he is to do science work 
le University of Minnesota for the United States governt 
during July and August, 1902, is evidence of more than 
i reputation. He is in demand in the educational world 
,use of his merit as a school man. 

Miss Sadie B. Smith, principal of the Holdrege High School, 
is exceptionally strong in "English and history. She is a 
graduate of the Nebraska State Normal school. She has 
taught in the rural school, in the grades, and in the high 
school. She is accurate in her knowledge and skillful and 
inspiring in her methods of presentation. She is one of the 
best high school teachers in the state. Her work in the 
Holdrege summer school and normal institute will prove a 
valuable acquisition. 

One of the leading features of this institute will be a model 
school conducted by Mrs. Sarah Brindley of Columbus, who 
has made a "specialty of primary work for the past fifteen 
years. She is an experienced instructor at institutes and a 
successful conductor of model schools, and abreast the times 
in educational thought and practice. She adapts but never 
adopts the methods of the greatest experts — the masters — to 
the needs of her own room. She possesses that prime requisite 
of every successful teacher — a love of children. The op- </seg>

Dortunity to impart the result of her careful study and observation 
and ripe experience means an increased efficiency in the 
primary work of every teacher who takes advantage of it. 

I Che institute proper will commence June 23 and continue 
o weeks. In addition to the faculty already named for the 
tire term, we have secured Dean Charles Pordyce of the 
braska Wesley an University and Dr. Jacques W. Red way 
New York City, author of the Natural Geography, each for 
b week at the institute. Dean Fordyce needs no introction 
to the teachers of this state. He has no superior as an 
•titute instructor among Nebraska educators. Dr. Redway 
one of the greatest of modern geographers — an educator of 
tional reputation. 

The instructors for this institute are men and women of 
heart power as well as brain power. All are educators of 
broad scholarship. They possess a ripe experience, a rich 
fund of common sense and a successful record. Each one is 
peculiarly fitted for the work which he is to do. 

THE COURSE OF STUDY. 

By model school it is meant to have the work demonstrated 
by classes of children in the first, second and third grades in 
reading, numbers and language. The other features of the 
model school will comprise instruction in methods, busy work, 
nature study, etc. It will be a model school in fact as well as 
in name — a school in which the young teacher may have the 
benefit of actual exercise in the business of instruction under 
the direction of a model teacher. 

Instruction in the institute will include also the studies required 
for first, second and third grade certificates, especial 
emphasis being given to the common branches. The science 
and art of teaching and the science and art of school government 
will be treated in a common sense, practical manner. 

IPeachers should plan to take three or four academic studies, 
noting the remainder of their time to professional training 
the model school and in the science and art of teaching and 
i science and art of school government. To know the 
,tter to be taught, and to know it thoroughly, are of themves, 
though essential, not all that is required. There is 
teculiar art of teaching. The details of this branch are inlaustible, 
but it is hoped that the most important principles </seg>

            <seg id="p182">
150 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

may be brought within such a compass as to afford material 
benefit to those who pass even the short term of six weeks in 
the institute. The best method of governing a school — that 
is, of exercising such a moral influence in it as is most favorable 
to the improvement of the pupils — will form a very important 
part of the course designed to qualify teachers for 
their signal calling. How much is implied in the words, "to 
govern a school!" The instruction in this branch will, there, 
fore, dwell on the government of the youth as of paramount 
importance, as that part of the teacher's duty which demands 
the rarest union of qualities, wnich most tries the temper, and, 
when faithfully and judiciously performed, is must important 
and far-reaching in its results. ' 'Give me the child whose heart 
has embraced without violence the gentle love of obedience, 
in whom the sprightliness of youth has not encroached on 
deference for authority, and I would rather have him for my 
son, though at the age of twelve he should have his alphabet 
to learn, than be compelled to struggle with the caprice of a 
self-willed, obstinate youth whose bosom has become a viper's 
neat of the unamiable passions, although in early attainments 
he may be the wonder of the day. " 

A STRONG LECTURE COURSE 

There will be also a strong lecture course free to all teachers 
enrolled in the school. The list of speakers and entertainers

three days at this institute. 

THE DAILY PROGRAM 

A daily program will be sent out in due time showing the 
assignment of work for each instructor and the hour at which 
it will be given, thus allowing teachers an opportunity to plan 
for the classes in which they desire instruction. This will do 
away with any loss of time in organization. It makes it possible 
to start the regular work the morning of the first day 
of the term. The announcement of the dates for lectures will 
be made at the same time.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Erege board of education to all who attend this school, 
t would be well for teachers to bring text books and referbooks 
for the work they expect to do, if they have them, 
comparison of these rates with the cost of such oppores 
elsewhere you will find they cannot be equaled. 

IN SORE NEED, LEND A HAND 

The teachers of these counties are in sore need of a summer 
school and normal institute. They deserve it. They are 
worthy of it. They cannot afford to fail to take advantage of 
it. By comparing notes and exchanging thoughts, progressive 
ideas on problems of education throughout these counties will 
be unified. Tney who do not advance, recede. The great and 
far-reaching trusts committed to our care, as well as the spirit 
of the times in which we live, demand earnest and unremitting 
efforts to secure progress. This institute is organized solely in 
the interests of progress. Such an opportunity has never 
before been offered to the teachers in this section of Nebraska. 
Every teacher who is not a college or normal school graduate, 
and who expects to teach next year, is under obligations to the 
people to attend the entire term. And those who have never 
taught, but who contemplate teaching next year, should not 
apply for a certificate if they fail to attend this school the 
entire term, or some other good school for an equal period. 
Do not attend through fear of having your certificate revoked 
or of being refused a certificate for non-attendance, but through 
a desire to be profited in methods, in scholarship, in an 
increased love for the work. Those teachers who attend in 
this spirit the entire term, I recommend county superintendents 
to excuse from examination in every branch with a grade 
of 85 or above, and in addition thereto that a credit of 5 per 
cent be sriven in every such grade (or general average) to every 
teacher who attends the full term and who makes good use of 
every opportunity offered by this school. Further, every teacher 
who attends this school for the entire term will be worth at 
least $5 per month more to her school. I urge upon school 
officers, therefore, the plea of simple iustice, when I say that 
they should pay higher salaries to teachers who thus prepare 
for their work than to indifferent teachers who do not attend. 
There is no way to exalt our schools without the exaltation of

cooperation of every teacher, every school officer and every 
county superintendent of these counties in our efforts for bet- 

ter teachers and better schools. Yours for education.

SUCCESS OF HOLDREGE INSTITUTE. 

Our enrollment was over three-fourths as great as the en- 

rollment at the State Normal School, while the combined 

attendance here and at Culbertson was fifty per cent greater. 

This argues conclusively to me that a State Normal here 

would be well patronized. Supt. J. F. Conner, Conductor. 
July 7, 1902. 
The following set of resolutions, asked for and framed by 

teachers only, and adopted with a full vote and not one dis- 

senting, shows the feeling of the teachers composing the 

student body of the school, and it is safe to say that no person 

who attended more than two weeks will ever again be satisfied 

with an ordinary institute. 

RESOLUTIONS. 

Be it Resolved, That we, the teachers of Harlan, Gosper, 

Phelps and Frontier counties, in union normal institute as- 

sembled at Holdrege, Neb., express our appreciation (1) to the 

state department of education and to the county superintend- 

ents, Mrs. Dobson, Miss Johnson, Mr. Bieithaupt and Mr. 

Larson, for the wisdom and untiring effort in planning and 

organizing this Holdrege union normal institute. (2) To 

Supt. Conner, to whose able management the institute owes 

its grand success and for the efficient instruction given by him 

in his subjects. (3) To our instructors, Miss Smith, Mrs. 

Brindley, Supt. Warren, Prin. Bradford. Dr. Redway and 

Dean Fordyce, who not only have given us instruction that 

will be of greatest help to us in our school work, but have 

also inspired us with higher ideals, greater zeal and enthus- 

iasm and a nobler ambition as teachers. (4) To the school 

board of Holdrege for the use of the buildings, grounds, books </seg>

            <seg id="p188">

and appliances which they have sc kindly furnished. (5) To 
the churches for the use of their buildings for lectures and 
chapel exercises. (6) To the citizens of Holdrege for their 
hospitality and cordial -welcome to visiting teachers. (7) To 
the lecturers for the inspiration and help of their addresses. 
(8) To the local papers for their kindness in publishing announcements 
and other notices. 

Be it further resolved, that as we have derived greater 
benefit from the union -normal institute than could possibly 
have been derived from institutes held in the separate counties, 
we unanimously recommend that the state department of 
education and the county superintendents of Harlan, Frontier, 
Gosper and Phelps counties be requested to arrange for a 
similar union normal institute next year. 

El it further resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be 
ted in the county papers of Harlan, Frontier, Gosper and 
lps counties. 

Signed by the committee this 3d day of July, 1902, at

FROM SUPERINTENDENTS. 

Ehe success of this school depended upon two things — the 
ice of instructors and the co-operation of the teachers. 

E choosing tha faculty, the state department deserves great 
it. No better talent for organizing and conducting such a 
ol could be found, we believe, in the state. 

I he work of Dr. Redway and Dean Fordyce was a strong 
profitable feature of the institute. The doctor's world-9 
reputation alone is enough to insure our readers that in 
we had an instructor such as seldom visits Nebraska inltes. 
Dean Fordyce is so well known to the teachers of 
state that his name is an inspiration. No one ever listens 
is lectures on psychology or nature study without being 
Lied with the wonders of nature and nature's God. His 
ling lecture, "That Boy," is one of which Nebraska audi)s 
have never tired. 

Of the second factor in the success of the school, the attendance 
reported above explains fully how well the teachers did 
their part. We are exceedingly well pleased with the attendance 
of the teachers from Harlan county as compared with that </seg>

Pher counties represented. However, we could not be 
satisfied until every teacher who labors in the schools 
)unty receives the benefit of this or some other good 

Superintendent Harlan County. 

In my opinion the union normal institute is the institute for 
us here in the west. Living, as we do, quite a ways from the 
normal schools in the eastern part of the state, our teachers 
cannot afford to travel so far to attend a summer term of only 
five or six weeks. The summer normal takes the place of 
these summer terms, and is within reach of all. Teachers that 
attended our normal this year cannot speak too highly of it, 
and are anxiously asking if we are to have a similar one next 
year. School boards and patrons, when they learned what 
was really taught, and what advantages were offered, heartily 
endorsed it. I am positive, should we have another one here 
next year, it would be still more successful than the one just 

I he instruction received in the model school, in primary 
bods and the pedagogy classes seems to have been most 
reciated ; undoubtedly because it was most needed. Several 
ur teachers have been at work, since school closed, preparmaterial 
for their primary work; hints secured at the norare 
being carried into practice. 

B shall do all I can in the future to make a union normal in 
neighborhood a success, and should we be fortunate 
ugh to have another one at Holdrege, our citizens, now 
wing what the normal really is, will do their part. 

E. E. Larson, 

Superintendent Phelps County. 

I believe the joint institute to be far superior to the county 
itute for the following reasons : We are enabled to secure 
best of instructors; we can have a larger and better iustiat 
less expense ; we can give the teachers the benefits of 
:ture course, which alone is worth the price of the tuition, 
coming together of so many teachers in one general insticannot 
help but be a wonderful source of inspiration, even 
tie dullest. I know I voice the sentiments of the teachers 
be county when I say that we heartily endorse the joint in- </seg>

stitute as the. best, the cheapest, and altogether the most desirable. 
Maud M. Johnson, 

Superintendent Gosper County. 

The Union Normal institute affords the best opportunity for 
professional training that has ever been brought within reach 
of the rank and file of teachers in western Nebraska. The 
practical merits of the plan have been demonstrated in the institutes 
at Holdrege and Culbertson. Those in attendance from 
this county are hearty in their appreciation of the management 
of these schools and the character of the work done. 

Mrs. Clara L. Dobson, 

Superintendent Frontier County. 

FROM INSTRUCTORS. 

One of the greatest educational needs of Nebraska is a num - 
ber of summer schools so situated that one may be reasonably 
accessible to each teacher in the state. These schools should 
be first-class in every respect, and should continue not less 
than ten weeks each summer. Their chief work should be to 
give professional instruction and training, and they should 
teach well the common branches. This academic work should 
not be merely a review. It should be deeper, clearer and 
broader than instruction can be given to children in the rural 
schools or in the eighth grade of our graded schools. It should 
teach the laws and principles of these sciences, should show 
the relation of the various parts of each study and of the several 
studies to each other; in short, should be a teaching 
knowledge of these branches. At present in many parts of 
our state there are not suitable opportunities for a teacher to 
gain even the academic instruction suggested above, to say 
nothing of professional training. Very few of our high 
schools and colleges even attempt it. There is at present 
some excuse for the teacher who enters the work with inadequate 
preparation, but if these summer normals were maintained, 
she would have no excuse for failing to improve her 
qualifications. Our rural schools are in session only from six 
to eight months, leaving their teachers time and strength to 
attend the summer schools. The county superintendent should 
insist that she do this each year until she could secure a fair 
preparation. In the absence of such permanent summer 
school sustained by the state, the best temporary substitute </seg>

            <seg id="p193">
159 


thus far tried is the Union Normal institute. Several counties 
by merging their funds and charging a small tuition are able 
to maintain an efficient summer school for several weeks. 
They can employ first-class instructors, take time to give a 
systematic, connected course in pedagogy of real value to the 
teachers, and accomplish definite results in academic work. A 
model primary school can be conducted and a first-class lecture 
course maintained. Something of this kind must be done if 
teachers are to secure any fair degree of preparation. I think 
it is apparent to all that the county institute of one or two 
weeks is totally inadequate to give even the professional instruction 
needed. The most that can reasonably be "xpected 
of them is, where teachers are already well prepared, to maintain 
the professional spirit and to enable them to keep up with 
the times. The work of the Union Normal schools last year 
was highly satisfactory. I believe the number will steadily 
increase and that they have come to stay until they are replaced 
by more permanent summer schools maintained by the 
state. J. F. Conner, Conductor, 

Superintendent Holdrege City Schools. 

IPhe fact is, that the institute at Holdrege was so far ahead 
anything that I have ever before seen that I have nothing 
th which to compare it. The summer schools in which I 
d previously worked, three of them, were in some cases very 
od, but did not compare with this. The ordinary institutes 
a not like it in kind or quality. 

There were two features that were particularly pleasing to 
me: one was the conductor, who managed things so well; the 
other was Chancellor Andrews, who was the most popular of 
the general lecturers. All our teaching force was good. Dr.. 
Red way took well after the first few times, and Dean Fordyce 
from the very start. 

I have not yet heard of any teachers who did not prefer the 
joint institute. The attendance record shows this beyond a 
doubt. Over two-thirds of the entire enrollment were there 
for the full term of five weeks. Many of the others who came 
for a shorter time expressed themselves as certain to attend 
the full time if they had another opportunity.

SUCCESS OF CULBERTSON INSTITUTE — RESOLUTIONS 

During the session resolutions were adopted by the teachers, 
to be presented to the state representative conventions asking 
them to instruct their nominees, in case of election, to work 
for the location of a state normal any where in the western 
part of the state where, in the judgment of the legislature, it 
would accommodate the interests of the state to the best advantage. 
(At the close of the sessions the following resolutions 
were adopted: ) 

Whereas, It now becomes necessary to dissolve this union 
normal institute and to sever our connection with these 
pleasant associations; and whereas we realize the institution 
has been a source of great profit to all concerned, and that the 
cause of education in Southwestern Nebraska has received an 
impetus that will be productive of renewed zeal and enthusiasm 
on the part of the teachers, of higher standards, nobler 
purposes, and greater progress for the schools; and 

f'hereas, We believe that the union normal institute, if coned 
in future years, will result in a stronger education and 
uplift of our profession to a higher plane, therefore be it 

Resolved, That in the endorsement of this measure we express 
our sincere appreciation to our loyal and energetic state 
superintendent, W. K. Fowler, Deputy J. L. McBrien and the 
county superintendents, Mrs. Clara L. Dobson, James O'Connell, 
Eugene Dutcher, G. H. Pickett and Mrs. Ida M. Kimberling, 
who have made this educational rally possible and to whom 
we intend to show our gratitude in increased devotion to the 
exalted profession in which we labor. 

Be it further resolved, that we extend our heartfelt thanks 
to our worthy instructors, Supts. A. O. Thomas, Geo. H. 
Thomas, Prin. W. R. Pate, Miss Louisa McDermott and Dean 
Qharles Fordyce, whose faithful labor, untiring energy, cordiality

FROM SUPERINTENDENTS 

I take pleasure in saying that I heartily endorse the union 
normal institute idea. After seeing the practical application 
of the idea at Culbertson, I am convinced that it is the way to 
serve the best interests of the teachers and our schools. The 
best talent can be commanded for instruction and lectures, 
The association of teachers from various counties in numbers, 
made possible by the union normal institute, is a valuable inspiration 
well worth being coveted by any progressive teacher. 

Eugene S. Dutcher, 

Superintendent Red Willow County. 

As we are in one of the unfortunate counties that has no 
high school, we very naturally look to the institute for needed 
help. This help we failed to receive in our two weeks' institute, 
as the instructors were unable to do much along an academic 
line in so short a time. There being no normal school 
within the reach of the teachers of Southwest Nebraska, we 
did the next best thing in our opinion that could be done and 
formed a union normal institute at Culbertson, consisting of 
Hayes, Hitchcock, Red Willow and Frontier counties. The result 
of this was all and more than we expected it could be. It met 
with some disfavor at first, but we succeeded in getting thirty, 
three of the forty-five teachers in this county to attend, and 
we are having immediate results. In all the schools I have 
visited thus far, teachers are doing much better work in primary 
reading and language. They have an end in view and </seg>

seem to work from principle rather than from form. The 
teachers and friends of education are asking for another union 
normal institute next year. 

G. H. Pickett, 

Superintendent Hayes County. 

The union summer normal was- an unqualified success, — financially 
and educationally, — educationally, both in academic 
instruction and professional training. The time proved of 
sufficient length for thorough and systematic review, and the 
model school, primary methods and pedagogy classes extending 
through the entire course gave a professional grasp and 
inspiration that could not possibly be acquired in the ordinary 
county institute. Then the lecture course was in itself a 
strong educational factor. The large audiences of teachers 
proved an inspiration to the lecturers and they gave their very 
best thought. A proof of the value of the school to our 
teachers is that practically all who entered early intending 
to remain but two o"r three weeks, remained the whole time ; 
while those who entered later freely expressed their sense of 
loss in not having entered earlier. In this part of the state 
where there are few educational advantages and none for 
professional training, the advantages of these union normal 
institutes, with longer term and the larger funds, are most 
valuable, — -far superior to the county institutes, — yet they do 
not and never can be made to supply the place of the systematic 
training of normal schools. Our hope is to have one of 
these established within our reach within the near future. 

James O'Connell, 

Superintendent Hitchcock County. 

The greater number of my teachers as well as myself feel 
that the Union Normal Institute was a grand success. — Mrs. 
Ida M. Kimberling, Superintendent Chase County.

ve it does not compare with the union normal for

I count the recent union normal institute at Culbertson an 
unquestioned success. I have talked with many of the teachers 
in attendance, and without exceptio n they have borne 
free witness to the help and inspiration it gave them, and 
have declared unqualifiedly in favor of continuing the plan. 
They say it marks a tremendous advance over the former 
arrangement. It affords them the opportunity they want for 
self-improvement, and their manifestations of enthusiasm 
lately shown attest their future willingness to support the 
idea. George H. Thomas. 

The greatest satisfaction prevailed on the part of all and 
frequent expressions were heard of the advantages of the 
union normal institutes. Teachers generally were able to 
accomplish more definite work and appreciated the opportunity 
for a thorough review or a chance to learn of subjects new to 
them. Teachers in this section of the state are situated so 
far from educational institutions that few have an opportunity 
to prepare thoroughly for the profession, yet nowhere in the 
state are found more enthusiastic or wide awake teachers. 
During the session resolutions were adopted by the teachers, 
to be presented to the state representative conventions asking 
them to instruct their nominees, in case of election, to work 
for the location of a state normal anywhere in the western 
part of the state where, in the judgment of the legislature it 
would accommodate the interests of the state to the best advantage. 
My experience in this Wurk convinces me that the 
union normal will stay. It holds many advantages over the 
old plan. Some of them are as follows : 

(1) It may be made academic as well as inspirational. 

(2) Instructors have an opportunity to exemplify methods 
in the presentation of subject matter. 

¦) The increased term gives confidence to both teachers 
instructors that definite results will be reached. </seg>

(4) The joining of funds enables the employment of a 
larger number of instructors, which will allow a more perfect 
classification of the members of the institute. 

Elt unifies the standards of education in the counties inted, 
bringing all counties up to the standard of the 
gest. 

B) It affords opportunity to organize a model school and to 
luct it with a greater degree of efficiency. 

I would recommend that no week be set auart as a special 
institute week, but that the entire time be made institute ; that 
the program as organized be carried through without interruption, 
and also that the session be four weeks, which will 
enable the work to be done either in June or August without 
infringing on the vacation month of July.

SIDNEY UNION NOKMAL INSTITUTE 

The Institute Normal held its closing session on Thursday, 
after six weeks of continuous and profitable work. That it 
was a decided success, was the unanimous sentiment of all 
in attendance. The total enrollment reached one hundred one. 
There were many disadvantages to contend with owing to the 
shortness of time in planning and arranging for the work. 
While it was but a project or venture, so to speak, yet its 
merit and success have been proven. — Sidney Telegraph.

FROM SUPERINTENDENTS 

Pve to the Sidney Normal Institute I desire to say that 
part of the state it was a great privilege to have such 
1 talent, both teachers and lecturers, so near us and at 
) expense. — Mrs. W. E. Heard, Superintendent Banner 

In my opinion the Union Normal Institute is what we need 
for western Nebraska. The teachers who attended from this 
county are beginners, and I feel that ten schools are being 
greatly benefited by the help given at the summer school at 
Sidney, which could have been received in no other way. — 
Agnes Lackey, Superintendent Scotts Bluff County. 

The work done in the Sidney Union Normal Institute was 
such as to convince me that, the union institute is the plan 
which should be adopted in this part of the state at least. The 
work here was very good, and I am heartily in favor of holding 
a similar institute the coming year if satisfactory arrangements 
can be made between three or four, or even more, counties 
— C. P. Chambers, Superintendent Chey nne County. 

I am sure that the Union Normal Institute is bv far better 
than the ordinary county institute. Our teachers were well 
pleased with the benefits derived from attending this year. I 
can see very plainly that the institute for the coming year 
should be similar to that of this. You may depend upon it, I 
am in favor of the Union Normal Institute. — Alice Wilkinson, 
Superintendent Kimball County. 

FROM INSTRUCTORS 

In my opinion the Union Normal Institute is of great value 
in the western counties. It is academic rather than professional 
work that should be given first, and the joint institute affords 
the best available means for giving this academic work. — E. </seg>

My opinion of the relative value of the Union Normal Institutes 
and the County Institutes is based on my observation as 
an instructor in the first Union Normal Institute held in the 
state and as conductor of the Union Normal Institute held at 
Sidney this year, together with an experience of several years 
as a worker in the County Institutes. Many of the counties of 
the state have a sufficient number of teachers with training in 
high schools and in higher schools so that each county may 
have a successful institute of one week, inspirational rather 
than for academic work. In a large number of the counties 
the conditions are such that there are many advantages in the 
Union Institute, if properly managed. Among the advantages 
may be named the larger fund available securing a longer term 
with competent instructors and good lecturers, which would 
not be the case if each county were to have its own institutes. 
Another advantage is the inspiration which comes with larger 
numbers and the association with a larger number of successful 
teachers. In many of the counties the longer term is very 
helpful in raising the scholarship of teachers. I believe that 
the teachers who have attended the Union Institutes have 
been pleased rather than dissatisfied with the plan of uniting.

COMMENDATORY 

The launching of the Union Normal Institutes the past summer 
constitutes in my judgment one of the longest steps forward 
in public school work which the history of the state has 
ever witnessed. I was present at a number of these institutes 
and was deeply impressed with the superiority of the new 
order over the old. The teaching was better and the interest 
on the part of hearers showed an even greater improvement 
I hope that the Union method will become general throughout 
the state It seems to me that a plan can be devised by which 
the Normal Scnool and the University might recognize as a 
basis for credit thorough work, duly vouched, done at these 
institutes. E. Benj. Andrews, 

Chancellor University of Nebraska. 

A practical experience in the county institutes of Nebraska 
during the past seventeen years has convinced the writer, 
first, that this institution may be a powerful factor in promoting 
the teaching character of our educators, and, atoomi, 
that it may prove little more than a waste of time, energy and 
public funds. The aim and end of the institute is to provide 
such academic and professional training as will make better 
teachers, and at the same time arouse an impulse in the direction 
of continued culture. The realization of this aim requires 
the replacement of incompetent instructors by teachers of 
high scholastic and technical acquirements, of exceptional skill, 
and of wide educational experience. There is need, also, of 
an extension of the period during which the summer training 
school is in session in order that more ample time may be 
afforded for needed academic instruction, and for the tendency 
to growth and improvement that comes from contact of teacher 
with instructors and with his fellows, and finally that more 
extended opportunity may be given for the demonstration of 
worthy methods. The results achieved by the Union Normal </seg>

Kjatest efficiency may be brought about by the merging 
energies and funds of several contiguous counties into 
itral, vigorous, inspiring summer training school. 

Charles Fordyce, 

Dean of College of Liberal Arts, 

Nebraska Wesleyan University. 

Ever since the Union Normal Institutes of Johnson and Ne 
maha counties were held at Tecumseb and Auburn in 1890 and 
1891, respectively, I have been in favor of the Union Normal 
Institute idea. Those were the best institutes ever held in 
that section of the state. I visited those held at Culbertson 
and Holdrege this year. The advantages of these institutes 
over the ordinary county institute were plainly evident. So 
marked was their success that I predict others will be organized 
the coming summer. I shall use my influence to that end, 
not only for the western counties bat for the eastern counties as 
well. Only a few counties have sufficient funds for a firstclass 
program and professional talent without combining with 
other counties. Let the good work go on. 

J. W. Crabtree, 

Inspector of High Schools, University of Nebraska. 

OBSTACLES 

Local pride in holding the institute in the home county and 
the political dictation of the bosses over the county superintendents 
are the principal obstacles to be overcome in establishing 
Union Normal Institutes. A fearless, progressive, common-sense 
sur&gt;erintendent will master the local pride delusion. 
By making the term of the county superintendent four years 
instead of two the selfishness of the politicians will, in a great 
measure, be defeated. 

The people of Culbertson, Holdrege and Sidney are human 
like the rest of us, and they were not entirely free from the 
temptation to charge unreasonable rates for board and lodging. 
McCook lost the Culbertson Union Normal Institute because 
of the high prices quoted on board and lodging. This is a 
question which must be reduced to a systematic basis with 
reasonable rates guaranteed. </seg>

IN CONCLUSION 

When we reflect over the work of these Union Normal Institutes 
grand results are evident. By comparing notes and exchanging 
thoughts, iron has sharpened iron. Progressive 
ideas on problems of education throughout these counties are 
being unified. These institutes have inaugurated thorough, 
systematic work, not only in the institutes, but in the schools 
as well. They have given the teachers who attended them 
many common sense methods, and filled their minds with high 
aspirations. Judging the future by the past, encouraged by 
the hearty approval of teachers, superintendents, instructors 
and educators, we have high hopes for the success of the 
Union Normal Institutes to be held in the future. These institutes 
mark a new epoch in the educational work of this 
great state. </seg>


            <seg id="p208">
Different men often see the same subject in different lights. 
But let us not becloud the public mind in the discussion of a 
question of such magnitude as the normal school question is 
to Nebraska. Flagrant inaccuracies and gross distortion of 
facts form the chief argument of those who oppose normal 
schools. Here is one of the false arguments : 

{In the discussion of normal schools some people forget the 
t that the original demand for such schools was caused by 
very inferior scholarship possessed by the average candie 
for the pedagogue's chair in this country. The great 
verslties were yet to be organized," etc. 

Such assertions are plainly without foundation. The founding 
of the great universities in this country antedates the establishment 
of normal schools more than two hundred years. 
The first college was founded in 1636, the general court of 
Massachusetts appropriating 400 pounds sterling for the purpose. 
In 1638 this college received the name of Harvard college, 
in honor of John Harvard, who gave to it his library and 
half his estate. In 1693 a charter was obtained from the king 
and queen to establish William aud Mary college in Virginia, 
the second in the colonies. Yale college was founded at Saybrook, 
Connecticut, in 1700. and before the French and Indian 
war three other colleges or universities were established which 
have since become Columbia, Princeton and the University of 
Pennsylvania. The first public agitation of the normal school 
question in this country was started by Charles Brooks, of 
Medford, Mass. In 1835 Mr. Brooks called a convention of 
the citizens of Plymouth, to whom he opened the whole matter 
as clearly and strongly as he could, showing that the great 
work must begin by founding a state normal school in 
Plymouth county. Many conventions were held, many 
speeches were made, many resolutions adopted. 

K t t one of these conventions Daniel Webster and John Quincy 
ims were present, and though both had attended under the 
dition that they were not to be called upon to speak, yet </seg>

THE NORMAL SCHOOL QUESTION. 

neither of them was able to refrain from giving expression to 
the feelings and sentiments which had been developed by contact 
with the enthusiastic leaders of the movement. 

Mr. Webster said he was anxious to concur with others in 
aid of the project. The ultimate aim was to elevate and improve 
the primary schools. If the town schools were no 
better than they were when he attended them, he was sure 
they were insufficient to the needs of the present day. This 
plan of a normal school is designed to elevate the common 
schools and thus carry out the noble ideas of our Pilgrim 
fathers. But there is a larger view yet. Every man and 
every woman, every brother and every sister is a teacher. 
Parents are eminently teachers. Now, if normal schools are 
to teach teachers, they make parents and all who in any way 
influence childhood more nearly competent to their high office. 
In families there will be better teaching, and the effect will be 
felt throughout society. 

Mr. Adams said : 

"The original settlers of New England were the first people 
on the face of the globe who undertook to say that all children 
should be educated. On this our democracy has been founded. 
Our town schools and town meetings have been our stronghold 
in this point, and our efforts now are to second the efforts of 
our pious ancestors. Some kingdoms of Europe have been 
justly praised for their patronage of elementary instruction, 
but they were only following our early example. Our old system 
has made us an enlightened people, and I feared that the 
normal school system was to subvert the old system, take the 
power from the towns and put it into the state, and overturn 
the old democratic principles of sustaining the schools by a 
tax on property ; but I am happy to find that such is not its 
aim or wish ; but on the contrary it is accordant to all the old 
maxims, and would elevate the town schools to the new wants 
of a growing community. We see monarchs expending vast 
sums to establish normal schools through their realms, and 
sparing no pains to convey knowledge and efficiency to all the 
children of their poorest subjects. Shall we be outdone by 
kings? Shall monarchs steal a march on republics in the 
patronage of that education on which a republic is based? On </seg>

this great and glorious cause let us spend freely, yes, more 
freely than on any other." 

The first state board of education of Massachusetts was established 
by a vote of the legislature, and was organized on 
the 29th of June, 1837, with Horace Mann as its secretary. 
The new board of education recommended, as was expected, 
the enactment of a law for the establishment of state normal 
schools. It is doubtful whether their recommendation would 
have been adopted had not a "deus ex macbina" descended for 
the occasion. Edmund Dwight proposed to the legislature 
that he would be responsible for $10,000 to aid in the establishment 
of teachers' seminaries, provided the legislature would 
give tb,e same amount for the same cause. On the 19th day of 
April, 1838, a marked day in the history of the United States, 
the legislature passed resolutions accepting the gift, and authorizing 
the governor to draw a warrant on the treasurer for 
$10,000 for the purpose specified in the resolutions. The 
board decided to establish three normal schools. The opening 
day for the first school came July 3, 1839. Assembled in the 
reception room of the normal building were the august visitors 
of the school, with the newly elected principal, and before 
them sat three timid girls — only three — to be examined and 
enrolled as the first pupils of the first state normal school in 
America. The first quarter closed with twelve students. In 
the fall a model school was conducted with thirty-three pupils. 

'O small beginnings, ye are great and strong, 
Based on a faithful heart and weariless brain 
Ye build the future fair, ye conquer wrong, 
Ye earn the crown, and wear it not in vain." 

In 1890 there were in the United States 135 public normal 
schools, with 1,183 instructors, 26,917 students and 4,413 
normal graduates. In 1900 there were 172 public normal 
schools, with 2,171 instructors, 47,421 normal students and 9,-072 
normal graduates. In 1890 the private normal schools 
numbered forty-three, with 274 instructors, 7,897 students, 824 
normal graduates. In 1900 there were 134 private normal 
schools, with 917 instructors, 22,172 normal students and 2,321 
normal graduates. </seg>

THE NORMAL SCHOOL QUESTION. 

These figures do not include the universities and* colleges 
having departments of pedagoey, and those offering courses 
for the training of teachers. When th*»se schools are considered 
it gives us for 1900 a grand total of 1,476 institutions in 
which 98,342 students received normal training. 

Ehe public appropriations to public normal schools in the 
ted States from 1889-90 to 1899 1900 inclusive— eleven years 
ere for buildings, 47,777,668, and for support $21,999,900, 
ring a grand total of nearly $30,000,000 for public normal 
x&gt;ls in eleven years. 

With two exceptions all the states and organized territories 


Ie public normal schools. Twelve states and territories 
port only one normal school each. Massachusetts has ten 
lie normal schools, Pennsylvania fifteen, New York six" 
i. Ohio has lately scored a signal triumph in the establish* 
it of two state normal schools. Iowa dedicated, onlv last 
r, one uf the most modern normal school buildings in the 
ted States. Kansas is liberal in her appropriations for 
great normal school at Emporia. And yet, in the face of 
steady growth of the public normal school we are told that 
ey were a temporary expedient," etc. If in 1838 this 
ntry appropriated but $10,000 to public normal schools, 
le in 1900 it appropriated $3,487,510. about 350 times the 
&gt;untof 1838, it seems to me that normal schools have become 
armanent fixture in the American system of education. 

An opponent of Normal schools says: "It is urged by some 
old fashioned people that there is something peculiar in the 
normal school to commend it beyond a well equipped university, 
because it teaches people how to teach other people while 
the university merely teaches people and stops there." 

We are apt to fancy, some of us, because we are growing old 
and are ourselves old-fashioned that everybody else is growing 
old and old-fashioned. But the oldest normal school in the 
country is relatively a babe in swaddling clothes, in comparison 
with the oldest American university. Is Ohio, after several 
years of fighting for normal schools, in this morning of the 
twentieth century, because she establishes two great public 
normal schools and is now the mother of presidents, to be 
laughed at as being among the old-fashioned states? </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

So far as the university fits fur teaching it does its work 
well. But it cannot furnish a sufficient number of teachers for 
the high schools alone. Of the 9,400 teachers employed in the 
public schools of this state every year, but 5.5 per cent are 
graduates of a college or university; but 40 per cent have a 
high school education or its equivalent; 29 per cent have no 
nigh school training, and less than 16 per cent have anything 
like professional training. It is evident, therefore, that you 
will rarely find a professionally trained teacher in the rural or 
country schools. 

The chief mission of the normal school is to prepare teachers 
for the rural or country schools and for the grades in town 
and city schools. It is the duty of the state superintendent to 
give special attention to the rural schools. It comes with poor 
grace for those of us who are fortunately situated and who can 
send our children to the best graded schools equipped with all 
the modern improvements and in charge of trained teachers 
directed by expert superintendents to advocate a policy which 
deprives the farmer boy and the farmer girl of all these matchless 
opportunities. Nebraska employs annually over 9,000 
teachers, but only 3,000 of this number teach in the graded 
schools of the state, including all cities and the villages, large 
and small, that employ two or more teachers. Fully 6,400 of 
our teachers are employed in the country, in isolated rural 
schools, and their pupils should receive some consideration. 
University graduates will not teach them. While it may not be 
possible to give all their pupils the advantages of the city 
school, by making adequate provision for the training of our 
teachers we can do much more than we are now doing in fitting 
these boys and girls for the duties of American citizenship. 
Let every child in the rural districts of this state be sent to a 
good school taught by a professionally trained teacher, broad 
in national ideas and opinions. If we do this, strength, peace, 
harmony, prosperity, nobility of character, patriotism, virtue 
and happiness will increase in the land. 

It has been charged by some of those who oppose normal 
schools that I am inclined to be quite technical in my discussion 
of the normal school question. But is it any more technical 
to call Harvard college a university, as early as 1839, 
than to call the first teachers' seminary, established in this </seg>

country at Lexington, Massachusetts. July 3, 1839. a normal 
school? Harvard college was two hundred years old then. 

One opponent of Normal schools asserts that ' ' it was the 
rise of Michigan University that forced these old-fashioned 
little sectarian colleges to get up and dust and become what 
they are today." Why ridicule the work of these colleges? 
"By their fruits ye shall know them." As early as 1723, Yale 
had among its professors the eloquent and profound Jonathan 
Edwards whom Robert Hall considered "the greatest of the 
sons of men." Timothy Dwight was elected its president in 
1795. Longfellow and Hawthorne graduated at Bowdoin in 
the class of 1825. Emerson and Holmes graduated at Harvard 
in 1821 and 1829 respectively. Jefferson entered William and 
Mary College in 1760. V* ebster graduated at Dartmouth in 1801 
and delivered his immortal reply to Hayne in 1830. All this — 
and it is not half the story — was accomplished before Michigan 
University was even established. Judged by the finished product, 
when have our great universities done better? Michigan 
University was established in 1837 at Ann Arbor. Did its rise 
do away with normal schools in that state? Not at all. The 
first Michigan state normal school was established in 1849 at 
Ypsilanti; the second at Mount Pleasant in 1895; and the 
third at Marquette in 1899. Remember that these last two 
normal schools were established in Michigan at a time when 
she counted her private academies, seminaries and colleges by 
the score and her modern, well-equipped high schools by the 
hundred ; yes, it was after the rise of Michigan University 
with its reputation world- wide; with its sixty-four acres, 
twenty-one buildings, superior equipment in every department 
and its total valuation of more than two million dollars; with 
its 138 professors and instructors; and more than 700 graduates 
annually sent out from a total enrollment of over 3,400 
students. 

Look at Wisconsin with her private schools, academies, 
seminaries and colleges. There are scores of them. Count 
her modern, well-equipped public high schools by the hundred. 
Do not forget her great university. Note also that she has 
seven great normal schools. No states in the Union surpass 
Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania in the number 
and efficiency of private schools, academies, seminaries, </seg>

colleges 'and universities. Tbeir public high schools are 
modern, well-equipped and abreast of the times in every respect. 
The University of Pennsylvania is one of the greatest 
schools in America. And besides all these, Massachusetts 
has ten public normal schools, New York sixteen and Pennsyl- 



' ' But in the face of the great onward of the normal 
6chcol idea there are some' who still oppose normal ' schools. 
Their minds are made up." I have no expectation of changing 
their opinion. I only want to show by the facts given herein 
what consummate old-fashioned people there must be in 
Michigan, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania. 
In the interest of the rural schools and the children 
of the 'great longing, struggling, hungering, needing, hoping, 
despairing and yet unyielding people therein, I would that 
Nebraska had mere old-fashioned people, if to desire normal 
schools, in which teachers may prepare to 'teach the children 
of these people, is old-fashioned. 

"^Were those who still oppose normal 'schools to go into the 
rural schools of central and western Nebraska, without a predecision 
of the question, and make a careful study of the actual 
conditions of thousands of these rural schools, they would 
be ardent advocates of more normal schools for Nebraska. 

'Tbe'whole nation is out for better teachers — great 
teachers. Exalt the rural or common schools by the exultation 
'of the teacher. We cannot do this without normal 
schools. Shall |we follow the example of the older, more 
experienced, more^progressive states and do this, or shall 
Nebraska wilfully entertain "an opinion of wisdom, gravity, 
and profound conceit" and declare to the world: "No normal 
schools here. They are old-fashioned. I am Sir Oracle !" 

Another objection to the establishment of normal schools by 
the state is that ' 'they do not give sufficient culture

for teachers in all but the most primary grades of our school

greatest American educator* since Horace Mann. I] quote 
from Colonel Parker's address on "The School of the Future" 
delivered before the National Educational Association, Toronto, 
Canada. *It will be observed that he entertained 
opinions of a character very opposite to those expressed by 
the person just quoted. In that address Colonel Parker said : 

"My fellow teachers, the day has now fully come when high 
grade professional training schools and colleges are an absolute 
necessity. The day has come when steps should be taken to 
see that no college or university graduate is ever allowed U 
take'upon himself^the sacred office of teacher without at least 
two^years' professional training in a school or college fully 
equipped for that purpose. Here lies the way of the future 
school. Exalt the common schools by the exaltation of the 
teacher. Make thoroughly educated men and women fully 
capable of taking the priceless treasures of truth, revealed in 
this mighty century, to the school-room, and putting them in 
the souls of the children. Make them capable of undertaking 
the problem of man and the destinies of humanity. Raise the 
teacher from the low conflict over petty methods and devices 
to the higher atmosphere of principles and laws. 

EOur interminable squabbles over this method or that device

would be Jifted where it belongs, to the head |of all pro-

out the destiny of this mighty continent, and through it of all 
humanity." 

No man of prominence has emphasized the value of normal 
instruction with better logic than the late J. Sterling Morton : 

I We demand for Nebraska educated educators. We demand 
fessionally trained teachers, men and women of irreproach! 
character and well-tested abilities. We demand from our 
slature laws raising the standard of the profession and 
Iting the office of the teacher. As the doctor of medicine 
he practitioner at law is only admitted within the pale of his 
ing upon the production of his parchment or certificates, so 
applicant for the position of instructor in our primary and 
sr schools should be required by law to first produce his 
loma, his authority to teach, from the normal schools. 

I 'We call no uneducated quack or charlatan to perform sur•y 
upon the bodies of our children lest they may be demed, 
crippled and maimed physically all their liven. Let 
take equal care that we intrust the development of the menfaculties 
to skilled instructors of magnanimous character 
A the mentalities of our children may not be mutilated, 
'ormed and crippled to halt and limp through all the centurof 
their never-ending lives. The deformed body will die, 
1 be forever put out of sight under the ground, but a mind 
de monstrous by bad teaching dies not, but stalks forever 
ong the ages, an immortal mockery of the divine image." 

Kmake the following recommendations relative to the norschool 
situation : 

Kst. Exchange the Industrial School for Boys at Kearney 
h the State Normal School at Peru. 

2d. Establish a new Normal School at Lincoln. 

3d. Provide for Junior Normal Schools at Alliance and Mc- 
Cook. 

4th. Recoenize more liberally the first-class private Normal 
Schools and denominational colleges of high standard. 

In support of my first recommendation, that is, an exchange 
of .the Kearney and the Peru institutions, I desire to call attention 
to the distance, lack of railroad facilities and the expense 
in reaching Peru as obstacles to a large attendance of students </seg>

THE NORMAL SCHOOL QUESTION. 

It seems almost incredible, and yet it must be true, unless 
our geographers are mistaken, th&lt;.t the distance, as the bird 
flies, from Benkelman to Peru is equal to the distance from 
Peru to Guthrie, Oklahoma ; from Kimball to Peru, the distance 
is equal to that from Peru to Little Rock, Arkansas; 
from Alliance to Peru, the distance is equal to that from Peru 
to Blooming ton, Illinois; from Broken Bow to Peru, the distance 
is equal to that from Peru to Sioux Palls, South Dakota; 
from Chadron to Peru, the distance is equal to that from Peru to 
Fargo, North Dakota. Or, if we swing the State of Nebraska 
around Peru as a pivot, the northwest corner of the state will 
touch Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Chicago, Illinois; Clinton, Kentucky; 
Tipton, Tennessee; and Denison, Texas. 

Students must of necessity make several trips to and from 
the state normal before they complete their course of study. 
These great distances, therefore, make their railroad fare alone 
a burdensome expense, while those who are committed to the 
industrial school are transported at the expense of the state, 
and remain there until they are twenty-one years old. Then, 
too, these juvenile offenders come mostly from the larger towns 
and cities in the eastern and southeastern portions of the state. 
Hence, the expense to the state for the maintenance of the industrial 
school would be no greater under the proposed transfer 
than it is at present. Both institutions could be converted 
to the new purposes here recommended with but little extra 
expense to the state. 

It is evident that a great normal school can never be built 
at Peru, because of its location. The attendance at Peru 
the years 1891-1892 was 456 and 435 respectively, an aver-3 
for both years of 445. The attendance for the school year 
11-1902, exclusive of the summer school, was exactly 440. 
e attendance at the present writing (November 1, 1902) is 
)ut an even 400. This is not what it should be, but it is 
&gt;ut all we can ever expect, owing to its location. I am consnt 
that if our state normal school were transferred to Kearr, 
and no others were established, that its attendance wuuld 
more than doubled within five years. 

In favor of my second recommendation, let me say that * 
normal school located at Lincoln would serve well the eastern 
half of the state. Lincoln is the logical place for a state nor- </seg>

Pool. It is the greatest railroad center in the state, 
e located the state library, the Carnegie (city) library, 
library, museum, laboratories and workshops of the 
ity of Nebraska. These offer opportunities to the stuit 
cannot be duplicated anywhere in the state. A norool 
located here would, within ten years, have an ate 
of 1,000 students, in addition to those who would at- 
Kearney, wore our present normal school transferred 

Irecoirmend the establishment of junior normal schools at 
ance and McCook. By a junior normal I mean a normal 
x&gt;l conducted at the expense of the state ten or twelve 
ks each year during the summer months, beginning about 
first of June and closing near the end of August. Four 
as here would equal one year at the state normal school, 
complete course in a junior normal would cover four 
as. Those who complete the full course, or four terms of 
weeks each, would be entitled to a junior normal certificate 
d for two years. But the certificate feature of the junior 
mal will be discussed further under the topic, "Teachers' 
.lifications and Teachers' Salaries." 

At first thought, it would seem that a normal school at 
Kearney would furnish ample opportunity for the entire western 
half of the state. Speak of Broken Bow, and a majority 
of the people think of it as being in the northwestern part of 
the state. As a matter of fact, it is 190 miles by rail from 
Broken Bow to Alliance, or eighteen miles farther than it is 
from Broken Bow to Lincoln. From Alliance to Kearney, via 
Sidney or Grand Island, it is about 300 miles. From Alliance 
to Mansfield, the last station on the Burlington in the northwestern 
corner of the state, it is eighty miles. It is seventyfive 
miles from Alliance south over the Burlington railroad to 
Sidney, on the Union Pacific. Alliance is the logical point for 
a junior normal that will give professional traiming to the 
teachers of at least fifteen counties. Sparsely settled counties, 
to be sure, yet it requires over 500 teachers for the schools of 
these counties. A junior normal at Alliance would enroll at 
least 250 teachers in a ten weeks' summer school each year. 
Likewise is McCook the logical place for a junior normal for 
at least eight counties in the southwestern part of the state. </seg>

            <seg id="p223">
183 

THE NORMAL SCHOOL QUESTION. 

It requires over 600 teachers for the schools of these eight 
counties. It is a conservative estimate to say that at least 300 
teachers would attend a summer term of ten weeks each year 
at McCook. These junior normals would aid materially in 
university and normal school extension even to the extreme 
limits of our western counties. No expense for buildings 
would be necessary for it is assumed that the boards of education 
at Alliance and McCook would tender the free use of their 
high school buildings for these schools. It would take not 
less than $8,000 for the biennium to provide competent instructor 
— $4,00" for each school. 

And while the state must be progressive in its plans, wisely 
liberal in its appropriations and prudent in its expenditures 
for normal schools, it must not discourage private and denominational 
schools, colleges and academies. There are such institutions 
in this state fraught with public good. The state 
should encourage them — not by public taxation or appropriations, 
but with the state's good will. By their works ye shall 
know them, and by their works they shall be judged. The 
legislature, in its wisdom and liberality, has already empowered 
the state superintendent to recognize such of these 
private institutions as maintain an equivalent of the University 
of Nebraska Teachers' course, or courses of study equal to the 
courses of the State Normal school, designating them as accredited 
schools. These recognitions carry with them the 
power to grant teachurs' certificates, some of which are good 
for two years, some for three years, and some for life. These 
private and denominational schools are doing good work. 
They will do still better work with proper encouragement. 
They are in no sense rivals of the State University or the 
State Normal school. 

I, therefore, recommend that Condition Second, Section 9, 
Subdivision IX, School Laws for 1901, be amended to read, 
"Fifty thousand dollars" instead of "One hundred thousand 
dollars." This would make it legal to recognize such educational 
institutions as those of Bellevue, Cotner, Creighton, 
Doane, Hastings, Grand Island, York, Wayne, and College 
View (Union), and perhaps others. 

f&gt;o not think I am reckless in my liberalism. I would have 
of these private and denominational institutions conform in </seg>

            <seg id="p225">
184 


their normal departments to a uniform course of study prescribed 
by the state superintendent. And before a certificate 
shall be granted to any person he should be required to pass a 
final examination on said course before a state board of examiners. 
The questions should be prepared by said board and 
the examinations conducted under strictly civil service rules. 


TEACHERS' QUALIFICATIONS AND TEACHERS' 
SALARIES 

FOR HIGH SCHOOLS 

The day is at hand when boards of education in cities and 
villages should require that all applicants for high school positions 
should be either normal school, college or university 
graduates, or holders of professional state certificates. We 
are glad to know that many boards of education are now 
demanding such qualifications. Teachers with these high 
qualifications can be secured if the people will pay salaries 
commensurate with such training. For example, permit me 
to call attention to the large number of persons possessing the 
requisite qualifications who responded to the government's 
call for teachers in the Philippine Islands. The qualifications 
demanded were as follows: (1) Applicants must be 
either normal school or college graduates; (2) must now be engaged 
in similar work or positions in the United States; (3) 
must be physically sound and able to withstand a tropical 
climate ; (4) must be willing to accept whatever positions 
are assigned; (5) must contract for three years; salaries, 
seventy-five to one hundred dollars a month, twelve months 
in the year unless otherwise advised, and transportation to 
Manila in case the time contract is completed. Only one 
thousand persons were needed for this work of the government, 
but five times that number answered the call. It follows 
that the same salary and tenure of office would secure teachers 
with like qualifications for our own high school pupils. 

FOR THE GRADES 

irhe time has also come when all boards of education in the 
vns and cities of Nebraska should require that all teachers 
the grades should possess at least a three-year high school 
tication and one year's normal school training. On such 
aparation certificates should be granted good for five years 
d thereafter renewable for five year periods if the holder </seg>

            <seg id="p226">
186 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

thereof has had at least three years' successful experience 
under the certificate. Regular attendance upon normal school, 
college or university should receive the same credit in the 
renewal of these certificates as though the time were devoted 
to actual work in teaching. Said certificates should be valid 
for any and all grades below the high school in each and 
every county in the state. 

Again, an with the high schools, money will vecure such teachers. 

FOR THE COUNTRY SCHOOLS 

While much more could be said on the qualifications of teachers 
for the high schools and the grades, I shall at this time 
deal principally with the qualifications of teachers for the 
country schools. In matters of education the problem of the 
rural school is second to none of the great problems before the 
American people. The most essential factor in the solution of 
the rural school problem is the teacher. And I believe that after 
September, 1907, no person should be licensed to teach in the 
rural schools of Nebraska who does not possess as the minimum 
qualification a thorough knowledge of the common 
English branches such as would admit to the average high 
school, and also one year's drill in a teachers' training class. 
These demands are as high as conditions will warrant. The 
reason why I do not include in the qualifications of teachers 
for the rural schools the same qualifications that I do for the 
town and city schools is not because the country boys and 
girls do not need and are not entitled to as thoroughly qualified 
teachers as their city cousins have, but because it is practically 
impossible to impose these high requirements on the village 
and rural communities. But to secure even these minimum 
qualifications the people in the rural communities must loosen 
their purse strings, for it will take money. The teachers stand 
ready to meet these qualifications when there is a tenure of 
office and a salary guaranteed which will warrant such preparation, 
as the following resolution passed by the Pillmore 
county teachers' institute in August, 1902, amply proves: 
"Resolved, That we stand for the merit system in the employment 
of teachers as well as for a longer tenure of office ; that we 
pledge ourselves to professional preparation, and that as a 
matter of simple justice we demand wages commensurate with 
OUf-Ll tz^)aL tX L1U11. </seg>

            <seg id="p227">
TEACHERS' QUALIFICATIONS AND SALARIES. 

187 

The Hod. Henry Sabin hits the nail squarely on the head 
when he says: "The thing which appals me very greatly in 
this rural school business is the utter and absolute and astonishing 
deadness of the rural school people to the condition 
of their schools. Until we contrive some way to arouse a 
better public sentiment, our labors will not be productive of 
the best results. The people will get just what they demand. 
Unless they can be made to demand something better than 
they are getting now, the legislature is not going to give it 
to us. A two years' normal school course for teachers of the 
country schools ought to be sufficient preparation for the 
needs of today. I do not believe, however, that the majority 
of our teachers could go to such a school without a better preparation 
than they have now in the common English branches. 
Give them a sound, fundamental education and then even one 
year's tuition under competent teachers would help them 
amazingly. It ought to be so arranged that two years will satisfy 
the wants of the community. As long as wages are as low 
as they now are and the tenure of office is so short and uncertain, 
the rural school teacher can hardly afford to spend more 
than two years in her preparation." 

THE TRAINING CLASS 

I would recommend the organization of training classes in 
colleges, normal schools, and such academies and high schools 
as are able to meet the requirements for such a class. These 
training classes should be under the unrestricted supervision 
of the state superintendent of public instruction. On or before 
the first of July each year, application for appointment 
to instruct training classes should be presented to the state 
superinteudent by the trustees of the institution desiring such 
appointment on blank forms provided for the purpose. No 
high school should be recognized as meeting the requirements 
for a training class except those organized under subdivision 
XIV or XVII of the school laws of Nebraska. These applications 
should set forth various facts or information regarding 
the school, giving the number of teachers employed, the enrollment 
in the different departments, opportunities afforded 
for observation and practice work, the names, qualifications 
and salaries of instructors, etc. Before being forwarded the </seg>

            <seg id="p228">
188 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S KEPOBT. 

application should be approved by the county superintendent 
of the county in which such school is located. The idea of 
permanency is an important factor to be considered in the 
approval of such schools, for it is essential to retain as far as 
possible the same institutions year after year and make them 
educational centers for this work. Certain specific requirements 
should be prescribed in the regulations issued by the 
state superintendent as a requisite for approving these institutions, 
among which are the following : the institution must 
furnish as an instructor (or instructors) a, college graduate or a 
normal school graduate with three years' experience in teaching 
since graduation, or the holder of a state certificate with 
three years' experience in teaching; all instructors of such 
classes must be approved by the state superintendent; a 
minimum salary of 9500 must be paid instructors ; the school 
must provide opportunity for the members of the class to 
observe methods of teaching in the several grades of common 
school work and to teach in such grades under proper supervision; 
it must conduct prescribed recitations in the subjects 
belonging to the training class course separate from all other 
recitations; and it must maintain a legal class, that is, a class 
of not less than ten nor more than twenty-five members for 
each instructor for at least thirty-six weeks in the year. 

ADMISSION TO TRAINING CLASS 

I Candidates for admission to the training class should possess 
&amp; minimum qualification a certificate of graduation from the 
hth grade. They should be at least sixteen years of age 
the time of entrance. They should also subscribe in good 
bh to the following declaration: "We, the undersigned, 
¦eby declare that our object in asking admission to the 
ining class is to prepare ourselves for teaching, and it is our 
-pose to engage in teaching in the rural schools of Nebrasat 
the completion of such preparation. We pledge ourves 
to remain in the class during the year unless prevented 
illness or excused by the state superintendent of public 
truction."

The work in all subjects in this course, save the

principles and methods of teaching. In reviewing them as 
subject matter it is the special aim to take them up from tbe 
standpoint of the teacher as a teacher rather than of the 
teacher as a student ; to approach them from the science side 
instead of the art side. 

THE EXAMINATION 

I it tbe close of each semester an examination should be subted 
by the state superintendent in all subjects included in 
course of study. The question papers should be prepared 
an examining board as follows : each member of said board 
assigned certain subjects in which he is to prepare quesis, 
to be presented to each of the other members of the 
&gt;rd for acceptance, modification or rejection ; an objection 
any two members of such board will be sufficient to reject 
question; after a sufficient number of questions are so acited 
they are copied and then read by each member of the 
urd, who indicates any further objection he may discover, 

ad then endorses the paper with his signature; the questions 
are again copied and presented to the state superintendent for 
his acceptance ; they are then ready for printing and distribution. 
Question papers and other supplies are forwarded to the 
county superintendent, who will conduct the examination for 
his own county in accordance with uniform regulations issued 

y the state superir tendent, and return the answer papers to 
ne chairman of the examining board for examination and 
ating by said board. These examinations are to be conducted 

on strictly civil service rules. Persons who attain a standing </seg>

of seventy-five per cent in all subjects are entitled to receive a 
training class certificate valid for three years and thereafter 
renewable for five periods (years) if the holder has had at 
least two years' successful experience under said certificates; 
said certificates to be good only in the rural schools of this 
state ; said certificates also to be valid in and for any county in 
this state upon registration by the county superintendent of 
the county in which the holder thereof may teach. Regular 
attendance upon high school, normal school or college shall 
receive the same credit in the renewal of these certificates as 
though the time were devoted to actual work in teaching. 

SUPERVISION 

Four agencies should be employed in supervision : examinations, 
visitation by department inspectors or examiners, visitation 
by the state superintendent or his deputy and visitation 
by county superintendents. The examinations have already 
been described as a final test of proficiency. They are also an 
important means of supervision. It should be made the aim 
to make the questions suggestive and directive — teaching 
questions as well as test questions. 

TRAINED EXAMINERS 

In the examination and rating of answer papers great care 
should be exercised to make the answers a means of determining 
the character of the instruction which a class has received. 
The answers of different classes will show contrasts, reflect 
alike excellencies and defects. The examiners, who should 
be teachers of experience and under permanent employment, 
should be required to submit in writing a critical report of the 
papers examined, school by school, class by class. The head 
of the school should have official notification from them of any 
marked excellency or defect of his class or of his instruction 
as indicated by the answers. The examiners should be required 
to devote at least two weeks at the end of each semester 
to the examination of answer papers for two reasons : to 
familiarize themselves with the character of the work as evidenced 
by the examinations and thus be able to re-enforce or 
modify the impressions gained regarding the general condition 
and'status of the work from their previous visits of inspection </seg>

            <seg id="p233">
TEACHERS' QUALIFICATIONS AND SALARIES. 

191 

and to discover what special features need to receive increased 
attention ; to afford them an opportunity to read the answers 
to their own questions, which is the best kind of training for 
future question making. After all papers have been corrected 
the examiners should send a circular letter to the instructors 
of training classes containing general criticisms or suggestions, 
also a table of the results, showing subject by subject 
the total number of papers submitted, the total number of 
papers accepted, the total number graded ninety per cent or 
above, the total number below sixty per cent and the percentage 
of accepted papers. At least once every term each training 
class should be visited by a representative of the state 
superintendent, who should submit a written report of the 
class, covering the following points: Membership, attendance, 
average and appearance of members, credentials of admission, 
room and equipment, names and qualifications of instructor 
or instructors, character of instruction both in subject 
matter and professional, observation and practice work. 

The demand for uniform examinations is imperative. The 
diversity of standards as obtained from the various teachers' 
certificates in the state make a preplexing situation. A first 
grade certificate in one county may not be the equal of a second 
grade certificate in another county. The same is also 
true of city certificates. If all examinations were conducted 
in accordance with civil service rules before a board of examiners, 
whose integrity, intelligence and fairness were above 
reproach, then a certificate would mean something in every 
district in the state and should pass at par throughout the 
state. I would, therefore, delegate all examinations for teachers' 
certificates to this state board of examiners, who should 
hold their positions under a tenure of office the same as the 
instructors in the state university, and they should be appointed 
by the chancellor of the state university, the inspector 
of accredited high schools and the state superintend - 

THE MISSION OF THE TRAINING CLASS 

Ebe special mission of the training class is to provide the 
il schools, that are not in a position to engage normal 
luates, with teachers who are proficient in the common </seg>

            <seg id="p234">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

branches and have devoted at least a year to special preparatio 
— largely in professional work. The province of the normal 
school and the province of the training class are, therefore, 
clear and distinct. The two are supplementary agencies 
and are not to be regarded in any sense as rivals. I am of the 
opinion that manv training class graduates after teaching a 
few years will be enabled to complete a course of study in a 
normal school, a step impracticable before they gain a foothold 
from the training class. The normal school proper cannot 
supply the demand for teachers in the country districts. 
Moreover, the graduate from the advanced normal course is, 
as a rule, beyond their reach, owing to the financial condition 
of a large majority of the rural school districts. The training 
class is the only means of providing trained teachers for the 
country schools. 

B desire to make acknowledgment to the inspector of trainclasses 
for the state of New York fc this argument in 
or of such classes ; and in further support of this plan, I 
take the following from the Report of the Committee of 
Twelve on Rural Schools : 

It is evident that for the fitting preparation of teachers for 
the rural school some agency is needed intermediate between 
the brief convention or institute and the normal school, with 
its two or four-years' course, so far beyond the reach of the 
majority of rural school teachers. What shall it be? 

Several facts must be kept in mind in the solution of the 
problem: (1) A large proportion of the teachers of rural 
schools cannot afford the time and expense of a two-years' 
course in a normal school. (2) The receipts from employment 
in the rural school under present conditions do not remunerate 
one for the expense of a normal-school course. This is a simple 
matter of business, and sentiment will not change the facts. 
(3) Other conditions remaining the same, attendance at a 
school is in an inverse ratio to the distance between school 
and home. This is especially true for a short course. 

To meet these conditions there is needed a normal training 
school with a short course of study. The place — a village 
which will give over its schools to this normal training school 
for practice schools. These practice schools, organized as 
primary schools in one room and as grammar schools in an- </seg>

193 

other, will show what can be done with schools in the simplest 
form of gradation. For a part of the course all the grades 
should be brought together to illustrate the work of the oneteacher 
school, such work as should be done in the ungraded 
school. A faculty of five or six good teachers, including practice-school 
teachers, would suffice for such a school. 

This the general organization — what the work? Treatment 
of matter essential to good teaching would be grounded on 
simple fundamental principles. Deficiencies in education 
rid be supplemented by sound teaching; principles of teachandof 
school management would be taught and illustrated. 
Many might learn to do well what they had never done at all; 
most would learn to do better what they had done poorly. 
From these schools would come many students for fuller 
courses of training and a still wider usefulness. 

This plan in its development would give a system of district 
training schools, analogous to the county model schools of 
Ontario, and the training schools of Quebec and Manitoba, 
with a course of study and training of one year, the first half 
of which should be mainly academic for those who need this 
preparation, the second half mainly professional, the work 
so planned that those of more advanced scholarship need take 
only the course of the second half year. Of these schools 
there should be at least one in every county of the state. 

The practice in teaching should be thoroughly organized. 
Every teacher in the school should be. in a certain sense, a 
training teacher ; he should be responsible for the methods of 
teaching in his own subjects, and should direct lessons given 
by members of his classes to children from the model training 
schools. Besides such lessons, illustrative of methods of 
teaching, the pupil-teacher should be trained in conducting 
school work in the schoolrooms, under conditions similar to 
those which she will find in her own school. While teaching 
in the practice school under the direction of a teacher in 
charge, she should be left more and more to her own judgment; 
she should be held responsible for the control and 
direction of the school, and for the teaching of a class, not 
merely of a group. The membership of the class for training 
should be limited to such numbers as will give the full 
advantage of the training course, or, with a practice school of 
the size presupposed, to about twenty-five. A large class 
necessitates the teaching of groups, not of full classes with the 
control of the school. The French law limits the number of 
students in each normal school to three classes of twenty-five

normal school has cost thousands, in some cases hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, and for two or three months in the 
summer this investment remains entirely unproductive. 
The success of the summer term in The University of Chicago 
is significant, and the Winona plan, adopted this year in all the 
state normal schools of Minnesota, sets the example for the 
nation. In normal schools the work of the first year — or the first 
part of the course — should be so planned as to have a unity in 
itself as a preparation for rural school teachers, and the results 
accomplished in the summer term should count on this course, 
so as to encourage subsequent attendance at the normal school. 
The summer term should not be an institute nor a summer 
school, in the usual sense, but should combine the elements of 
the other terms of the year; the attendance of children in the 
training school could be secured easily for two or three hours 
ft dsv 

There should be organized in all states a system of normalschool 
extension analogous to the university extension. 
Wherever a class of sufficient size can be formed, a teacher 
should be provided. The work should be so organized and 
conducted as to lead to definite results which can be credited 
to the members of the class. 

There are two possible agencies in the preparation of teachers 
for rural schools that have not been mentioned : 

1. City Training Schools. — In large cities it is not to be expected 
that the city training school will prepare teachers for 
rural schools; all their graduates usually find employment at 
home. But cities in this country with a population of more 
than 50,000 are comparatively very few, and it is reasonable to 
suppose that training schools in cities of less than 50,000 will </seg>

TEACHERS' QUALIFICATIONS AND SALARIES.

fjare more teachers than can be provided with employment 
lose cities. The surplus will naturally seek positions in 
village and country schools. 

Birmingham, Ala., a city of about 50,000, has had a training 
school for eight years. During that time'25 per cent of the 
graduates of this school have found employment in the ungraded 
schools of the county and state. If the training school 
is encouraged, it can be made an important factor in the preparation 
of teachers for rural schools. A part of the course 
in these schools* should, therefore, deal with the conditions 
of the ungraded schools of the country, and the instruction 
should be specifically adapted to meet those conditions. 

I Agricultural Colleges. — Many pupils in agricultural 
x&gt;ls and colleges teach during their course. In some cases 
agricultural college is brought nearer the people by the 
blishment of branches. Thus in Alabama there has been 
blished in each congressional district a branch agriural 
school, closely related to the agricultural and mechancollege 
of the state. Cannot such schools accomplish 
h in the specific preparation of teachers for the work of 
rural schools? 

3. High Schools. — An effective auxiliary in the training of 
elementary teachers may be found in high schools. In 1894-95 
there were in New York 247 such classes, with 2,482 
students. The regulations prescribe the professional qualifications 
of the teachers who are to instruct these classes, and 
the equipment and the opportunities for observation and practice 
to be furnished. The course of study, extending through 
one year, covers the ground of common-school studies, including 
with subject-matter the treatment of methods of teaching, 
the history of education, school management, and school 
law. The school is to furnish each day the opportunity for 
the class, or some members of it, to observe methods of teaching 
in the several grades of common-school work, and, when 
practicable, the opportunity to teach in such grades under 
proper criticism and direction. 

A system similar to this is in operation in the province of 
Quebec. 

filthough these training classes cannot take'the place nor 
the work of special training schools, yet they offer a ready </seg>

means for effecting some immediate improvement in the teaching 
force of the state, and for the selection of those who have 
such fitness for teaching as will justify their pursuing a 
special professional course. The teachers of such classes 
mast themselves have received thorough pedagogical instruction, 
else the result must be a failure ; hence the necessity is 
apparent for pedagogical courses in all colleges. 

Erne and space will not permit me to go further into details 
lis question, but I shall urge the next legislature to enact 
laws as will ultimately lead us to the high plane of these 
mmendations. </seg>

THE SCARCITY OF TEACHERS 

September 22, 1902. 

Ilince the beginning of the institute season it has been 
irly evident that the supply of teachers for the schools of 
braska would not, as in former years, exceed the demand. 
a prospects for a bountiful crop of all kinds of grain were 
ely equalled and never excelled in the state, and it was 
ly apparent that the gathering of this crop would withdraw 
m the ranks of teachers not only young men but married 
a and women, and also that its proceeds would obviate the 
:essity of many farmers' girls teaching school, and would 
urally increase the attendance in the higher educational 
titutions. 

The attendance at the teachers' county institutes held in 
June, 1902, was so light that many county superintendents 
who had hoped to raise the standard of the excellence of their 
schools and of their teachers' preparation for the work, were 
face to face with this dilemma: either to license — to certificate 
— all who applied, without regard to qualifications, or to leave 
some of their schools without teachers, thereby compelling 
them to close. Probably more third grade certificates have 
been issued than ever before. 

Saturday, September 6, 1902, the following questions were 
asked of the ninety county superintendents of Nebraska, and 
during the fortnight ending September 20, answers in accordance 
with the table following the questions were received. Undoubtedly 
many of the schools that were not supplied two 
weeks ago are now in session. 

1. Does the supply of teachers in your county at present 
equal (eq), exceed (ex), or fall short (sh) of the demand? 

2. Are all your schools supplied? 

3. How many are not? 

4. Shall I give your name to "anxious inquirers" for positions? 


5. What salary may they expect? </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

low as $25 a month, while in Cherry county no district has 
employed a teacher this year for less than $30, and salaries 
range from that to $50, and in Scotts Bluff county on the 
Colorado line some districts are also paying $50 a month. In 
Butler county also several rural districts pay $50 a month. 

One county superintendent reports that the scarcity of 
teachers is occasioned by the young people obtaining other 
employment at better wages. Cherry, Cheyenne and Red 
Willow counties want men teachers only. In Keya Paha 
county board may be obtained for from $1.50 to $2.00 a week. 
One county superintendent says: "I cannot be too strict or I 
would not have teachers enough for the schools, and it i» 
almost impossible to improve salaries with so large a percentage 
of beginners." Another remarks: "When compared with 
that of other vocations the teacher's compensation is scarcely 
enough to induce her to remain in the business — I cannot call 
teaching a profession. Do nut refer 'anxious inquirers' to me. 
I am afraid of them. I will write to Peru." Another one 
says : ' 'Considering the tax levies and the wages paid, the 
public ought to have known two or three years ago that the 
present condition would come about." Another county superintendent 
writes: "We have lost five of our men teachers who 
become mail carriers, two to study medicine, and four to farm 
or enter business. " And another: "Five of our rural school 
teachers will attend school, five were elected in graded schools, 
eight men and six women are earning more in other work, and 
seven (women) were married; eighteen will teach in other 
counties; total loss forty-nine. I will issue third grade certificates, 
the first of the kind in ten years. " Nearly every superintendent 
writes: "I haven't enough experienced teachers to 
supply the demand, by far." One superintendent said he was 
short fifty experienced teachers. McPherson county has 
secured (September 22) only two of her ten teachers. From 
Banner county: "Salaries from five to ten dollars higher. 
So far this year no twenty-five dollar teachers." (Higher, of 
course.) One superintendent writes : "Just enough teachers. 
Old teachers demanded better salaries and usually got them." 
Another superintendent says: "Have not been strict. Was 
compelled to furnish teachers for our schools and at the 
wages paid could not import." Another superintendent met </seg>
