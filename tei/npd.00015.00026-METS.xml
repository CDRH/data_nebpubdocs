HAY WITH AND WITHOUT GRAIN FOR CALVES. t&gt;uring the winter of 1902, twelve Aberdeen-Angus steer fed, in an experiment to determine whether or a small grain allowance added to a ration consisting of Ifa an&lt;l prairie hay would prove a more economical hod of wintering. The i f this test were pub - ed in Bulletin 75 issued by this station. Six of these calves received no grain, while the other six of the same quality received 4 pounds per day, consisting of torn, oats, and bran, in addition to hay. The hay for 1 rn— i«trd of 80 per cent alfalfa and 20 per cent prairie I Miring the winter j&gt;eriod, from January to April, those ?iving 4 pounds grain per day made an avei n of pounds per month, while those fed hay alone gained 33 tnds per month. Figuring all foodstuffs at market prices, vas found that the gains on grain and hay cost $4.6(5 per ldred pounds, while the gains on hay alone cost ffi jmt idled, a striking difference in favor of grain with hay for iter feeding. t&gt;uring the following summer, while on the same pasture, without grain, the winter grain-fed calves made an aver - gain of 60 pounds each less than the thinner, no-grain res, which put the latter behind only 20 pounds each at end of the entire period, October :&gt;(), 15)02. The grain calves, however, were appraised 2."&gt; cents per hundred ve the hay-fed calves, showing them to have been • it better in quality even at the later date. BOLL. 85, AGB. EXP.

Ki order to get further data upon the relative economy of with and without grain, the experiment was repeated ng the winter of 1903 upon a more extended scale. In this test, fifty grade Hereford steer calves were at which were purchased from the Nebraska Land &amp; Feeding in western Nebraska. These calves were remarkably n in size, condition, and quality, a matter of great impor - ts in comparing different rations. The fifty steers were divided into three lots with twenty in Lot 1, fifteen in Lot 2, and fifteen in Lot 3. The steers in Lot 1 received an average of about 6 pounds of grain each per day, in addition to alfalfa and prairie hay. Those in 2 received a light grain ration, 3 pounds each per day, in addition to alfalfa and prairie hay, and Lot 3 alfalfa ami prairie hay only. The two lots receiving grain were given a mixture con - sisting of 45 per cent corn, 23 per cent bran, 23 per cent oats, and 9 per cent oil-meal.

These figures are based upon the assumption that a &gt; from one lot consumed M much grass as one from another As a matter of fact the steers which had no grain the ions winter in all probability consumed somewhat more grass. Even so it would make the cost of gains in Lot 3 but little more, because of the cheapness of gra- r.rsioxs. Eis experiment would indicate that the cost of y gains in calves during the winter is least when consii' e grain is fed along with hay. The results during tlw t preceding were also found to be more favorable for Heeding from the standpoint of economical production. For the entire year, with no grain (hiring the summer while on grass, the results would go to show that a moderate grain ration in winter, not more than one-third a full feed, along with hay, is most economical. lives which have been full grain-fed during the winter are certain to lose a part of their grain flesh when pi. reen grass without grain. On the other hand, wintering without grain of any kind and allowing calves to run down in flesh and lose weight and vitality is not economical. A small grain ration added to hay or stalks or both keeps the digestive tract in better condition and products enoutrli bet - .rains to pay a good price for the grain fed, while it &lt;loes en from eating roughness in considerable quantity, a factor of importance in the economical produc - tion of beef. </seg>

During past years farmers have depended all rely upon corn for fattening, paying little heed to qual - of roughness to accompany it.

The work undertaken in this experiment was to show how it is possible to make corn go further in producing meat by supplying a protein-rich roughness, like alfalfa, in place of prairie hay; or, if prairie hay. corn-stalks, or sorghum are more available than alfalfa or clover, how a better gain can be secured by introducing with such roughness a concen - trated protein food like oil-meal (linseed-meal) to make a better balanced ration. OF THE EXPERIMENT. I he three lots of yearling Hereford steers, fifty in num - used as calves in a preceding experiment, were divided five lots, ten in each lot. Each of the five lots contained 1 steers taken from the lot of twenty which was given heaviest grain ration the preceding winter, three from lot of fifteen which was given a medium grain ration, three from the lot which had no grain the previous win- Tbis was done to make the five lots uniform in condi - . They were all in good grass flesh at the beginning of experiment, having been on good pasture all of the pre - ng summer. Ilach lot of steers had the run of a shed open on the south I and a yard adjoining. Every effort was made to place ial lots under uniform conditions to make records saeh lot comparable and as conclusive as is possible in a jle experiment. The feeding was done by Mr. Axel Strat - during the first part of the experiment and by Mr. Dale in the last four months. Both are graduates of the ool of Agriculture and were very painstaking in keeping irate weights of both steers and feed. To avoid uneven weights due to fill, the steers at the be - ginning were weighed four &lt;lays in si n and the aver- </seg>

These prices are too big]) for farm conditions, but were the prices prevailing at Lincoln Corn, (50 cent* jht 100 pound! (33 cents per bushel). Oil-meal, ?25 per ton. Alfalfa hay, $6 i&gt;er ton. Prairie hay, |6 per ton. Corn stover, $2.. r &gt;0 \w ton. At these prices, KM) pounds of gain by lot cost ;is foil Lot 1, corn and prairie hay, #S.27 Lot 2. corn, prairie hay, and oil-meal, v Lot 3, corn and alfalfa, $6.04. Lot 4, corn, corn stover, and oil-meal, fti.09. Lot .", corn, sorghum, and oil-meal, f7. Eliis shows that at the prices stated tl of gain - i and prairie hay without oil-meal was 21 per cent more l with oil-meal, and that the cost of gains on corn and rie hay was 36 per cent more than on corn and alfalfa. The cost of gains alw ins large at first sight I he advance in prices is not considered. The financial &gt; meni shows both cost and selling price of the cattle, profits being due to this advance in price per hundred on the initial weight. I he steers in all lots were started on 8 pounds of grain l per day with all the hay they would consume. As the eriment proceeded, the grain ration was gradually in - ised and the hay diminished. All lots were on a full in feed at the end of two months. May 14 the oil-meal ch had previously amounted to 10 per cent of the grain on on Lots 2, 4, and 5 was increased to LS per cent, mak - the mixture 85 pounds of corn to 15 pounds of oil-meal, oil-meal used was in the form of coarsely ground oil p. the particles being about the size of corn kernels.

The pork produced ucluded in the financial statement. |)uring the latter part of the experiment all lots were en all the grain they would clean up at. each feed, night I morning. As is indicated by the table, Lot 1 consumed ; grain. This was because they were fed an unbalanced ion and would not take as much grain as the other lots, very noticeable during the full feeding that I ?rs receiving oiUneal were always more eager to ?n Lot 3, which received alfalfa and corn, a well-ba)au&lt; »d ion. did not show quite the eagerness for grain that was wn by Lots 2, 4, and 5 on oil-meal. This was especially e during the last few weeks. Referring to the table it will be seen that Lot 3, the alfalfa uade the largest daily gain, while the lot receiving ( Min-stalks was a close second. Lot 3 also required the 1 grain for a given increase in weight, Lot 4 on corn stalks was second best in this respect, Lot 2 on prairie hay third. B on sorghum fourth, and Lot 1 on corn and prairie hay The poor showing made by Lot 1 on corn and prairie hay without oil-meal is one of the striking facts brought out by this experiment. It is the ration most commonly fed in ~ka. It is not a suitable ration because both corn and prairie hay are rich in carbohydrates (starches, etc. i but deficient in protein, the constituent which goes to produce ]« :m tissue. I Then compared with the gains secured by adding 10 per t oil-meal to the corn, it is evident that something n&gt; • to make good gains was supplied by the oil-meal which not present in the corn and prairie hay. The gains on l and prairie hay were 24fi pounds per steer, while the is on corn and oil-meal and prairie bay were 347 pounds steer. Seventeen pound* of food were consumed for one nd of gain on corn and prairie hay. and only 12.7 poundM e required where oil-meal was added to the ration. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 Field cured corn-stalks fed with corn and a little oil-meal give large and cheap gains, emphasizing the importance of harvesting the stalks for winter feeding unless wild ha cheap. In this lot the cost of gains was nearly as low as on alfalfa. Had the corn been fed on the stalk supple - mented with some grain mixed with oil-meal, the cost we a been still lower. Such a method was not possible in the experiment because then the amount of grain fed could not have been determined accurately. It has been found that cattle need something like pound of protein to seven or eight pounds of carbohydr for best growth. The last column of the table sh«' the ration fed Lot 1 has one |M)iind of protein to 10.4 pounds of carbohydrates, entirely too much starchy matter for the protein it contains. Alfalfa, like clover, is a plant rich in protein. Alfalfa and corn make a balanced ration without the addition of oil-meal. As fed in this experiment the nutritive ratio or proportion of protein to earbohydrat I : 7. Lot 4 on corn stover, corn, and oil-meal with a nutritive ratio of 1 pave gains almost as good. In view of the fact that the - or lower part of stalk was refused, it is probably true that the nutritive ratio of the food actuallv consumed was s. thing less than 1 : 8.3, since the leaf of the stalk is rii protein. It should be stated that the stalks fed cont;i no ears whatever. The corn was cut just as soon as the ears were hard enough to harvest without shrinkage. The was cut and shocked at the earliest possible date for the corn to mature. After standing three weeks in the field it placed in very large shocks and husked and Ixuind in bun - dles in early winter. The stalks were fed from the bundles in the shock until the heavy spring rains made it desirable to put them under shelter. They were weighed and pi. uncut in racks each day. Not until the last month, when the crop of whole stalks was used up, were shredded s&gt; substituted. The sorghum was sown thick with a drill and i ut with a mower after some seed had formed.

Lot 3, on alfalfa and corn, were often ring during the first two months, but their gains wmild indicate that it was not serious at any time. Lot 1, on corn and prairie hay, were inclined to seour somewhat at first, but later were more or less constipated if anything. All lots were given salt freely. Lot 1 consumed more than any other lot.

The heavy spring rains kept yards unusually muddy during a large part of May. gains made at these times were considerably below The s made in good weather. Too much emphasis can not laced upon the importance of having well drained and yards. Cattle lie down a great deal of the time if given y l*»d, and the extra gains made under such conditions j than repay for labor and bedding material.

One lot was corn-meal 90 per cent, oil-meal 10 per cent, and grass. ! grass fields were equal in size and the pasture in each sisted of a mixture of blue grass, brome grass, meadow •ue, prairie grass, and a little alfalfa.

It was very noticeable all through the experiment that the lot having oil-meal was much less troubled with scours, which may partially account for the greater gains of At the dose of the experiment the steers were in excellent finish and would have topped the market had they been sold at the time. They were held over, however, until about Feb - ruary 1st for purposes of instruction in the School of Agri - culture. At that time they sold in South Omaha for S.~.r&gt;0 per hundred, topping the market 65 cents. Having received but little grain on alfalfa the first win - a half grain ration the second winter, and full feed on M the following summer, these steers consumed for the whole period an average of but 5.9 pounds of grain for one </seg>
