TERRITORIAL JOURNALISM. 

Address of the President, Hon. J. Sterling Morton, Tuesday Evening, 
January 11, 1896. 

Ladies and Gentlemen — There is no material work of our 
race anywhere in any age that did not first have a mental 
concept. It existed primarily in some human intellect. The 
artist who attempts on canvas the reproduction of some 
beautiful scene in nature asks a great deal from his own 
personality and trusts largely upon his skill, his experience 
and imagination. The sculptor who sees in the formless 
mass of marble some beautiful piece of statuary, which mus 
be brought out by his chisel, asks of himself and of Provi 
dence a great deal for the fruition of his mental image. Bu 
it occurs to me that the pioneers of a new country ask more 
of life than either the painter or the sculptor. They who 
saw in these vast plains stretching from the Missouri river 
to the Rocky mountains the great commonwealth which is 
now left on this canvas asked a great deal to live to see the 
fruition of their thought and the completion in part of this 
great painting of the prairies. 

It has been assigned to me to tell you something of the 
early forecasters of the future of Nebraska. 

The eyes and ears of the United States first gave attention 
to the existence of journalism in Nebraska during the latte 
part of July, 1854. On the 28th day of that month a paper 
named the Arrow (published in Omaha every Friday by J 
E. Johnson and J. W. Pattison, editors and proprietors; 
first hurled itself upon a waiting public. But it was really 
printed and issued at Council Bluffs in the office of the 
Council Bluffs Bugle, which was owned and edited by J. E

Johnson. It was not at all out of keeping with his domestic 
relations for Mr. Johnson to have two newspapers, as he 
was a polygainic Mormon and at that time enjoyed the do 
mestic felicity of three Mrs. Johnsons in the same domkili-. 
He was a man with the courage of his convictions. From a 
leading editorial in this first number of the Arroic, entitled 
"A Night in our Sanctum," we copy: 

"To dreamland we went. The busy hum of business fro 
factories and the varied branches of mechanism from Omah 
City reached our ears. The incessant rattle of innumerab 
drays over the paved streets, the steady tramp of ten tho 
sand of an animated, enterprising population; the hoarse 
orders fast issued from the crowd of steamers upon the levee 
loading with the rich products of the state of Nebraska am 
unloading the fruits and products of other climes and soi 
greeted our ears. Far away from toward the setting su 
came telegraphic dispatches of improvements, progress, an&lt; 
moral advancement upon the Pacific Coast. Cars, fu 
freighted with teas, silks, etc., were arriving thence ant 
pawing across the stationary channel of the Missour 
river with lightning speed, hurrying on to the Atlantic sea 
board. The third express train on the Council Bluff 
&amp; Galveston Kailroad came thundering close by us 
with a shrill whistle that brought us to our feet, 
knife in hand. We rubbed our eyes, looked into th 
darkness beyond to see the flying train. It had vanishe&lt; 
and the shrill second neigh of our lariated horses gave in 
dication of danger near. The hum of business in an 
around the city had also vanished, and the same ru( 
camp fires were before us. We slept again, and daylig] 
stole upon us refreshed and ready for another day's labor 

E another paragraph of the same issue of the Omaha 
10 is "A Word to the Editorial Fraternity," in which 
re. Johnson and Pattison declare: 

r\'e now look to you all for fraternal assistance in this, 
honest attempt to establish a good, substantial paper, </seg>

            <seg id="p014">

upon this land, of general interest, whose object is and will 
be to transfer everything pertaining to the country through 
the Arrow to the wide, wide world. You can, if consistent 
with honest impulses, assist us to quite an extent. The 
present settlement here will by no means yet justify the 
expenses we incur, and from those interested abroad in the 
country we look for at least a partial support — not for a 
fortune — nor do we solicit patronage through you from 
abroad because we can't afford to do otherwise." 

E'he advertising in this issue of the Arrow is not volumin. 
Mr. J. E. Johnson, the principal owner and editor of 
journal, issues what he designates "The Last Call" to 
se who have "unsettled accounts with the late Emporium 
re." 

K, Hawke &amp; Co. notify all persons indebted to them that 
will save cost by liquidating immediately. 

r5now &amp; Turley advertise real estate for sale in the towns 
Sigourney and Keokuk, Iowa, 

E. Lowe offers Omaha City lots, and closes his advertiset 
by stating : "Lots will be given to persons who wish to 
d this season." 

Maria Mynster advertises real estate for sale. 

Eut most prominent and most intimately connected with 
development of the territory is the following advertiset: 


t Attention! Settlers in Nebraska — The Gen. Marion 
s regularly between Council Bluffs and Omaha- City. 
;re need be no fear of detention, as«the boat is in constant 
ilimss for stock, teams, or foot passengers, with steam up 
[ ready crew. Come on, emigrants, this is the great cen-1 
ferry! Hurrah for Nebraska! (signed) Ferry Co., June 
1854." 

Eilliam Clancy, who subsequently distinguished himself 
member of the legislature from Washington county, 
rtises a "new arrival of an extensive stock of groceries, </seg>

            <seg id="p015">

Ems, ami provisions, ami outfits at the sign of the Big 
.Middle Broadway, Council Bluffs City, Iowa." 

Pin- executrix of the estate of C. O. Mynster, dccwcd, 
ins all persons not to purchase any town lots lying in 

the hollow below the powder magazine, vlaimed by Wm. (1. 
Brown. A. J. Ilanscom. or Hepner, Baldwin, Test, or Larimer, 
as the same are the property of the estate of the decedent, 
C. 0. Myuster." 

J. 1). Baylis advertises a bakery and eating house, while 
his brother. S. S. Baylis calls attention "to the new, elegant, 
and commodious Pacific House of Council Bluffs as a hav-n 
of rest for travelers." 

John Keller advertises that a large pine lumber yard has 
lieen epoMd in Council Bluffs. 

John Mc.Mechan &amp; Co. (who subsequently moved to Ne 
braska City) advertise an extensive assortment of grocerka 
and provisions. 

Tootle &amp; Jackson likewise offer a general assortment of 
goods, together with a prime article of osage orange seed 
for hedges. 

One of the most unique, and, at this day, antique articles 
advertised for sale by J. E. Johnson, agent, is ''Child's California 
Guides, giving a distinct and proper description of 
the road to California, made by and from the author's personal 
observation, and also copies from the Mormon Guide, 
with full directions for an outfit, and various other n&lt; 
sary instruction and advice. This is a good, correct, and 
neat article, and may be sent by mail free of postage to the 
purchaser for 50 cents." 

Eut it is not possible in a paper as brief as this to make 
iled mention of all commercial advertisements in the 
number of the first paper published as from Omaha, 
Neb. In it, however, attorneys who advertise for clients are : 
A. W. Babbitt, Franklin Street, Marshall Turley, John W. 
tlly, Joseph L. Sharp, Jas. D. Test. Johnson &amp; Cassidy, 
E. Stone, A. C. Ford, Wm. Corfield, A. V. Larimer, W. 0. </seg>

Imes, and L. M. Cline. No physician advertise* in that 
tie of the Arrow — which is an implied compliment to the 
rity of the Nebraska atmosphere and the healthfulness of 
&gt; climate at that day. Aud while no '"big medicine men" 
re ottering their services through the Arrow for the restor 
on or perpetuation of health among the frontiersmen, a 
(sjR'ctus for the Xebruxka PuUa&lt;l'uim, which was to give 
litation to the settlement and improvement to the trans- 
Bsouri country, was printed in this number. The Pulla\m 
was really the first newspaper printed and published 
the Territory of Nebraska, and was edited by H. E. Heed 
1 set up and printed by Thomas Morton, Dan rarjM'iiter, 
1 A. D. Long. The prospectus declares that the Pulludium 
1 be published at Bellevue, and then states: 

"This paper will be strenuously devoted to the support of 
the great interests involved in the early settlement of this 
rich, beautiful, and desirable country. It will be an earnest 
advocate of the immediate establishment of those industrial, 
social, political, and religious institutions which can avail 
a permanence to society. 

I 'The finest portion of this magnificent territory has aldy 
been purchased of its aboriginal owners, who will soon 
transferred to more distant wilds and leave beautiful Neska 
free to receive the ever-enduring impress of the white 
n's energy, genius, and taste. 

EThe Palladium will be zealously devoted to the social, po:al, 
and moral interest* of the vast multitudes who will 
i transfer their interests to this country and begin the 
idation of future prosperity, freedom, and happiness, 
higher interests of education and Christianity will find 
gilant and an impartial advocate in the Palladium. 

"Our political faith and character will correspond with 
that of the great Democratic party of the United States and 
be a true exponent of republican principles. We shall be 
independent and honorable in our course with friends and 
foes and follow no party when it departs from the standard </seg>

E righteousness and truth. We shall avoid a state of 
trality upon all subjects, especially upon questions that 
te to the great moral interests of mankind." 

tA.ll of the foregoing is promised by the Palladium for $2 
r annum, invariably in advance, and is signed "Reed, 
tham &amp; Co., editors and proprietors." 

Mr. Reed came originally to the territory as a teacher at 
the Presbyterian Mission School for the Omaha Indians. 
He was a man between thirty-five and forty years of age, of 
fairly good ability, excellent moral character, and not much 
energy. Neither was he qualified by habits of study or writing 
for the position of an editor. His partner, Mr. Latham, 
was a downright, old-style, first-family-of-Virginia man, who 
prided himself particularly upon his powers as an orator 
and his gifts as a writer. He was a lawyer of considerable 
repute and (aside from a habit of at times drinking more firewater 
than was good for him) a man of fine reputation. He 
was a member of the First Territorial Legislative Assembly 
from the county of Cass — in which he never lived. My 
memory gives me no suggestion of what became of Mr. Reed 
or Mr. Latham after the spring of 1855; but I have an impression 
that they both left the Territory and that Latham 
died sometime before 1860 either in Council Bluffs or Glen- 

The Palladium was first issued in November, 1854, at 
Bellevue, from a hewed-log edifice known as the McKinney 
House, which stood between the old Presbyterian Mission 
at its southeast and the trading post of the American Fur 
Company at its northeast, near the bank of the Missouri 
river. The pioneer number printed in that town is 16, of 
volume I, and bears date Wednesday, November 15, 1854. 
In its editorial column we find : 

"The first printers in our office, and who have set up the 
present number, are natives of three different states — Ohio, 
Virginia, and Massachusetts, namely : Thomas Morton, foreman, 
Columbus, 0. (but Mr. Morton was born in England) ; </seg>

I». Long, compositor, Virginia; Henry M. Reed, apprentiit 
sachusetts. At the moment our foreman had the press 
ly for operation, the following persons were — not by invi 
&gt;n, but providentially — present to witness its first opera 
, viz., His Excellency, T. B. Cuming, Governor of Ne 
ika, and Mrs. T. B. Cuming; Hon. Fenner Ferguson 
¦f Justice of Nebraska, and Mrs. Fenner Ferguson; Rev 
liam Hamilton, of the Otoe and Omaha Mission, and Mrs 
liam Hamilton; Major Jas. M. Gatewood, of Missouri 
A.. Griffin, of Bellevue; Arthur Ferguson, of Bellevue; A 
dergrift, Esq., of Missouri ; Rird B. Chapman, candidat 
Congress from Nebraska Territory; Geo. W. Hollister 
., of Bellevue; Theodore S. Gilmore, Chicago, 111.; MiN 
•y Hamilton and Miss Amanda Hamilton of Bellevue. 

ETfie first proof-sliest was taken by His Excellency Govor 
Cuming. which was taken from the press and read bv 
i Honor Chief Justice Ferguson. Thus, quietly and unemoniously, 
was the birth time of printing in Bellevue 
• raska — thus was the Nebraska Palladium inaugurated 
&gt; the public service. This event, although to some it may 
¦ unimportant now, will form an epoch in history which 
1 be remembered ages after those present on this interest- 

ing occasion are no more. 

I Prior to the issue of this number the Palladium was printed 
St. Mary, in Mills county, Iowa, just across the Missouri 
rer, opposite Bellevue. This copy contains also the follow 


I "Removal of Our Office. — We hope our readers will ex. 
se the late appearauce of this number. We have been r» 
aving our office from St. Mary, on which account we hav 
lien short of the regular time for the issue of our pape 
iout three days — and for the same reason we shall issu 
i paper until a week from Tuesday next." 

» Among other editorial notices in this issue of the 16th of 
jvember, 1854, the following appears: 

"A. R. Gilmore, Esq., of Chicago, J. Sterling Morton, aa- 

I </seg>

nit oilitor of the Detroit Free Press, and lady, Dr. E. N. 
I'pjolin, of Michigan, arrived at Bellevue on the 13th instant." 

I It lias been a rule of the writer of ttis paper never to 
rrect journalistic misrepresentations concerning himself, 
it now, after the lapse and silence of forty-three years, the 
Ie is waived and suspended long eaoogh to state that he 
is not the assistant editor of the Detroit Free Press at the 
ne of his arrival in Nebraska on November 13, 1854, alnigh 
he had, even while in his teens, oeen a contributor to 
\t journal, which was then owned and edited by Wilber F. 
irey, who subsequently made the Chicago Times the great, 
strongest, and most influential newspaper in the North- 

This number of the Palladium contains the proceedings of 
the regular meeting of the Bellevue Claim Club, wherein the 
boundaries of the dominion of that association are laid down 
vita great precision, and wherein also claimants are required 
to register within thirty days, and in case of failure their 
claims are to be declared vacant and liable to be taken by any 
person entitled to hold a claim. 

It is perhaps well enough in this generation to explain tha 
a claim in the North Platte country at that time consisted o 
320 acres of government, unsurveyed land. Any America 
citizen had the right, under the Claim Club laws and regul 
tions of that section of the territory, to measure and stak 
out 320 acres and place a cabin or a foundation for a lo 
rabia upon it and have it recorded in the Claim Club book 
and then sell it, or hold it for preemption, as to one-half o 
it. The preemption law at that time in vogue permitted th 
proving-up upon only 1G0 acres by each preemptor. The ori; 
inal design was that each of the first settlers should take an&lt; 
hold two quarters, and then if possible sell one of them fo 
enough to pay the United States $200 for preempting th 
other. And if more than enough for that purpose could be 
secured by the selling of a "squatter's right," all the bette 
for the first claimant. </seg>

TERRITORIAL JOURNALISM. 

Elorace Everett, who afterwards became a prominent citiof 
Council Bluffs and a real estate owner in all of western 
ra, has a communication in this first number of the Pallam 
in which he says : 

"What all your readers want is territorial news — anything 
that relates to the country west of the Missouri. Please 
send your paper to Horace Everett, Gainesville, Alabama." 

tOne of the most interesting features of this pioneer journal 
found on its fourth page. At the head of the first column, 
der the word "Agricultural," these two lines appear: 

"He that by the plow would thrive, 
Himself must either hold or drive." 

BAnd immediately under that, set in italics, is the following, 
lich I believe to be historically true to the letter: 

("This is the first column of reading matter set in the Terriry 
of Nebraska. This was put in type on the 14th of Nomber, 
1854, by Thomas Morton." 

It is apparent that Thomas Morton fully realized the printing 
and publishing possibilities of the future, and that furthermore 
he had faith in that "column of reading matter" 
as the first part of a sure foundation upon which a great 
social and civil superstructure was to be erected and per- 

Kln the same column is a recommendation to "eat beets 
ked, because potatoes are scarce and high." 

K Further along is an article on harvesting corn and another 
cheap carpeting. 

P. A. Sarpy advertises the Bluff City &amp; St. Louis Packet 
Line on the Missouri river. The steamers El Paso, Polar 
Star, and James H. Lucas compose the line, and are declared 
to be boats "not excelled for safety, speed, and comfort, 
and shippers and the traveling community may rely 
upon the permanency of this line. Through freights and* 
passengers will meet with but a few hours' detention at St. </seg>

I The business directory of the Palladium is not extensive, 
t very suggestive of enterprise. I. II. Bennett advertises 
boardiag-lKMMe at Bellevue; W. K. English offen his ser«a 
as a Kgotiator, collector, general land agent and eoun!or 
at law, and states in his card that he has had an experiie 
(he does not say of what kind) of seventeen years, in 
1 Territory. C. E. Watson advertises as land agent, surior, 
and engineer; George Ilepner offers his services as a 
m dor at law; G. W. Wallace tenders his abilities as a 
ysidan and surgeon; Bruno Tzschuck offers his profesnal 
services to the citizens of St. Mary and vicinity as a 
rveyor and engineer, he having an office in Peter A. Sarpy's 
ner of Gregory street. Mr. Tzschuck has since been 
di- ai-quainted with Nebraska as one of its ablest secrees 
of state, and is, I believe still living at or ne.ir Bellevue 
his farm. Watson, Kinuey &amp; Green offer land for sale and 
i-wise tow u lots. The Astor House, by William Ingall, St. 
iry, Iowa, solicits a share of public favor. 

( n November 29, 1854, the I'alludium issued a number contain.

"Thaxkscivixc. — llis Excellency, the Chief Magistrate o

(In the issue of the Palladium for December 6, 1854, we fin&lt; 
communication from Frederick V. Hayden, who subse 
ently became distinguished as a scientist and prominen 
as the head of the geological survey for the government o 
the United States. Professor Hayden, with whom I becam 
very friendly and intimate, passed that winter at Bellevue 
In this communication Hayden says; 

I The geological formation around Bellevue is carbonifer, 
which extends as far as the Big Sioux river, where the 
:aceous formation commences. Fine beds of coal may be 
ibited when a thorough survey is made. About a mile 
th of Bellevue the bluffs strike the river, and a valuable 
of limestone is exposed. This will have an important 
ring on the settlement of Bellevue. A geological section 
t would be as follows : first, an argillaceous schistose limele 
of a yellowish color, very compact, not suitable for 
e, but well adapted for building purposes. This bed is 
y near the water's edge. Second, a coarse-grained, greywhite 
limestone, containing no clay and therefore suitable 
lime. This is an important bed and second only to a coal 
ie in its value to this portion of the territory." 

This same 6th of December number of the Palladium contains 
the following :

The Palladium of January 3, 1855, gives a rather vigorous 
writing-up of a territorial convention which had been held 
December 30, 1854, at Nebraska City, 

"For the purpose of taking into consideration the present 
unfortunate political condition of the Territory and of expressing 
the views of the people in relation to the motives 
by which Acting Governor Cuniing has been guided in the 
management of the affairs of the said Territory." 

Among the delegates present at that convention were : 
Stephen Decatur, Geo. W. Hollister, B. B. Thompson, Philip 
E. Shannon, Jas. O'Neil, Jas. H. Decker, Simpson Hargus, H. 
Bennett, A. M. Rose, C. H. Cowles, John Clements, Louis 
rnutt, Nelson Ilopkins, R. W. Frame, Jesse Cole, E. Wyatt, 
P. Handley, and J. Sterling Morton. The last was chairman 
of a committee on resolutions which made a very 
Kppery report. It submitted resolutions for the considera•n 
of the body of the convention, which, after a long and </seg>

spirited debate, were unanimously adopted. The last resolution 
recommended to President Pierce Gen. Bula M. 
Hughes, of Missouri, for Governor ; and Dr. P. J. McMahon, 
of Iowa, for Secretary of the Territory of Nebraska. 

I The last Bomber of the PmUmdimm bears d;ite April 11, 
55, and its leading article is relative to the murder of Geo. 
. Hollister, a graduate of Yale College, who had been shot 
death by Chas. A. Henry. The funeral services of Mr.

t third page tlie editor formally announces the suspension 
the Palladium, and with solemnity consigns it to death 

The Nebraska City Xcws was first issued November 14, 
1854, as being published at Nebraska City (Henry Bradford, 
editor), while really it was printed and issued at Sidney, 
Fremont county, Iowa. But in the spring of 1855 the scribe 
now making this historical record entered into a contract 
with the Town Site Company of Nebraska City by which 
he became, at the remunerative compensation of |50 per 
month, the editor in charge of and sole director and general 
manager of the enormous plant which was to continue 
the utterance of the weekly Nebraska City News. 
Therefore, from the second story of the U. S. Military 
Block House, which had been constructed in the year 
1846 under the direction of Capt. Stewart Van Vliet 
(who, as a retired brigadier -general, is now living in Washington, 
D. C. ), the first number of the Nebraska City Neica 
was, on April 12, 1855, duly sent to press and launched upon 
a waiting and astonished world. Under the terms of my 
contract with the Town Site Company, I had the right to 
employ and discharge printers and all the other employees 
at pleasure. Therefore, having known Thomas Morton, an 
Englishman (no kin of the writer), at Bellevue, as a most 
competent, steady, and industrious printer, I immediately 
secured him as foreman of the News office. Then began a </seg>

El and business relation and a personal friendship which 
d without break or interruption until the grave closed 
een him and the writer hereof. 

In those days the rivals of Nebraska City were constantly 
publishing the statement that its site was a military reservation 
and that consequently no good titles could be given to 
lots. This rumor was so persistently repeated and so generally 
circulated by other town site companies on the Missouri 
river that it really worked great injury to the holders 
of property in and about the county-seat of what was then 
Pierce, and is now Otoe county. However, by continued correspondence, 
we at last drew a letter from Jefferson Davis, 
then Secretary of War in the Cabinet of Franklin Pierce, 
stating very distinctly and conclusively that this town site 
\\;is not a military reservation, and that it never had been 
one, except for very temporary purposes. Each newspaper 
in the Territory was at that time merely the advance agent 
of a town company which was to act either successfully or 
otherwise in the drama of building a city — of establishing 
and maintaining a municipality. Out of this fact was evolved 
a M'lfish style of journalism and a markedly personal sort of 
paragraphing. Sectionalism between the North and South 
Platte was evolved from this sort of newspaper writing, and 
it grew to a bitterness and heat which led in later years to a 
serious convention, the delegates to which were pledged to 
do all in their power to annex South Platte Nebraska to 
Kansas. In fact, a convention was held in the latter state 
and delegates attended from every county south of the Platte 
river. Fortunately, however, Nebraska did not become a 
scion on the trunk of Kansas, though sometimes it seems to 
have been infected by microbes of its isms and vagaries. 

Among the early newspapers came the Xcbraxkian, published 
at Omaha in the interest of Bird B. Chapman, of 
Elyria, Ohio, who was running for Congress in this Territory 
at that time. Its editor was Mr. John Sherman, likewise 
from Ohio, but not identical with the present Secretary of </seg>

Iite, though, if living, he would be about the same age. 
itor Sherman was a man of about thirty-five years of age, 
good physique, and more than average intellect, and great 
ility and lerspicacity as a writer of sharp, pungent paratpha. 


EJut I shall not track on Omaha newspaperdom any 
ther, because I have hoped that Dr. (Jeo. L. Miller would 
e up the early days of journalism in that propinquity and 
h his facile pea and felicity of expression give us a comte 
record of its infancy. 

Nevertheless, in justice, one can not leave the subject of 
journalism at Omaha and its effects upon that commercial 
center and the state of Nebraska without telling some little 
of the truth about the influence of the Omaha Daily Hcrahl, 
edited by Dr. Miller, in laying the foundations and ably aiding 
in the upbuilding of a metropolis on the west bank of 
the Missouri river. Dr. Miller issued the first number of the 
Daily Herald in the year IMS. He continued to issue "Daily 
Ilr raids" for more than twenty years. There was no day in 
any month in any one of the twenty years in which he was 
not an enthusiastic believer in the possibilities — commercial 
and agricultural — of the whole state. At no time did his 
faith waver or his persistent industry flag. Every morning 
there was something new in the way of hope, suggestion, or 
fact for the benefit and development of Omaha and its resources. 
Each morning the columns of the Daily Herald 
boiled over with buoyant enthusiasm and exuberant faith 
which animated every nerve, fiber, and brain tissue of the 
robust and able editor who dictated its policy and evolved 
its thoughts. It is my candid opinion that there is no instance 
in all the history of the Northwest where the thought 
and pen of a single individual has done so much to build up 
any community or city as did the pen and thought of Dr. 
Miller for Omaha and Douglas county. If the present inhabitants 
of Omaha, numbering something more than 100,000, 
should each of them write an article setting forth the ad- </seg>

vantages — agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing — in 
the state of Nebraska on each day of the week for six months 
to come, they would not have achieved as much imnuscript 
and as much effectively good work in behalf of their homes 
as Dr. Miller performed in the twenty years during which he 
so diligently labored for the upbuilding of that community. 
No other man, either by the power of money, or by the power 
of brawn, or by the strength of brain, did as much to make 
Omaha a city as this one man accomplished. 

Among early newspapers in the smaller towns or settlements 
in the Territory, the Nebraska Enquirer, by A. W. 
Merrick, published at DeSoto, in Washington county, played 
an important part. Mr. Merrick was succeeded as editor by 
Hugh McNeely. The Enquirer's best work was between the 
years 1858 and 1861. During the campaign of 18G0 it was 
an ardent and active supporter of the Republican ticket, 
national and territorial. 

The Nemaha Herald issued its first number of vol. I at 
Nemaha City on the morning of November 24, 1859. It continued 
its existence under the management of Fairbrother &amp; 
Hacker until sometime in the early 'GO's when its publication 
ceased. 

The Nebraska Advertiser was established at Brownville by 
Dr. John McPherson in 1856, and I have found copies of it 
running from October 27, 1859, to November 22, 1860, when 
it was published by Furnas &amp; Lyanna. 

The Advertiser was pronouncedly an advocate of the ma 
terial development of Brownville and Nemaha county. ] 
was a strong believer in the horticultural and agricultura 
possibilities of Nebraska soil. Its editor from 1856 to 186 
was ltobert W. Furnas, since Governor of the State, who ha 
been one of the most self-sacrificing and persistently indu 
trious men in behalf of the upbuilding in this state of a 
that makes prosperity and happiness for its citizens. Ther 
is no Nebraskan in public or in private life who has, durin 
a period of forty years, performed a greater, better, and a </seg>

the same time less remunerative labor than has Robert W. 
Furnas in his thoughtful and diligent efforts for the development 
of the true methods of home-building in this state. History 
will give him a peerless position among the pioneers who 
laid the social and esthetic foundations of this commonwealth. 


I Che People's Press was established at Nebraska City b 
sh &amp; Matthias in the spring of 1859, and No. 4T of vol. 
3 issued on November 11 of that year. It has continue* 
1 worked, like its competitor in that town, to the presen 
r, although it has met with more changes of ownership an 
torial control than has the Nebraska City News. As 
e, the Press has been fairly, decently, and ably conducts 
a political way; and has always, according to its ligh 
n a faithful supporter of the interests of Otoe county an&lt; 
braska City. 

Ehe Nebraska Republican was established at Omaha in 
year 1858 but passed out of existence about 1889, as I 
recall it. 

Irhe Omaha Times was established with Geo. W. Hepburn 
editor and proprietor, in the autumn of 1857, at Omaha, 
subsequently came into the possession of W. W. Wyuian, 
I postmaster at Omaha, during the Buchanan administran, 
and expired sometime during the year 1870. 

IThe Wyoming Telescope, of Wyoming, Otoe county, was 
;ablished in 1857 by Jacob Dawson, editor and proprietor, 
was edited during the year 1859 by S. N. Jackson, who pubhes 
his valedictory on July 30 of that year. 

The Omaha Nebraskian began its sixth year in January, 
1860, and on the 28th of that month the issue (being edited 
by T. H. Robertson and M. H. Clark) contains very interesting 
correspondence from Washington, dated January 16, it 
takjng at that time twelve days to convey a letter by United 
States mail from the Federal capital to the west bank of the 
Missouri river. Peculiar zest is given to this correspondence 
from the fact that it is written by Dr. Geo. L. Miller, then </seg>

Iourning at the capital. The Doctor mentions the fact that 
illiani A. Richardson, of Illinois, who had been the Govlor 
of this Territory, was in Washington attracting much 
cntion ami in close communion with Senator Douglas, of 
inois. The Doctor seems, judging from his epistles, to be 
•y much interested in securing a land grant for the purpose 
building a tr::ns -continental line of railroad which should 
ke Omaha the initial point on the Missouri river. Even 
that early day Dr. Miller cherished Pacific railroad buildj 
as a chronic ambition. 

|)n July G, 1800, Dr. Miller corresponds with the Nchra 
n from St. Joseph, Mo., and informs its readers of th 
ing in at St. Joseph of a large grocery-store buildin 
led by Nave &amp; McCord. The edifice was supposed to be 
of the strongest in the city, but without premonition 
, burying in its ruins twelve persons, seven of whom wer 
en out dead when the Doctor communicated with th 
iraskiun. 

Il'lie year 1S59 was probably the most prolific of newspapers 
any in the entire history of the Territory. It was in th 
•ly part of that year that we first began to receive new 
m the Etockj mountains confirming the legends of gol&lt; 
paying quantities about Auraria on Cherry creek, wher 
! city of Denver is now flourishing. Hon. A. A. Brookfieh 
brmer mayor of Nebraska City, is noticed in the News o 
Ij 23, L86S, as having just returned from the gold diggings 
I the editor declares that he has "brought some beautifu 
lriirna which we have felt, seen, and handled, one to th 
lue of $3.05 of solid gold, which looks as if it had bee 
lted and hammered out. He has other specimens, some o 
artz-bearing." 

And the Nebraska City News of July 23, 1859, also contains 
a reprint from a letter of Horace Greeley. During that summer 
(Jreeley, Schuyler Colfax, and Deacon William Bross

for some time at Denver. Greeley, writing to the New York 
Tribune on July 15 of that year, says: 

1*1 never visited a region where physical life could be more 
•ely prolonged or more fully enjoyed. Thousands who rush 
•e for gold will rush away again, disappointed and dis-3ted, 
as thousands have already done; and yet the gold is 
these mountains and the right men will gradually unearth 
I shall be mistaken if two millions or three millions are 
t taken out this year, and some ten millions in 18G0, though 
the time there will be, as now, a stream of rash adventurheading 
away from the diggings, declaring that there is 
gold there, or next to none. So it was in California and in 
stralia. So it must be here where the obstacles to be overne 
are greater and the facilities for getting home decidedly 
ter. All men are not fitted bv nature for gold-diggers; yet 
msands will not realize this until they have been convinced 
it by sore experience. . . . 

I 'Mining is a pursuit akin to fishing and hunting and, like 
i m, enriches the few at the cost of the many. This region 
loubtless preordained to many changes of fortunes — to-day 
Idy with the intoxication of success, to-morrow in the valley 
humiliation. One day report will be made on the Missouri 
a party of disappointed gold seekers that the Rocky mounn 
humbug has exploded and everybody is fleeing for the 
ites who can possibly get away. The next report will repent 
these diggings as yellow with gold. Neither will be 
ie; yet each in its turn will have a certain substratum of 
t for its justification." 

thave ventured to quote the above from Horace Greeley's 
ver correspondence, relative to mining, because it is 
»pos at this time of Klondike excitements which are carryso 
many people to the gold fields of Alaska. 

But this paper is already too far extended. It is my duty 
to end it In doing so I suggest that the Nebraska State Historical

editors of the Territory and State whenever and wherever </seg>

NEWSPAPERS OP THE TERRITORIAL PERIOD. 

NEWSPAPERS AND NEWSPAPER MEN OF THE 

TERRITORIAL PERIOD. 

By Dr. George L. Miller. 

Jjadics and Gentlemen: 

I ask your indulgence for a moment to state in advance of 
the paper which I shall read to j-ou, the fact that it has been 
made necessary, by circumstances which I need not explain, 
for me to cover something of the same ground already occupied 
by the paper of your distinguished president. 

Perhaps, in what might be called a careless effort to pro 
duce in performance a suitable acceptance of the invitatio 
witli which I was honored by the Historical Society, to recorc 
in its archives some account of a few of the newspapers am 
newspaper men of the Territorial period, I have been more 
surprised than I probably should have been if I had l&gt;ee 
more industrious at the difficulty of securing accurate dat 
in respect to the names, characters, and lives of those whose 
office it was, in the formative periods of this state, to giv 
intelligent direction to the remarkable work of the first se 
tlement. It was not easy, and in some cases it was foun&lt; 
impracticable, to trace the fortunes of these men in the late 
years, but it may be safely said that a great majority of those 
who printed and published, and who frequently contribute* 
courage, strength, and sometimes an elegant and powerfu 
style to the columns of the early newspaper, have long bee 
slumbering in half-forgotten graves. Sad and suggestive i 
the thought that they were not permitted to live long enough 
to see the rich and abounding fruits of their ardent hopes am 
labors. Achievement has so far outrun the wildest dreams o 
the most sanguine men of those days, who assisted to lay th </seg>

foundations of the State, as to simply bewilder and amaze 
those who survive to tell the story of their work, to take note 
of the value of their services, and to do fitting honor to their 
memories. 

The first appearance of the territorial newspaper was prac- 
Ueallj coincident with the white occupation. This occupation 
was, of course, almost entirely confined to the boundary 
marked by the great river which, now as then, is suggestive 
of the barbarism of which it will remain typical as long as 
tlie remote reservoirs of the Rocky mountains continue to 
furnish the supply of its turbid waters. It is the only survival 
of savagery which resists and defies subjugation at the 
hands of civilized man in our great state and section, and 
here it will remain until the fountains from which it flows 
in tributary streamlet, rivulet, and river shall have evaporated 
into wandering vajnjr, mist, and cloud. Only about 
six centers worthy of the name seemed to attract the few 
score of white people who came into the new land in quest of 
home and opportunity in 1854. These primitive foci of human 
hopes and endeavor began to take crude form in the 
middle and later months of that year, at r.rownville, in 
Xeinaha county, at Nebraska City, in Otoe county, at Plattsmouth, 
in Cass county, and at Bellevue, Omaha, and Florence 
in what was then Douglas county. In what is now the 
chief city of the State, as it was seen in October of that 
year by men still living, there were, in my own belief, not 
more than nine heads of families and one little girl who had 
decided to make homes on the site of the town which now 
contains more than 100,000 inhabitants. Kichard Brown, 
ita founder, and a few others camped in small cabins in 
Brownville. S. F. Nuckolls and J. Sterling Morton counted 
as many as a whole dozen of ordinary men in their own 
strong and strenuous personalities in Ctoe's now comely 
capital. Col. Joseph F. Sharp, soon to be the lynx-eyed, 
one-eyed, but very able and dignified president of the 
higher branch of the territorial legislative assembly, rep- </seg>

resented a few adventurous spirits of Cass county in 
that body, although his real residence was in Glenwood, 
Iowa. Peter A. Sarpy, the gallant Indian trader, Judge 
Fenner Ferguson, Mr. Thomas Morton, who was merely 
gypsying in Bellevue, with that miraculous printing art 
of his, preparatory to the life-work into which it led" him 
at Nebraska City a few months later, L. L. Bowen, and 
Silas A. Strickland did most of the large talking for Bellevue. 
Gov. Thomas B. Cuming, Acting Governor A. J. Poppleton, 
A. J. Hanscom, and a few more stood for the coming 
supremacy of Omaha, and James M. Mitchell, in the ho"t 
rivalry for Florence, fought out the contest which located 
the territorial capital, the supreme object of desire, at 
Omaha. The fight was a fierce one while it lasted, and was 
to a finish, Mr. Fitzsiinmons residing in Omaha. But the 
picture would fail to be properly painted without a moments 
notice of the original owners of the soil who were on the 
ground in person to receive the first wave of invasion of 
the new land by the white man, the Omaha Indians, whose 
gallant chief, Logan Fontanelle, was slain by the Sioux in 
1855. Their familiar forms and features are recalled for 
mere mention. The presence of white men sobered them 
into a serious, silent, and sometimes sullen, demeanor, as, 
with stolid resignation and sad hearts, they realized that 
the bell was already tolling for the death of all that was so 
dear to them in their memories and traditions. Their mournful 
faces told the story of broken hearts, now that the hour 
had come for their final farewell to their ancient homes 
and hunting grounds, at the peaceful, but none the less 
forceful, bidding and power of that other savage, that moneygetting, 
land-grabbing pirate, the all-conquering Anglo- 
Saxon, a bad brother of yours and mine, to whom the invention 
of gunpowder and the death-dealing machinery employed 
in human butchery, on land and sea, hr.ve vouchsafed to 
Kvilization which boastaand believes in the Christian name, 
versal domination of the children of men. It was the </seg>

first close contact of white men with barbarism on the soil 
of the coming commonwealth. The shifting scenes and cha 
acters that appeared on the Nebraska stage before the cu 
tain rose upon a community of order regulated by law wer 
singularly strange to all who gave them life and color, lie 
from nearly every state in the Union, attracted by the wor 
of Franklin Pierce and Stephen A. Douglas, came droppin 
in. one by one, with their various manners and speech. Th 
refined and scholarly sons of Ohio, Michigan, and other states 
nude up a full quota for the little army which met and min 
gled here with the rough-hewn denizens of theWabash and th 
Ouachita on the level plane of common necessities and com 
mon purposes. There was, in truth, a general Dolly Varde 
¦ rtment of the younger American manhood, led by sue 
brilliant and controlling men as Cuming, Morton, Woo 
worth, Poppleton, Nuckolls, Mason, and a few more, whose 
business it was to make speedy conquest of the new land 
to civilized rule. 

If apology were needed for this hurried presentment o 
conditions which the newspapers and newspaper me 
•ountered in the primitive periods of the Nebraska lif 
s, I think, to be readily found in the fact that, to kuo 
at men do in planting new communities and states, w 
st first know what was set them to do, what they wer 
nking about, and what they had at heart to plan and con 
uct out of the wild waste and chaos, moral, religious, am 
terial, which constituted the environment on this the 
mte borderland forty-three years ago.

from the day of the discovery by the Venetians of what 
Carlyle calls "those poor bits of rag-paper with black ink on 
them." For, indeed, whatever be the outward form of the 
thing, bits of paper, as we may say, and black ink, it is the 
thought of man. "This London City," continued the great 
Scotchman, "with all its houses, palaces, steam-engines, 
cathedrals, and huge immeasurable traffic and tumult, what 
is it but a Thought, but millions of Thoughts made into 
one — a huge, immeasurable Spirit of a Thought embodied 
in brick, in iron, smoke, dust, palaces, parliaments, hackney 
coaches, Katherine docks, and the rest of it! Not a brick 
was made but some man had to think of the making of that 
brick." The thing we call "bits of paper with traces of black 
ink" is the present embodiment a Thought of man can have. 
And it was one of these printed gazettns which winged its 
way into Nebraska, a newspaper magpie, piping cheerful 
notes of enlightenment and progress, on the 28th day of July, 
1854, in the form of a small, folio sheet bearing the name 
in bold, black type, of "The Omaha Arrow," the first born 
of Nebraska's newspaper family, singing sonorously that 
song of the types of which we have air heard here a full, 
though sometimes dismal and discordant, chorus, for more 
than forty years. 

Not in the .stately rhyme and rythm of Rudyard Kipling 
in that moving and majestic "Song of the English" did John 
W. Pattison sing in the Omaha Arrow of either past or 
present days. Happily for you, and for me, the distinguished 
President of this society has relieved me, in another paper, 
of the duty of producing notes from the overture to show 
the high key from which the young and prophetic warbler 
produced that marching melody in humble prose, to whose 
resistless spirit, at this day, more than one million white 
men, women, and children keep steady stop. Mr. Morton 
has given an account of the Arrow and its editors much 
better than it could have been done by me, and it only 
remains for me to say that the Omaha Arrow, a small sheet, </seg>

published by J. E. Johnson, a Mormon overmuch married, 
who was also the proprietor of the Council Bluffs Bugle, and 
edited by John YV. Pattison, a bright-minded young mnn 
who was born and died in the neighboring state of Missouri, 
embodied the central thought of the Carlyle philosophy into 
a priceless record in the newspaper history of the State. 
Not so very small was this neat publication, was this vigorous 
and lively chatterer, was this Nebraska magpie. The 
first copy of it, which contains twenty-four columns of closely 
printed matter of all sorts, including the complete text of 
the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, is a study full of interest and 
instruction. I could easily consume the time alloted to the 
reading of this paper in interpreting the business and personal 
life which is reflected in its advertising columns alone. 
But I must desist. It is in this phase of the first-born of 
Nebraska newspapers that we are again indebted to the Hon 
orable J. Sterling Morton for a record of it, and for muc 
more of this and other newspaper history of early days. Th 
last copy of the Omaha Arrow which has been preserved, ant 
probably the last that was ever printed, registered its ow 
Kimely end on Friday, November 12, 1854, after an activ 
useful life of only about ninety days. But let us no 
fail to be reminded that it lives, and will continue to liv 
for many generations of men, in the embodied thought of 
to-day which gives us the great trans-continental railway, 
the trade with China and the Pacific, the miraculous development 
of agricultural and other industries, which the young 
editor outlined in the columns of the Omaha Arrow as with 
the accurate forecast of an inspired prophet. 

As with the Omaha Arrow and other early newspapers, Mr. 
Morton has so covered the field, that I decide to confine 
myself mainly to an account of two papers in Omaha which 
belonged to the territorial times, the Omaha Republican, and 
the Omaha Herald, the first a radical organ of the Republican 
party, which was then in active embryo, and the other 
a moderate and mild, if not very modest, representative of </seg>

the Democratic party. I shall deal with them in the order of 
the time of their establishment, and with respect which 
is always due to age. But, before dealing with the Republican, 
I ask indulgence while I recur to an intimation which 
was intended to be conveyed in the opening of this discussion. 
I referred to the men who contributed the inspiration of courage, 
strength, and sometimes an elegant style to the columns 
of the early newspapers. I wish to make a few further observations 
upon this particular point. It is not the editor 
of a newspaper to whom the community in which he is commissioned 
to preach and teach is solely indebted for the 
conceded influence which he exercises upon it. That editor 
who fails to absorb and reflect the better thought of the 
superior intelligence which surrounds him is hardly worthy 
of the name. No man can teach wisely without being taught. 
No man can wisely lead who has not first learned to follow. 
The Omaha Arroic and Nebraskian caught much of their 
thought, the Nebraskian almost wholly, from the masterful 
Thomas B. Cuming, the first governor of the Territory, who 
graduated from a telegraph office as an operator in Keokuk, 
Iowa, when he was a mere boy, into national prominence, at 
first as an unknown contributor to the Dispatch of that 
place. It was an open secret that his brilliant pen frequently 
illumined the soniestimes dreary columns of the Nebraskian. 
I do not need to name the man, once the editor of the 
Nebraska City News, who has for more than forty years, 
edited, in a broad way, pretty much all the newspapers in 
the State which had any sense. If he did not write their 
editorial opinions, he furnished with aggressive thought and 
speech, inspiration, which involved vigorous support and 
equally vigorous opposition, but which lifted the subjects 
of ardent debate upon the high plane of discussion out of 
which so much has been wrought here from the untamed 
elements of savagery and chaos in the lives of living men. 
I can say for one, and even for both, of the founders of the 
Omaha Herald that, for more than ten of the twenty-three </seg>

rears of its life and work, its editor owed to the though 
the moral and intellectual support, inspiration, and appro&gt; 
ing words of J. Sterling Morton, more than to any othi 
HBgte agCBCy, whatever success was achieved by his labor 
in the upbuilding of this state. It was that then young an 
untrained editor's chief ambition in the world to be able t 
achieve the style and power of Morton on his editorial page 
which, at long intervals, be it acknowledged, was decoratci 
and dignified and Btre&amp;gtnemed by it. It was, perhaps, th 
most self-assuring of all that doubting and self-distrustin 
period of the Omaha editor's newspaper life, and it gave him 
the greatest joy, when rival newspapers would insist tha 
this, that, and the other article, which he had surely writte 
himself, were vociferously attributed to "Morton." In th 
newspaper, in public speech, and pamphlet, in essays, in his 
torical labors which find enduring record in the archives o 
this society, he has been editing this state and section durin 
a long and conspicuous life, on lines of enlightened progress 
and development. Called to the cabinet of one of the mos 
illustrious of American presidents, he has crowned a life o 
respect and honor with an educational service in which h 
has been editing statesmen for years in administrate 
wisdom and economy, by both precept and example, am 
millions of farmers to new methods of soil-culture which ax 
already bearing fruit in the state and section which he loves 
so well. Nor are these mere idle compliments, coined for 
passing occasion, or for transient effect. I desire to improv 
the only opportunity that may ever be afforded me to plac 
my own candid personal estimate of Mr. Morton's work am 
worth over my own humble name, which is among the leas 
of his contemporaries and coadjutors. 

The Nebraska Republican was established by E. F. Schneider 
and H. J. Brown. Its first issue appeared under the 
auspices of these men, May 5, 1858. I have no record or 
remembrance of them personally. My impression is that 
they were practical printers. It took the name of its party </seg>

Iich was just rising upon the ruins of its parent, the old 
lig party of honorable name. The paper was soon sold to 
. G. C. Monell who owned and gave it vigorous life until 
&gt;9. Dr. Monell was a man of strong character, intelliice, 
and cultivated mind. He hailed from Newburgh, New 
rk. As a writer, he added polish to vigor, and clear stateut 
to a comprehensive grasp in discussion. A natural 
•rbity of temper and a cynical tendency gave a keen edge 
his pen, and I think he may be fairly classed with the 
est of the sixteen editors who graced the columns of the 
publican during the thirty-two years of its existence. 

The Republican was bought. ;u&gt;d owned, and edited by E. 
D. Webster, August 15, 1859, who parted with it two years 
later, viz., September 2(5, 18(51, to E. B. Taylor and his 
brother-in-law, E. A. McClure. 

Mr. Webster is one of the best remembered of the ear 
editors of the Republican. I have no means of writing wit 
accuracy of his life and work. I shall speak of him as 
remember him, a small, black haired, brown-skinned ma 
of that nervous-bilious temperament which made him brigh 
alert, aggressive, and interesting. To political enemies 1 
was as gall and wormwood in his paper, and to those 1 
liked as genial as a girl, in private life. He came to Omah 
from Albany, New York, on the recommendation of Thurlo 
Weed who, as we all know, was the political author an&lt; 
finisher of William H. Seward as a public man, and a grea 
and powerful leader of the old Whig and the then Republ 
can parties. He was Mr. Weed's proteg£, personal and poli 
ical. As a writer he was sharp, short, and decisive. B 
had a crisp style, and was not at all times polite in dealin 
with adversaries. He was neither a prohibitionist nor 
teetotaller in his habits, which were, in the better sense, con 
vivial. His political methods were those of Mr. Weed, con 
tracted by a great lack of Mr. Weed's remarkable power a 
the editor of the Albany Journal, and as the autocrat of th 
old Whi^ Dartv of New York and the nation for thirtv vear </seg>

Mr. Webster's ability as a writer was not marked by any 
considerable strength. In party management he was aided 
liv a certain shrewdness and cunning. Perhaps his conuce 
was as keen as anybody's, in the then existing order 
in Omaha and the Territory, but it did not arrest attention 
by any violent exercise in the politics of the time. I speak 
of Mr. Webster's political conscience, of course, exclusively. 
He —weeded in keeping men of bis own party by the ears. 
and bred faction in the new party with marked success. He 
was a good hater, and had more pluck than prudence in 
fighting bis Republic** enemies which included such men 
&gt;ur own Tbayer and his predecessor, Dr. Monell. Mr. 
Webster, as we have Men, continued with the Republican 
only about two years when, at the outbreak of the Civil War, 
lie was ca 1 1 &lt; m J to Washington at the instance of his old friend 
and master, Mr. Weed, to occupy the honorable and delicate 
and responsible place Of confidential secretary to William H. 
Si ward. I saw him during those stormy periods in the discharge 
of his duties, and when one would hardly have known 
him as the same Republic** Webster, so studiously dressed 
and dignified had he become. Iu the midst of many temptations, 
he acquitted himself in his place with credit and ability. 
It was E. 1). Webster who was entrusted with the 
delivery of the order for the release of Mason and Slidell, 
who had been seized by Capt. Wilkes and the Sun JmcUUo 
from a British ship while on their way as ambassadors to 
England and France from the government of the Confederate 
States, llad he been a less trustworthy man, such was 
the strain pending the action of the President of expected 
war with England iu that case, he might have put millions 
of Wall Street money in his poor purse in a single day by the 
betrayal of one of the greatest state secrets that was ever 
confided to a private citizen. Mr. Webster returned to the 
suite of his earliest love after the war, and engaged in stockraising 
at North Matte, and afterwards in the Kepublican 
valley, where, in the meridian of his manhood, he died a few </seg>

years ago, regretted by all who knew what a really kind and 
generous spirit he was in fact. 

E. B. Taylor, the next of the honorable sixteen editors of 
the paper, was a native of Ohio. He was, perhaps, the ablest 
of all when estimated in the double character of editor of the 
paper and leader of his party. I would not willingly underestimate 
his ability as a writer. I had abundant reason to 
know that lie was never weak, that he was sometimes strong, 
and that iu the daily bouts with contemporaries, he was 
entirely able to take care of himself. I do not rememlx?r that 
he was given to the discussion of principles very muc'i. 
Trained in the Ohio school of Whig politics, he was purely 
a party editor. Perhaps this was largely due to the exciting 
questions that brought on impending war. E. B. Taylor 
did not read books very much, but he read men with keen 
judgment, and was alive to every phase of current events and 
affairs. He was a kindly man, socially. He arose from the 
printers "case," as did (Jreeley and Weed, and many more 
of the newspaper immortals, to the editorial chair, and he 
had the rare faculty of walking up to a printing case and 
setting up his editorials without the mediation of "copy." 
Mr. Taylor was the recognized leader of his party in Omaha 
and the Territory in many ways even after he sold his interest 
in the Republican to Mr. St. A. D. Balcombe, and was 
rewarded by appointment as Superintendent of the Omaha 
tribe of Indians which was then the best office in the Territory. 
During his editorial career he was supported by Mr. 
E. A. McClure as the practical manager of the Republican's 
business, who I am glad to say, is still with us. Mr. Taylor 
died in Omaha in 1872, at the age of fifty-two years, deeply 
t retted by all who knew him in his personal life to be a 
d husband and father, a strong character and citizen, and 
a loyal friend. 

In 18G5, Maj. II. H. Heath, a Tolunteer officer of the 
Union a-rmy stationed at, and commanding the post of Ft.</seg> 

            <seg id="p043">

CUM a writer on it, if not its editor. I knew Major Heath 
very well. He was not strong in any sense, but he was a 

man of education, a generous friend, and had the charm of 
polished manners. Major Heath was afterwards sent to a 
consulate in Peru, where he died, and where his remains 
repose. 

April of the year 18G6 brought another man and char 
Kter in the person of St. A. D. Balcombe, who puchand 
a half interest in the Republican and became its business 
manager. If I did not expect him to be present in person at 
ill is gathering, I should certainly say of him that in practical 
judgment, sound intelligence, and force of character he 
was the strongest man in those years who was ever connected 
with the Omaha Republican. He was the man, I have forgot 
u-n to mention before, who changed the name of the paper 
from Nebraska Republican to Omaha Republic**, indicating 
the spirit which afterwards, and during a long and influential 
life, made him a loyal and courageous advocate of the material 
interests of Omaha. I think Mr. Balcombe is a native 
of New York, but he came to us from Minnesota where, in 
the town of Winona, he developed into a prominent citizen, 
became a member of the legislature of the state, and waa 
honored with the appointment of Superintendent of the Winnebago 
and Omaha tribes of Indians. When Mr. Taylor succeeded 
him in that office, he became the sole proprietor of the 
I'&lt; publican, and likewise, for much of the five subsequent 
years, its leading editor. For a man without training in 
editorial work, and with no pretensions to superior fitness 
for his new calling, it shall be said that St. A. D. Balcoml&gt;e 
was strong enough to raise, instead of being weak enough 
to lower, the standard of its editorial columns in the discussion 
of the stirring questions of the times. He differed 
from some of his predecessors and successors in the chair 
by knowing what he wanted to say, and by commanding a 
plain and vigorous vocabulary in which to say it. In the 
remarkable growth of Omaha from a ragged, unpaved, and </seg>

unkempt country village into a semi-metropolitan city, Mr. 
Balcombe was entrusted by his fellow-citizens with the responsibility 
of directing its public improvements as Chairman 
of the Board of Public Works. There will lie no dissent 
in his home city from the statement that, in the discharge of 
the trying duties of that office, his administration was 
marked by firmness, integrity, intelligence, and remarkable 
efficiency. During this part of the life of the Republic**, 
Hon. John TafTe, afterwards serving the people two terms 
in Congress, was among the editors of the paper. Mr. Taffe 
was a lawyer by profession, I think. He was a strong writer, 
venomous in tone and temper towards political opponents, 
a strong partisan, and was much esteemed by his friends. 
He died many years ago in the maturity of his manhood. 
On January 21, 1871, Waldo M. Potter, of New York, an 
excellent man, a thoroughly trained and able writer and journalist, 
purchased a half interest in the paper, but did not 
remain with it long. The Tribune had been started in 1870 
by diseontentet Republicans, with Mr. C. B. Thomas as its 
editor, a New England gentleman of scholarly acquirements 
and rare ability as a writer of polished and forceful English, 
nis apprenticeship had been served on the Worcester 
Spy of Massachusetts, and he came to our newspaper life 
with the endorsement of Mr. Bowles of the Springfield Republican. 
The Tribune was started in January, 1870, and 
was absorbed by the Republican on June 11, 1871, by consolidation, 
Mr. Thomas disappearing from the Omaha life 
at about that time. I never knew what became of him. 

Mr. C. B. Thomas was actually brought here by Mr. E&lt; 
ward Hosewater during the peculiar gestation which gav 
birth to the Omaha Bee, who had already projected am 
named the coming new daily paper. He hailed from Dux 
bury, Massachusetts. Mr. Thomas was engaged to write fo 
the new Tribune, and a prospectus was published giving 
full statement of the greatness of the great coming edito 
from New England. But, for some reason not known to </seg>

this deponent, Mr. Thomas failed to arrive until the Be 
appeared on the scene and Mr. Rosewater had been installe( 
as its cd ; tor. The New Englander, when he did arrive, ca 
ried the scheme for the Tribune into Mother control. It Ice 
a brilliant but short life. Mr. Thomas was probably wha 
lovers of the ornate in style would call the best editoril 
writer who was ever among us. My own opinion was, and i 
that bis p!?.:n fault was the sacrifice of strength, which lies 
in clearness, to manifest efforts at what is called fine writin 
This, I take leave to say, and as the New York Sun demon 
strates, is not the best style for editorial writing. 

I In April, 1877, C. E. Yost secured a controlling interest 
the Republican, and afterwards Mr. Fred Nye, of Fremont 
gin and memory, was associated with Mr. Yost in the 
nersl.ip of the entire plant. Mr. Nye was the editor, and 
\ Yost the business manager, who brought to the paper 
e of the most capable and worthy of men. Mr. Nye is in 
icago. He is a versatile and able writer. Mr. Yost is now 
the head of the telephone company of Oi laha, where he 
s long resided as a citizen of the highest personal character. 

In 1886, Yost and Nye sold the paper to S. P. Hounds, 
merly of Chicago, and Cadet Taylor. The death of Mr. 
ands soon after actually destroyed the property, but it 
ught to Omaha Mr. O. H. Rothaker, whose reputation had 
ceded him through his great talents as a writer as disyed 
on the Denver press. In the style of slashing and 
rderous invective I never knew the equal of O. H. Both¦r. 
But I have inadvertently omitted mention in their 
iper order of such editors of the Republican as George 
Frost, who was a clergyman by education and profession, 
II. Barrows, the delightful ex-consul to Dublin, who is 
1 with us, Chauncey Wiltse, and D. C. Brooks. Mr. Frost 
il in Omaha many years ago. Mr. Wiltse is no more, but 
. Brooks is still among us, I trust, in his usual vigor of 
.lth and mind. He was, perhaps, as an all-round and 
ry day writer, scholarly, clear, and strong, as able a man </seg>

as was ever on the Omaha Republican. lie was highly educated, 
he was logical, liberal, and tolerant, and always a 
respectable and high-minded gentleman. The Republican 
went into the hands of a receiver in 1888. Receiver Yost 
managed the plant until December, 1889, when it was sold 
by him to Fred Nye and F. B. Johnson. Nye &amp; Johnson sold 
the paper to J. C. Wilcox, in 1890, upon whose hands, after 
a long and useful, but checkered life, it died the death that 
knows no wakening. 

The death of the tuberculous Omaha Xchrasl.ian in October, 
1SG5, marked the birth of the The Omaha Daily Herald. 
As chief accoucher, I tun able and willing to say that it 
was a very weak and puling infant. I in ij be allowed to add 
that it was born of a poor but reasonably respectable parentage, 
Daniel YV. Carpenter and George L. Miller b&lt; 
aolely responsible for its existence. Mr. Carpenter was an 
old expert in the practice of the art pro orvative of all arts, 
and had for years been honorably connected with the Council 
Bluffs Bugle. To the best of my knowledge and remembrance, 
Mr. Carpenter conceived the idea of the new paper. 
It began its twenty-throe years of life under the most primitive 
conditions. Facilities for publishing consisted of a small 
hand, press and a few cases of type, and the "circulation" at 
the start, I think, was represented by about fifty-three actual 
subscribers. George L. Miller was the editor, Mr. Carpenter 
the business manager, and both did something to get up what 
was then new to Omaha, a large spread of local news of 
that day. For the first few days Mr. Carpenter kept the 
books on slips of paper in a side pocket of his coat, which 
sometimes did duty as a cash-drawer with very little cash 
to cause him anxiety. Mr. John S. Briggs become part proprietor, 
buying out Mr. Carpenter; and within a short time 
thereafter Mr. Lyman Richardson, buying the Brigg3 interest, 
in turn, the firm became that of Miller &amp; Richardson, Mr. 
Richardson continuing as its business manager, Mr. Miller doing 
duty as the principal editorial writer for all those vears. </seg>

            <seg id="p047">

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

Mr. Richardson, a citizen of Omaha now, of the highest character 
and standing, who has resided there for forty-three 
years, did his whole part in bringing to the Herald whatever 
success attended its labors. The paper was sold to Hon. 
John A. McShane in 1888, and was subsequently sold by him 
to Mr. G. If. Hitchcock. The last of the editors of the old 
Herald was Frank Morrissey who, previous to the sale to 
Mr. McShane, had been associate editor of the paper. Mr. 
Morrissey was an educated man and an able writer. At his 
best, few in these parts equaled, and still fewer surpassed 
him in newspaper argument or controversy. He was especially 
strong upon economic questions. With as kind a heart 
as ever beat in human bosom, true to the Irish descent, he 
was impulsive and impetuous, and not always safe in adhering 
to a wise conduct of the paper. Mr. Morrissey was a 
native of Iowa and died in Omaha a few years ago. The 
Herald was merged into the Evening World by Mr. Hitchcock 
under the process of hyphenation, which leaves it with 
the name of the World-Herald. It did not die, exactly, which, 
for several reasons, is to be deeply regretted, but was, and is, 
somewhat painfully suffocated in more ways than I care to 
enumerate. 

I am fully conscious of how inadequate this paper is in 
respect to the large subject which it has undertaken to discuss. 
Its narrow scope has made it impracticable to deal 
with all of those veterans of the press of the territorial times 
who did so much to mould into form and lead into a marvelous 
development this great community, which occupies so 
proud a place in the sisterhood of the Union. Furnas, th 
father of Nebraska horticulture, and the life-long promote 
of our agricultural advancement, with his own Advertiser 
and otherwise, has won for himself enduring honor, and a 
name which will never be erased from the written annals o 
the State; Charles H. Gere, the gentleman, the scholar, th 
able and finished writer, who has given the strength of permanence 
and wide influence to the State Journal; J. D. Cal- </seg>

I undertake to demonstrate by a figurative illustration o! 
t has transpired a number of times over, under the obser 
on of the writer in Nebraska since he has been a squatter 
(reign, now since October, 1854. 

A few enterprising pioneers get together, and arrive at 
the conclusion that right here (naming some point) is to 
rise a Mighty City, visionary or otherwise, and the more they 
think of it the more enthusiastic they become, until their 
minds become infatuated that there are Millions in it. Bu 
the next question that perplexes the town-owners is how to 
"boom the town." Why, of course we must have a newspaper 
But here comes the rub. How are we to get one? There is 
not money enough among the stockholders, singly or collect 
ively, to purchase a printing outfit, but that question is 
soon solved, for soon you will see a very beautifully execute* 
lithograph of a new town in Nebraska — it looks grand am 
magnificent on paper — it is to be the great commercial am 
railroad center of the State. Fine, very fine. It catche 
the eye of the eastern investor in western lots. A few suckers 
invest in western "gold bricks," and at last a sufficien 
amount of money is raised to purchase the necexsirv equipment 
for a small printing office. A college-bred tenderfoo 
drops in just in time to secure the editorship. What he don' 
know about running a printing office is not worth knowing 
he is j'oung and ambitious, he desires to distinguish himsel

COMMUNICATION OF HADLEY D. JOHNSON. 

Salt Lake City Utah, 

To the President and Members of the Nebraska Historical 

Society : 

Gentlemen — I have lately received two letters from Mr. 
J. A. Barrett, your librarian, in each of which I am asked 
to attend the annual meeting of the Society on the 11th day of 
January and to relate some reminiscences of the early days 
in Nebraska, or, if I should not be able to attend in person, 
I am requested to write and forward some recollections of 
those times to be read at such meeting. 

Eving found it to be impracticable for me to attend in 
n, I so notified Mr. Barrett and suggested that I would 
ibly comply with the alternative request. 

I assure you that it was with much regret that I was compelled 
to make the announcement that I could not attend in 
person, for the reason that I would be exceedingly glad to 
meet such of your members as may be present, and especially 
those whom I have known in the past, and not less pleased 
to form the acquaintance of those whom I do not know. 

I Inasmuch as I have already furnished the Society an acunt 
of events preceding the organization of the Territory 
ee vol. 2 of Reports of the Society), and from the fact that 
e histories of Omaha and Nebraska have heretofore been 
blished, it is not likely that I shall be able to relate many 
¦idents which will be either new or interesting to you.

PUBLIC PRIXTEB. 

At the second session of the legislature of Nebraska, in 
1855-56, I was elected territorial printer, and, not being in 
possession of a plant with which to do the incidental printing 
during the session, I purchased from Col. Peter A. Sarpy, the </seg>

Indian trader at Bellevue, tlie press and other material upo 
which the I'lilladinm and tlie "(Jazcttc" had been printed. S 
n as this plant was hauled to Omaha I commenced to d 
the printing of bills, resolutions, and other work, and also 
roounenced tlie publication of the "Nebraska Democrat ," bu 
¦lutinued its publication temporarily during the time 
was ;ibsent in the East (at Indianapolis) where I superin 
tocded the printing of the laws and journals of the house 
and council. 

Il'lie publication of the Democrat, however, was afterwan 
tuned and its columns devoted to the advocacy of th 
iins of Buchanan to the presidency. When the election 
s over the publication of that paper was discontinued am 
prew and materials afterwards sold to Mr. S. M. Owens 
;en to riorer.ee, where the Courier was printed for a shor 
ie (1 have forgotten the name of its editor). The plant, 
nk, was removed elsewhere and some other newspape

I Inasmuch as Mr. Joseph Ellis Johnson, late editor and 
blirtcr of the Council Bluffs Bugle, and various other pubations 
(a list of which he himself has furnished), took 
somewhat prominent part in the initiatory movements to 
y out the Indians and open for white settlement a portion 
the wilds of Nebraska, and subsequently took an active 
rt in the development of the same, I think it proper that he 
ou!d receive deserved recognition as a pioneer of the state

t Omaha, has also given Mr. Johnson considerable promiice, 
and I believe that I gave him credit for good work 
Nebraska in a former communication to the Society. I 
:e occasion to state, however, that Mr. Sorenson in his 
ice of the Omaha Arrow gave less credit than was deserved 
Mr. Johnson. 

[Foseph E. Johnson was the owner, editor, and publisher o 
Arrow, and J. M. Pattison the reporter and assistan 
tor. Mr. Johnson was a pioneer, a rustler, and a ma 
business. Pattison was a popular young man and 
der-foot who retired to older parts after a short stay i 
v Nebraska. Johnson wrote the "dream" (spoken of b 
renson as Pattison's effort). He foresaw, as we all di 
those days, a brilliant future for Nebraska, as well as 
er realities which are not dreams, but facts, such as rai 
ds without number, etc. 

THE BATTLE AT FOBT CALHOUN, 

One of the most unfortunate events attending the settlement 
of the territory occurred at Kort Calhoun in 1855. 
do not believe, although the matter has been canvassed am 
talked about for more than forty years, that the true cause 
of the trouble has ever been understood. Let me claim in 
dulgence for a brief statement of the facts which I, as a 
spectator, know them to be. 

In 1855, Sherman Goss, a farmer living in Iowa opposite 
the site of old Fort Calhoun, and his son John, took possession 
of the site, intending to lay off a town, and invited me to 
join them, which 1 did, and employed a kind hearted and 
competent surveyor, Col. Lorin Miller (father of my old 
friend, Dr. G. L. Miller), to survey and plat the town, which 
he accomplished, and did it well. 

In order to hold possession, I caused to be built on the 
site a log cabin, and permitted Dr. William Moore to occupy 
it with his family until he could erect a house on his own 
claim on Moore's creek. After his removal and before I </seg>

could put another party in possession, one Charles Davis 
moved his family into the house and made known his intention 
to jump the town site, and, when asked to do so, refused 
to leave the place, and proceeded to fortify the same, and, 
expecting to be ousted, collected a number of men to come 
to his defense, and a number of persons collected at the 
place hoping by a compromise to induce him to leave, while 
I, being outside of the building, talking with P. C. Sullivan 
(late speaker of the house of representatives), with a view, 
as he was a friend and advisor of Davis, of coming to some 
agreement. While we were in conversation at one corner of 
the building, out of reach of balls from the door, some parties 
on the inside opened fire on our party (which had formed in 
a semi-circle in front of the house), instantly killing Sherman 
Goss and breaking an arm of H. C. Purple. Other members 
of the party, being thus exposed, retreated, leaving Goss dead 
on the ground and Sullivan and myself still outside, but out 
of reach of the guns of the inside party. 

My party having dispersed, I said to Sullivan, "Now I 
will go to my team, and as I go don't let those men shoot 
me." However, so soon as I had started and had walked 
some twenty feet, firing on me commenced and continued as I 
walked until I think all guns were unloaded. At the time I 
did not believe that they intended to kill, but merely to 
frighten and cause me to run, but it was afterwards given 
out that it was intended to kill the Gosses and myself, thus 
giving the jumper a clear field. I will say that, but for my 
objection, the citizens of the surrounding country would certainly 
have made war on the jumpers, but I would not consent. 
It was thus that I "speculated" in Fort Calhoun city 
lots. I lost all money invested, and quit-claimed one-half my 
interest to the widow of Goss and the other half to Mr. 

tin 1864, while at Boise City, Idaho, Charles Davis and anler 
man with their families camped on the townsite at that 
w town, and it soon became suspected that their designs </seg>

ire to jump some lots. Learning these facts I said to Davis, 
he people here think you are on the jump again. If you 
1 your friend desire to stop here and build houses, I will 
e each of you a lot, as I own some lots and am agent for 
lers, but there must be no attempts to jump lots here — 
¦se people will not stand it." They did not accept any

AT OLD FOKT KEARNEY, 

When it was decided by our friends that I must go to 
Washington and make the attempt to get the government to 
buy out the Indians, open the Nebraska prairies to settlement, 
and to organize a territorial government, it was 
thought that, as I then resided in Iowa, it would be better 
for me to claim at least a temporary residence west of the 
Missouri river, and, as the whites were not permitted to live 
in Indian territory, except at military posts, I decided that 
old Fort Kearney should be nominally, at least, my residence. 

To carry out this plan I mounted my horse and made my 
way to Sidney, Fremont county, where I met Hon. A. A. 
Bradford and Mr. Charles W. Pierce, who accompanied me 
to Fort Kearney by way of a point at which the town of Hamburg 
was afterwards located. At this place we located (in 
our minds) the town and I believe the junction of two 

Leaving this point, we wended our way across the wide 
expanse of rich bottom land to a place some distance south 
of the Fort, where a flat boat was owned and managed by a 
gentleman well known then, but whose name I have forgotten. 
Crossing the river on this boat we took the emigrant road 
which brought us to near the Fort, which place, if I remember, 
we reached during the night — weary, wet, and hungry. 

EiVhile at the Fort, under advice, I laid claim to 160 acres 
land lying south and adjoining the old government lime </seg>

kiln. It was not staked out, but it was understood to be my 
claim, and it was my intention to make my house there if we 
succeeded in opening the country to settlement. Ilowever, 
in this matter I was doomed to disappointment. Some person 
during my absence at Washington jumped my claim, 
which, I have no doubt, was one reason why I failed to become 
a citizen of Nebraska City and a near neighbor to my 
old friend, J. Sterling Morton, who was then a young man. 

f&gt;n my return from Washington, finding my claim taken 
another, I looked over the ground at Omaha where I 
nd that everything thought to be valuable had been 
bbled up," and I was again relegated to the outer world, 
I only secured a foothold by the purchase of a claim three 
es from the town. I will mention here a fact which may 
;e to show how appreciative some people are of the disin?sted 
acts of some other fellow. 

I. had neglected my business, spent all the money I ha&lt; 
1 could borrow (and had been assisted by my neighbors i 
sum of $46), had obtained the consent of the India 
)artment for the Omaha Town Company to take posses 
n of the site, and that company, though giving away lots 
great value to non-residents, never offered to give or se 
y property to me, and when I wanted a lot I was obliged t

tions on the route. I do not remember whether any postoffice 
had been established any further north than Sioux 
Pity, though possibly there was one a few miles beyond. 
While running this line I was obliged to obtain my grain to 
ftcd my stock at Omaha, paying usually three cents per 
pound for oats and carry sufficient each trip to feed the stock 
on the line. During a part of the time there was a good deal 
of travel from which I derived some profit. 

During the time I was thus engaged, I had the honor as 
well as pleasure of having as a passenger from Omaha to 
Nebraska City the distinguished civilian and politician, Governor 
Orr, of the state of South Carolina. On this occasion 
I became a Stage driver, and, as his "Jehu," drove him down 
to the Platte river, occupying my private carriage drawn by 
my matched horses. 

Well! Well! How times do change! The Governor is no 
more, his southern confederacy has become an institution of 
the past ; my horses are dead ; my carriage went up in the 

smoke of a burning hay stack, but I, who ought long since 
to have been gathered to my fathers, remain to record these 
simple tales. 

Here let me pause and inquire, Why am I allowed to remain 
"a cumberer of the ground?" Looking over the past 
and seeing a list of names of men who, with me, were engaged 
in the laudable business of "state building," and observing 
how much so many of them have accomplished, and are now 
alive only in the hearts of the people, while I, who am alive 
and in the flesh, have accomplished so little, often wonder 
why it is so. 

And now, gentlemen, having thus consumed your time in 
rehearsing these, perhaps uninteresting, stories of the past. 
I bid you adieu. Should life and a degree of health permit, 
I may possibly meet with you on some future occasion, perhaps 
at your great exposition, but the infirmities of a life

JOSEPH L. SriARP. 

Ehe President of the Society, Mr. Morton, cave the followitem 
during the evening of January 11, 1898 : 

|[t occurs to me to state that the men who took an activ 
rt in the early journalism of Nebraska were not, as a rule 
n of college education. Nevertheless, they were men o 
¦n satire and humor. I wish to call to your minds an 
?cdote relative to Mr. Joseph L. Sharp and Mr. Thoma 
tchell. Mr. Sharp was the editor of a newspaper. Befor 
uing to Nebraska he had been a member of the legislature 
Illinois and Iowa, and finally had been chosen a membe 
the Nebraska legislature. There was great rivalry be 
?en Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Sharp as to which should be 
¦sident of the first territorial legislature. 

Mr. Sharp was a very peculiar looking man; was tall an&lt; 
gaunt, and had been afflicted with the smallpox, which hac 
left strange looking marks on his face. His face looked a 
though it had been scalded. As to his facial expression, i 
was always askew. However, he won in the contest betwee 
himself and Mr. Mitchell. Sometime after, two strangers 
were standing near Mr. Mitchell's seat listening to M 
Sharp's decisions, which were always to the point. One o 
the strangers said, "What an awfully homely man! But 1 
decides pretty well. His knowledge of parliamentary law 
good." "Yes," said the other, "But he looks like the dev 
himself." Mr. Mitchell, who had overheard the conversation 
said, "Yes, he looks pretty bad now; but you ought to hav 
seen him before he had the smallpox." </seg>

R. W. Furnas gare the following concerning A. J. Hanscom. 

Being called upon to take part in this discussion to-night 
reminds me of an anecdote about A. J. Hanscom. In the 
early territorial days he was a candidate for some office, I 
think for a member of the legislature. He was around hunting 
friends, and engaged a man who was to support him, as 
he supposed, upon simply a promise that "he guessed he 
would support him." After the election was over, Mr. Hanscom 
found that he had not supported him, and when Mr. 
Hanscom asked him to explain replied, "Hanscom, I told you 
that I guessed I would support you, and I was always a very 
poor guesser." Your secretary solicited me some time ago 
to take part in this program, and I replied that "I guessed I 
would," and the facts prove that I, too, was a very poor 
guesser. I have not had time to prepare anything for this 
occasion. The papers by Mr. Morton and Dr. Miller have 
brought to me recollections of the early struggles of the 
pioneer journalists of Nebraska. I remember that on the 
sixth day of April, 1856, I stepped from the steamboat 
J. H. Lucas, which has already been mentioned here to-night. 
I had but 18$ cents in my pocket. There were but three or 
four log houses in Brown ville at that time. I undertook the 
publication of a newspaper there, and, notwithstanding all 
the annoyances and discouragements I had to contend with, 
those were the happiest days I think I have ever enjoyed in 
Nebraska. Not that the remuneration was much. One instance 
I remember very well. One man had subscribed for 
twenty-five copies of the paper. When I asked him to pay up 
he said, "Why, you didn't expect me to pay for twenty-five 
copies, did you? I simply subscribed to encourage the

REMINISCENCES OF TERRITORIAL DAYS. 

Written by Dr F. Renner for the session of the Historical Society on January 

11. 1818. 

In the winter of 18G0-61, some twenty prominent German- 
An.jrcan citizens of Nebraska City held a series of meetings 
f r the purpose of ushering into existence a weekly paper 
tc; be published in the German language, which finally took 
pe by the adoption of a constitution and bv-laws, the subscription 
of one hundred shares at $5 each to the Nebraska 
Zcitungs (Jcscllschaft (Journal or Gazette Company), and 
the election of officers. 

ilt can not be truthfully asserted that the motives of th 
tfeholden were either personal, clannish, local, or polit 
!, for none of them was a real estate agent, or owned mor 
ivn lots than he needed for his business, his residence, an&lt; 
rkaps a garden spot. None of them was a candidate fo 
ice or had a friend that was, but they considered it tl 
oj:er moment to circulate everywhere the glad tidings of 
w, extensive territory where the best land under the su 
u!d be had for the government price of f 1.25 an acre, ant 
i3re the great need was farmers, laborers, mechanics, ca 
ilists, and railroads, or other means of rapid transporta 
m, in order to make it a desirable home for any white ma 

I As the majority of stockholders was made up of democrats, 
e constitution of the Zcitungs company provided that the 
ibryo paper should be "neutral in politics," that it should 
ave n&lt;;th,ng to do with questions of slavery, state policy, 
id sivtarian creeds which agitate and convulse the Union, 
parate men from each other, and array them in antagonistic 
rces and factions." 

K However, the old proverb proved true: "Man proposes, 
t God disposes." Little did we think in March, 1861, that </seg>

in a few weeks we would be afflicted with the miseries of the 
gre test civil war the world ever saw, that the old p.irty liae 
would be wiped out, and that we all would stand bound to 
gether in common and unceasing effort for the salvation of 
our common country. 

iBy March 1, 1861, all shares were taken and paid up; hence 
e stockholders proceeded to the election of officers. As 
esident, was chosen that pioneer merchant of South Neaska, 
B. H. Kalkman, as largest stockholder (+1864), as 
?asurer Frederick Beyschlag (+1896), whose memories will 
rever be revered by all who have known their amiable 
aracters and many virtues. As secretary, editor, business 
mager, in fact, as factotem, your humble servant and 
lator. No doubt I was selected for this position because 
reral articles from my pen about Nebraska and its reurces 
had been extensively copied by eastern newspapers 
large circulation. 

I In accepting the position without salary and without any 
;ntal or expressed reservation, I made the grossest mistake 
my life, financially speaking, for by attending exclusively 
my profession I could have made considerable money; but 
ivas completely heedless and ignorant of the endless hard 
&gt;rk of a publisher and editor, which would absorb nearly 
the time and attention of an inexperienced man. 

Without much loss of time we ordered the necessary types 
and other material (with the exception of a press from Cin 
cinnati), and by the courtesy of Dr. Praetorius of th 
Wcstlichc Post in St. Louis we succeeded in securing th 
services of two very good printers at the rate of f 15 per wee 
and traveling expenses, who arrived just a day or two afte 

Ey faithful and extra work, we were enabled on Thursday, 
il 4, 1861, to lock the forms of number 1, volume 1, of the

elbarrow to the office of the Nebraska City Xctcs, where 
veteran printer, Thomas ilorton, had agreed to do our </seg>

press work. Thus made the first paper in Nebraska, printed 
in a foreign language, its appearance. It was a seven column 
folio, and with its new type clear through, a niarrelously 
neat paper — our first born, you know — and nobody understood 
the art of printing better than Thomas Morton, although 
at that time, if I remember correctly, he used a hand 
press so old that I never saw one like it in any museum. 

I?he "head" of the Nebraska Deutsche Zeitung had been or 
ed electrotyped in three sections, with a fourth extra sec 
n entitled "Staats," so that I could simply slip the "State 
the place of "Deutsche" as soon as Nebraska should b 
nitted to statehood, for we did not imagine that it woul&lt; 
uire six years of bitter political contest before Nebrask 
ild turn the sharp corner from territorial dependency t 
te sovereignty, and enter the proud galaxy of fixed stars 
the firmament of the American Union. 

Irhe first and most of the subsequent numbers of tl 
tnng presumably met public expectation, as its severa 
aes gave what little local intelligence there was; but th 
leral news, including the latest dispatches, translated prin 
ally from the St. Joe and St. Louis papers, were gainin 
re interest from day to day. On the twelfth day of Apri 
Confederates commenced the bombardment of Ft. Sum 
; the tocsin of civil war and insurrection was sounded i 
ry state and territory, when American hands, guided b 
•lessness of treason, were reached forth here and there am 
rywhere to pull down the tall pillars which supportec 
• once glorious Union. At the same time, we never los 
ht of our main object, which was to induce immigratio 
Nebraska. 

Ehe circulation of the Zeitung was from the beginning, com•atively 
speaking, a very large one, about half a bundle, 
the reason that many, especially the stockholders, subibed 
for five to twenty-five copies. About 150 were reguly 
mailed to Europe, to-wit: Germany, Australia, Switzerd, 
and the German-speaking provinces Alsace and Lor- </seg>

py. A goodly number of subscribers resided in the eaststates, 
and on our mail list was represented almost every 
:offiee in the settled counties. As business in Nebraska 
commencing to boom, the advertising patronage was very 
raraging as a general thing; but in the case of the sharelers 
of the Zeitungs company it was quite the reverse, 
y insisted on paying for their ads with shares instead of 
i, which — as everybody ought to know — is a very neces' 
commodity at the start of any enterprise. 

IAjb may be expected, the private exchequer of the secretary 
d editor of the Zeitungs company was drained quite low 
times by this unexpected quandary ; yet, on the other hand, 
gave him the satisfaction that in less than six months he 
ii the sole and exclusive control of the whole concern, was 
i own boss, so to speak, and he was no longer subject to 
•tation in relation to "politics, religion, or previous condin 
of servitude," 

The office of the Zeitung was opposite the old Fort Kearney 
over the old store building of Chas. Vogt, on the corner 
of 5th and Main Sts., who had generously offered us the capacious, 
but un plastered rooms free of rent. When, in pursuance 
of the Governor's proclamation, a company of soldiers 
was raised in Nebraska City, intended chiefly for the 
protection of Nebraska against the incursions of the secessionists, 
and also to impose a salutary restraint upon the Otoe 
Indians, who occupied a reservation hard by and might take 
advantage of the unsettled state of affairs to commit depredations, 
the place of enlistment was in the old fort The fife 
and drum alternated with stirring war discourses from early

— and what was my surprise on the morning of June 10 when

who had received orders to rendezvous with his company at 
Omaha on the loth of June, in order to get mustered into 
the service of Uncle Sam — at the rate of $ 13 a month. 

This dose of patriotism was not exactly to my taste, but 
had to grin and bear it. I said to myself with Milton, "Sti 
bear up, and steer right onward!" I persuaded the new recruits 
to stay and help me get out the next issue, which the 
did. I telegraphed at once to St. Louis for two other comp 
but with the proviso that they should be lame or otherwis 
disabled from military service. By next mail I received a le 
ter from my friend, informing me that my men were on th 
road, one with a wooden leg and the other rather near-sighte&lt; 
but that my proviso had been absolutely unnecessary, ina 
much as no able-bodied German printers, out of work, wer 
to be found in St. Louis. All Germans there were recogniz 
ing the extent of the conflict thus forced by the slave-holders 
upon the nation; all were enlisted, or arming and drilling fo 
the defence of the star-spangled banner, and none so lost t 
all sense of honor and integrity as to take voluntarily th 
part of traitors. 

I[ had several cases afterwards, when my workmen left m 
the lurch and other help could not be obtained so readil 
the aid of friends and the telegraph. Some took sic 
Idenly, another went on irregular sprees, which was th 
re embarrassing, as the patent insides and stereotype 
tes were not invented as yet. Many times I came to th 
iclusion that running a newspaper was harder work tha 
ring a boat up-stream. A man may pull his boat slowl 
tinst the current, if he works steadily, but the publishe

En in any other there is a constant danger of interruptions 
obstructions, eddies and sandbars, which call for more 
•k, for harder pulling at the oars. 

More than once I was obliged to call upon the Neics or 
the Press to help me out of a difficulty by sparing me their 
foreman to make up my forms or a typo to set up an item or 
two for me that absolutely had to go into a certain issue. 
On such occasions I had to stand right by, as my kind volunteers 
understood not a word of German, in order to give the 
necessary directions or to dictate separately each letter, 
space, interpunctuation, etc. Such work required much patience 
from both of us, but you know that "patience is the 
virtue of an ass, that treads beneath his burden and is quiet." 
It is a fact that even during the trying war times the utmost 
harmony, or at least courtesy, prevailed among the newspaper 
fraternity in Nebraska City at least, and I take this 
occasion to express my thanks to the survivors and my tribute 
to the dead for past favors. The agreeable intercourse which 
existed between ourselves will form a pleasant recollection to 
the end of my days. 

The first day of January, 18G3, marked one of the most 
important periods in the history and development of our 
territory, for on that day the Homestead Law went into 
effect, and under its most liberal provisions not only a citizen 
of the United States, but also every person, the head of a 
family or over the age of twenty-one years, who had merely 
declared hix intention to become such, had the right to take 
up a homestead of 1G0 acres on any public lands. It goes 
without saying that the Zeitung did its level best to spread as 
quickly as possible the glorious news to the farmer boys of 
the eastern states as well as in Europe, that millions of fertile 
acres of the public domain in Nebraska were lying open 
for selection; and, for anyone who acknowledged his intention 
to settle and cultivate the same permanently, there was 
a farm of 160 acres for the paltry sum of f 14, as fees for 
recording and registration.

The Zcititng invited everybody to Nebraska, to the "land o 
the free, where the mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea 
where a man is a man if he's willing to toil, and the humbles 
may gather the fruits of the soil." We considered it one o 
our most important duties as pioneers of a new country t 
advance our settlements and secure a fringe of pioneer de 
velopments along our western border. We did what w 
could to bring forward to Nebraska the approaching lines ( 
immigration and press forward the advancing thousands th: 
heretofore had stopped east of the Mississippi. From wee 
to week the Zcitung brought one or more leading articles am 
a number of smaller but spicy items, all calculated to mak 
an everworking, noiseless, but effective propaganda in favo 
of immigration to Nebraska and more especially to the Sout 
Platte land districts, in which the editor of the Zcitung wa 
more or less acquainted ; for in the summer months of 185 
and 1858 he had, with General Calhoun, Col. Manners, an 
their surveying parties, traversed the entire southern boun 
dary line of the newly established territory, beginning at 
point on the Missouri river, where the 4fith parallel of nort 
latitude crosses the same; thence west on the said paralle 
to the east boundary of the territory of Utah, on the smnm 
of the Rocky mountains. On these two extended trips, an 
years before Colorado was created out of a part of Nebrask 
and Utah, I had ample opportunity to observe the rich vallej 
of the Republican and the Platte with their tributaries am 
to make a reconnaissance of the country adjacent, keepin 
field notes of the topography, soils, climate, healthfulness, a 
well as of all the resources and conditions of Nebraska. 

This experience, together with the cooperation of a nunibi' 
of highly educated gentlemen in several counties, enablet 
us to carry on an active and intelligent discussion of th 
best locations, by describing and illustrating the differen 
counties and settlements and their special resources in regarc 
to various industrial and agricultural pursuits.

iril, 1865, we made this point quite prominent that, while 
ler states and territories (meaning principally our neighrs 
of Missouri and Kansas) had been torn by internal disisions, 
their soil overrun and desecrated by border ruffians,

and civil war around us, peace and good order, practical 
pr, and manly observance of the laws and constitutional 
ligations had characterized the conduct of our Nebraska 

I In 1866 Colonel Orsemus H. Irish, who had established the 
topic's Press in 1858, but sold out in 1860 to Alfred Mathias 
d Joseph E. Lamaster, again took charge of the Press as 
itor and publisher. In October of the same year the Colonel 
oposed to me a union with the Press and a limited partrahip 
under the name and style of O. H. Irish &amp; Dr. F. 
&gt;nner, which relieved me from all the mechanical and office 
&gt;rk connected with the Deutsche Zeitung, and I could dete 
all my spare time to the editorial department. At first 
was the idea of Col. Irish that one-half of the paper should 
published in the English and the other half in the German 
aguage, and the German portion of the paper should be 
creased from time to time "as the patronage received from 
r German fellow citizens would warrant." I had no faith 
this polyglot or hermaphrodite scheme, and after half a 
ten issues the Colonel had to give it up, as a majority of 
s Germans, as well as of Americans, wanted to pay only 
e-half of the subscription price, because they could not 
id the other half.

and statesmanship of that party which carried us tr 
umphantly through the perils of the recent past; yet th 
Zcitimg continued as heretofore to cultivate and promote a 
all times the spirit of reconciliation even against former lead 
ing rebels, the great advantages whereof were so clearly ex 
emplified since the foundation and by the rapid growth o 
our publication. 

We patiently waited for our financial success and hoped 
courageously that the time for the fruit of our labors to 
ripen would come with the admission of Nebraska to our 
glorious Union. 

"Hope springs eternal in the human breast; 

Man never is, but always to be blest; 

The soul, uneasy and confined from home, 
llests and expatiates on a life to come." 

i)n the first day of March, 1867, Nebraska was finally made 
tate by proclamation of President Andrew Johnson, and 
the same date the name of Nebraska Deutsche Zcitung, 
contemplated at its foundation in 1861, was transformed 
Nebraska Staatx Zcitung. 

After the election of General Grant as president our partner, 
Col. Irish, was appointed consul to Dresden in Germany, 
and of course withdrew from the Press as well as from the

Presented to the Society by W. W. Cox at the Session of the Historical Society 
January 11, 1899. 

I Indian nomenclature has given us many euphonious names, 
t the people have had some desperate struggles in deterining 
the proper pronunciation of many of them. 

ffhe world had just taken a short rest after settling down 
&gt;n the best way to pronounce the name of the queen city 
the Lakes. 

It is somewhat amusing to the younger people to know 
just what a time we older people had with these jaw-breakin 
names. We had Chdkago, Checa-go Chicago, Chi-cago, an( 
most every possible pronunciation except the right one. Th 
time of our adventure, school boys and many old boys were 
wrestling with the beautiful name of our metropolis. Th 
contention was for Otnd/id, ~Omihi, Omaha, Omdhd, Omahi 
and we have heard the name pronounced O-my-hog. 

This was before the great cluiractcr of the nineteenth cen 
tury had yet secured a place high over all for his name in th 
scroll bearing the world's most illustrious names. It wa 
long years before this great and busy city bearing his iiu 
mortal name had even been dreamed of. It was long befor 
an iron rail had been laid in all the trans-Missouri country 
even to the shores of the great Pacific. It was long before 
a shovel of dirt had been moved in preparation of the grea 
artery of the world's commerce, the U. P. Ky. It was whe 
millions upon millions of buffalo were roaming at will ove 
all the region now covered witli farms, towns, and citiec wes 
ward of Blue river, and when there were not to exceed 
half dozen cabins between Salt creek valley and Gram 
Island settlement. It was when but two trails crossed th 
land now covered by the city of Lincoln. 

The principal trail led from the Great Basin (Burlington 
Beach) eastward to the Salt creek ford, just by the mouth of

the South Platte delegates were to meet, and there take 
steamer and take our chances stemming the tortuous curren 
of "Old Muddy"' to Omaha. It took near two days of ol

Nomaha, not far from the site of Unadilla. Near the site 
of Syracuse, Mrs. McKee, a widow lady, and two of her 
sons had what was, at the time, considered an elegant home. 
They were the proud possessors of the only frame house 
west of the Majors farm, in all the wilderness roundabout. 
The ancient, eccentric, and only James Her lived in the 
same immediate vicinity. A Mr. Wilson lived eight 
miles west of the city, on a little creek of his own 
naming. These comprised the only improvements on 
the way till we reached the far-famed farm of Alexander 
Majors, four miles out of the city. To the thoughtful 
there were many things of interest, many things to admire 
and to instruct. There was to me something inspiring about 
tliir "wild and woolly west." In its native grandeur these 
rolling hills, clothed with their waving mantle of green, very 
much rambled the rolling waves of old ocean. Away on 
yonder hill could be seen the gay antelope, sporting its white 
tail and cantering in a wide circle around us, trying to discover 
what we were after. This little animal is most bewitchingly 
beautiful, with head erect and white plume in th 
rear. So fleet of foot, so full of pranks, it was admire&lt; 
above all animals of the plains. Now we discover on th 
distant elevation, a herd of those grandly majestic elk, a 
they snuff danger from the breezes, and are led by a grea 
fctag whose horns make him conspicuous. The earth fairl 
trembles beneath their tread as they seek safety in rapid 
fl'ght. Once in a while a city of prairie dogs would be seen, 
where much sport could be indulged in, listening to their 
shrill little barking. This little creature, just a size larger 
liian the common rat, would sit by its hole, on a little mound 
of its own creation, and bark lustily (thousands of them 
would be at it all at once). When Mr. Dog concluded that 
you were getting too near for his safety, he would shake his 
tail about as quick as lightning and dart into his hole. If 
the dog gets crippled or killed by a shot (which is very rare), 
others come to the rescue and take it into the hole so quickly </seg>

that it is next to impossible to capture one dead or alive 
If you can imagine how a common dog barking through 
telephone would sound, then you have about the bark of th 
front prairie dog. An occasional jack-rabbit would juni 
up in front of us and try to make believe he was badl 
crippled, but he \\ is playing on us "you know."' Flock 
of prairie chickens would frequently awaken us from on 
reverie. Away yonder to the right could be seen a lonel 
coyote, sitting on his haunches, waiting and watching. W 
reached the city, weary and covered with dust, but it \va 
cheering to meet such a cordial welcome. Nebraska Cit 
had a quite prominent aspirant for congressional honors 
Of course he wanted votes, and it did not take him long t 
learn that the "gentlemen from Lancaster" had arrived. Th 
fat of the land was at our disposal "without money an&lt; 
without price," aud, were we not strictly temperate, we migh 
add that the drinks of the land were within easy reach. 1 
is well here to note, that both party conventions were set fo 
the same day at Omaha, so that when we "black republicans 
i as our democratic friends were pleased to call us in those 
good old days) boarded the little steamer, we found a mixe&lt; 
company made up of prominent democrats and leading re 
publicans of the South IMatte country. Among the compan 
were three aspirants for congressional honors. Win. Tayloi 
of Nebraska City, was ready and anxious to be sacrifice* 
as a republican candidate, and Judge Kinney, also of Nebraska 
City, desired to lead the democratic host to victory 
or death ; and Samuel G. Dorr, of Nemaha county. 

We may here note that our man Taylor got kuocked out 
at Omaha, where the distinguished judge had an easy victory, 
only to get badly left at the ballot box. Some men known 
to fame in later days were with us that memorable night 
Among the uuniber was lion. O. P. Mason, later a chief 
justice; the Sage Arbor Lodge, our honorable President; 
Gov. Robert W. Furnas, editor Brownville Adccrtiser; J.

brother; Wallace Pearman, our late and most distinguished 
squatter governor; Wm. E. Hill; Win. L. Boydston; Win. 
McClennan; Milton W. Reynolds, editor Nebraska City 
Newt; Aug. F. Harnev (Ajax) ; Elmer S. Duudy, late judge 
of this Federal district; David Butler, first governor of the 
State; Dr. J. F. Keuner, our eccentric German friend. Frequently 
there is a deeper, yes, deadlier, feeling of antagonism 
between aspiring members of the same party than can be 
found between members of opposing parlies, and here was a 
rase in point. There was a Peruvian of mu h renown and 
great political acumen, as my distinguished friend Morton 
will readily bear me witness. His name was Samuel G. Daily, 
and we opine that he was about the brightest edition of a 
daily that Nebraska has yet produced. Mr. Daily was the 
man that broke the democratic ice in Nebraska. It will be 
remembered by all old timers that the Territory was organized 
under democratic rule, and all officers, from governor to 
road supervisors, were democratic prior to 1880, when Mr. 
Daily contested with our honored President, lion. J. Sterling 
Morton, for congressional honors. This spirited contest was 
carried from Nebraska to the halls of Congress, where Mr. 
Daily succeeded, to the discomfiture of the democratic host, 
who were never again able to secure a representative in Congress 
for thirty years from this territory or state. Mr. Daily 
had made a record for himself, but in doing this he had inadvertently 
trodden on the corns of some other good republicans, 
like Oliver P. Mason, T. M. Marquette, and others too 
numerous to mention, and they were after the Peruvians 
scalp. It may be surprising to many, but it is verily true, 
that there were quite a goodly number of patriots in each 
Pty willing to go to Congress, although the pay was only 
f what it now is. Mason wanted to go. Marquette had 
irations. Phineas W. Hitchcock could have been induct.!

t. Wm. Taylor had the lead, however, of all in opposition 
Mr. Daily. 

I^he little river steamer on that eventful night was the 
ae of great political animation. Democrats were plotting 
inst democrats, and republicans were scheming to down 
ir political brethren. When our party boarded the steamer 
found the southern clan from Nemaha, Richardson, ami 
er extreme southern counties, already quite at home, 
h plans fairly well perfected, and prepared to face the 
toe chief Taylor with a solid front of Peruvians, ready 
battle. Here were such notables as R. W. Furnas, David 
tier, and the two Dailys in the one group planning for the 
lp of our Otoe chief. 

Taylor's men soon found a corner where such l&gt;ra\ 
Mason, Pearman, Seymour, Dr. Kenner, and others, led by 
Taylor, were counting noses and giving each other words 
of encouragement to dare and do valiant service in downing 
the hateful Peruvian. Over in another corner might be seen 
the democratic worthies, Morton, Kinney, Harney, Reynolds, 
McLennan, Hawke, NuckoUs, and others, figuring over the 
vexed problem as to how they could scalp Dr. Geo. L. Miller 
and Editor Robertson of the ancient Xebraakian. 

I Being weary from the long march across the hills, and 
w weary of this pettifogging, we were induced by sheer 
haustion to retire at about midnight, little thinking that 
&gt;m this harmless din and clatter such horrors should meet 
with the morning light. 

In the small hours of the night the steamer hove-to at the 
l'lattsmouth levee, and quite a large delegation for each 
convention came on board. Some were overflowing with 
democratic zeal, many were full of aid-time republican enthusiasm, 
and many were well filled up witli "tangle-foot."

others came on board, and among the number was a brave

anee, and the meeting partook of the nature of a love-feast, 
but suddenly the Colonel disappeared from sight. As soon 
as he was missed a search begaa, and you may, if possible, 
imagine the consternation when it became certain that the 
Colonel had fallen overboard. No pen can write it; no 
tongue can tell it. Just whea or just how it occurred will 
never be known till the judgment day. The night was dark 
and the mournful wind fU howling a sad requiem over our 
lost brother. To have attempted a search would have been 
folly. The frenzy of the hour was appalling, and we were 
helpless as new-born babes while one of our number was swallowed 
up by the great, mad river. For the time, of course, 
politics was lost sight of. It was sorrow and trembling, and 
when at early dawn our steamer reached the levee at Omaha 
our party looked as though a scourge of sickness had over 
taken all on board. 

t Several of the l'lattsinouth gentlemen secured the fleetest 
¦am available and hurried home with the sorrowful news, 
he body was found with little effort.

dishevelled hair, with keen black eyes, arose and addressed 
the chair with a voice tremulous with deep emotions, and 
offered a resolution, expressing in simple yet eloquent language 
the deep sorrow that burthened all our hearts. This 
was our introduction to Hon. T. M. Marquctt, and our 
admiration for the young man was born just then, and 
through the long years of our acquaintance it never grew 
less, but increased with the vears. </seg>

I Omaha was not the great city that it is to-day, and the ga thing 
of a full complement of delegates to two territorial 
nventions at the same date was a matter of sucli importce 
to the little city that other business was laid aside for 
e time, except such as pertained to the entertainment of 
e hundreds of strangers. 

All old timers well remember the antagonistic feeling; that 
existed between the sections of Nebraska known as North 
Plate and South Platte. The good people of the south side 
were quite sure that every man, woman, and child on the 
other side of the ugly river was a sworn enemy, and many 
were also quite positive that all North Platte folks had 
horns. We are not well posted in regard to just how bad 
the northern friends considered us folks, only we know that 
jealousy was most intense on both sides, and it cropped out 
on every possible occasion, and especially every political 
convention. Sometimes it would cause a small riot. One 
time this same foolish jealousy caused a split in the legislature, 
and part of it adjourned to Florence where there 
was opportunity to cool off. It seemed that our great statesmen 
of those days took supreme delight in pulling each other's 
hair. The South Platters greatly outnumbered their 
northern enemies, but what the north men lacked in numbers 
they made up in shrewdness and perfect organization, 
with just such a dare-devil spirit as knows no such word 
as fail. They were usually able to take pretty good care 
of their interests. The two principal towns of the territory 
were Omaha and Nebraska City, and these were the centers 
of the spirit of rivalry and jealousy. The hatred between 
Greece and old Troy could not be more intense, only that 
the savagery of the ancients was entirely lacking with the 
modern rivals. The watchword and battle-cry of each was

the game Marquett was thought to be the "dark horse." 

At an opportune moment, a delegate moved that candidates 
be requested to state their position on certain matters 
before the people, and also tell the convention what claims 
they had for preferment. Some one called lustily for Taylor. 
Taylor came forward and excused himself, and rather 
impertinently suggested that Mr. Daily should give an account 
of his stewardship. lie little dreamed what a gap he 
had opened for his rival. Mr. Daily did not wait for a 
second invitation, but fairly bounded to the front, and 
said, "Gentlemen of the convention, I am to-day proud of 
an opportunity to tell you of my stewardship," and he 
went right on telling what he had accomplished for the 
territory, and how he had downed Morton. It was a masterstroke, 
on a small scale like unto that Chicago speech with 
a "crown of thorns and a cross of gold." Mr. Taylor heard 
something drop just then, but the fight was on, and a most 
stubborn fight it was. Balloting, adjourning, buttonholing, 
and log-rolling. Three days we wrestled with the great problem 
before us. Many speeches were made; many appeals 
were made to the patriotism of the members. Most terrible 
would be the results of a rupture. Some of these efforts 
were eloquent, and especially so when reference was made 
to the dark clouds of war and the mighty struggle going on </seg>

Ksave us a home and a country. The stentorian voice of 
son just made the "wild woods ring" all around Omaha. 

There was an eccentric German, a learned doctor withal, 
Dr, J. F. Kenner, who would rise in dignity and sing out, 
"Mine cod, mine cod, ish the gentlemen going to sell U3 like 
the slaves!" Many episodes of the convention were truly 
sublime, particularly so when the great work the Republican 
party had in hand was so eloquently portrayed by some of 
the speakers. 

ffhe hearer will oear in mind that at this time the great 
tricidal war was raging "Fierce as ten furies, terrible 
hell." 

Kur democratic friends had but a short job. Judge Kinney 
nominated with but slight opposition. 

When foot-loose many of the leading democrats came ove 
to see the sights at our convention. Among the more notabl 
was the learned judge bearing triumphantly the banner o 
his victory, Dr. Geo. L. Miller, J. Sterling Morton, J. &gt; 
Woolworth, and A. J. Poppleton, and others whose names ar 
lost to us. Our democratic visitors were interested. \Y 
well remember Mr. Morton approaching the writer of tli 
paper at one stage of the game and made to him this terse 
remark, which \\h learned to appreciate later, "Daily has ¦'( 
you fellows where the wool is tight." We were race agai 
apprised that an onlooker could see just as far into a mil 
stone as the one wielding the mallet and chisel. The Ion 
struggle ended after about 13G ballots, with the nominatio 
of the distinguished Peruvian, amidst acclam tions of joy o 
the part of his friends and supporters, but it was a hard pil 
for many to swallow. Some were sour and Made all suits &lt; 
faces at the dish of crow served up for them, but the mm 
considerate swallowed it as if they were hankering afte 
crow. Taylor openly bolted the nomination, and .Mason fo 
lowed. Here we again had occasion to admire the manly torn 
age of Marquett. He said in words fairly burning, "(ientl

the choice of this convention is my choice, and from th 
hour I go into the field to do all I can for the nominee." A 
wild storm of applause greeted the young hero. Judge Kin 
ney was personally very popular. Taylor helped him all h 
possibly could. Mason lent his great ability and bull do 
courage to help him; but for all that, Sam Daily was tr 
umphantly elected. He made Nebraska a good and faithfu 
representative. 

There were many gentlemen at those two conventions that 
have had a very honorable part in laying broad and deep 
foundations for this great commonwealth, men who have 
made their marks in Nebraska history. 

Two territorial governors, Morton and Saunders, one tha 
became state governor, David Butler, and four who becam 
representatives, Daily, Hon. John Taffe, T. M. Marquett, an 
Hon. P. W. Hitchcock, three future U. S. senators, Alvi 
Saunders, P. YV. Hitchcock, and A. S. Paddock; one Federa 
judge, Elmer S. Dundy; one judge of Supreme Court of N 
braska, O. P. Mason ; and many distinguished business men 
We remember especially our friends Henry T. Clark and D 
J. P. IJenner. Although his name has several times appeara 
in this paper, it is well to record that one farmer, who bears 
the honors highest in the gift of our historical society, an&lt; 
who honored a seat in President Cleveland's cabinet, was 
member of the democratic convention and a visitor at ours 

If we remember correctly, Omaha had but two hotels a 
that time. The old Douglas house on Hainey St., and th 
Hei-ndnn, near the foot of Farnam. It was about half of \vh 
is now the U. P. headquarters. We understand it was bui 
by the distinguished citizen, Geo. Francis Train, and wa 
at that time and for several years the largest and best hote 
in the upper Missouri river valley. It was our good fortun 
to enjoy of its bounteous fare while in the city. 

Ear convention was held in the old Douglas county courtse 
( a little red brick), which stood on Farnam somere 
from 12th to 14th Sts. </seg>

JAs memory serves, it was mostly an open field between 
th and Capitol hill, where a rather shabby little state house 
cupied the ground that is now adorned by the beautiful 
jh school building. 

I To us Omaha looked to be rather dull, and we were not 
pressed with a foresight of the great future in store for it 
lere was scarcely any improvement in progress. Citizens 
ve as a reason for the dulness that the Platte river had 
sn out of its banks frequently during the season and was 
fordable, and nearly all the overland travel took the South 
atte routes, and left Omaha to hold an empty sack. The 
!y means of communication with the world at large, other 
in by telegraph, was by stage across Iowa, connecting with 
•s at Ottumwa, and by an occasional river steamer. We 
re no means of determining the number of Omaha's popuion, 
but we guess it had less than two thousand. In consting 
what is now before us at Omaha, at Nebraska City, 
Lincoln, and all along the way, it seems that we have been 
nsplanted to another world. It seems a dream. 

Our ret"rn Uome was by stage to Nebraska City and was 
without incident worthy of note, except we were forcibly 
reminded of the August frost, as all the corn was as dead as 
a smoked herring. 

KVe crossed the Platte at Oreapolis on a little rickety horeerer 
ferry boat. It looked to us as if we might have rolled 
our pants, waded, and saved the ferryman's fee, but we 
n't. 

We have made many visits to Omaha through the years 
but never again have we had the variety of experiences tha 
that trip afforded. We hardly think any later party conven 
tion has been its equal. How it would rejoice our heart to 
meet the living members or visitors of that memorable gath

JUDGE ELMER S. DUNDY. 

I The subject of this memorial sketch, short and imperfect 
it must necessarily be, was born on the fifth day of March, 
30, in the then wilds of Trumball county, Ohio. Trumball 
unty is a rough, broken, and almost mountainous section 
country, a fit birth-place for the rugged, virile, yet kindly 
ture of the man whose name heads this article. 

I His ancestry was of German descent on both sides, the 
otestant German that had first settled in eastern Pennsylnia 
and Maryland nearly two hundred years before. Here 
ring his boyhood years he followed the ordinary occupa&gt;ns 
of a farm lad, varied with much rambling, hunting, 
d fishing in his country neighborhood. This was his life 
to his eighteenth year, and it laid the foundations of a 
•ong physique that was a helpful factor in his race of life. 

This was the day of apprentices, and he was bound out to 
a local tanner with whom he remained until he fully mastered 
the trade, though he never engaged thereafter in tha 
occupation. He had no great liking for manual labor a 
this period of life. His inclinations were of a studious 
nature, and all kinds of books were sought and eagerly rea&lt; 

About the year 1850, the Dundy family, consisting o 
father, mother, and two brothers, moved to Clearfield county 
Pennsylvania, at that time a sparsely settled lumber regio 
on the upper waters of the Susquehanna river. Here he fo 
lowed such vocations as were incident to his life and con 
ditions, — farming, lumbering, and such odd jobs of manua 
labor as came to his hand. But he was, through all,

tightful, studious boy, earnestly bent upon improving his 
il and rising from the ranks. 

{Frugal and temperate in all things, with but few oppor 
lities to acquire academic learninsr, mastering such works 
elementary education as were in his reach, and a genera 
der of miscellaneous works, his receptive and capac'ous 
od easily enabled him to become, at the age of twenty-one 
f-educated and well informed. 

After a few terms of teaching in the rough lumbering an 1 
farming districts of the country, and then a residence in the 
town of Clearfield, Pa., he soon became principal of the city 
schools of this place. While engaged in teaching, he tool; 
up the study of law in the office of Hon. William A.Wallace, 
a leading democratic politician of that state, who afterwards 
became a national figure. Governor Bigler was also a resident 
of Clearfield at that time, and became a warm friend of 
the young Dundy. He afterwards was able to be of material 
service to Mr. Dundy, when he became an applicant for appointment 
at the hands of President Andrew Johnson to 
the office of United States District Judge of Nebraska. 
Judge Barrett, a leading lawyer and holder of judicial positions 
in the state of Pennsylvania, was also a resident of 
the little county seat town of Clearfield. Mr. Dundy's association 
with these men was intimate and based upon mutual 
regard, and must have greatly helped to fix in young Dundy's 
mind the high ideal he pursued ever after to the very .;ud 
of his earthly struggles. 

I In 1853, after a severe examination in open court, he was 
mitted to the Clearfield county bar and licensed to prac¦e 
law in the courts of the state. Soon afterwards he 
is elected justice of the peace, a position of trust he filled 
th firmness and ability. 

I In those days the star of empire was ever leading to the 
'stward and drawing with it in its train the young, vigous, 
and ambitious men of all ranks and conditions. There

ione, a soil of marvelous richness, abounding with streams 
and gushing springs, a land of beauty and natural wealth, 
and destined to become soon the home of millions. Nowhere 
else on earth could its equal be found, in beauty, extent, 
fertility, or climatic conditions. In addition to this, at this 
time a great moral struggle was raging between freedom and 
slavery, for the control and possession of the fairest portion 
of this beautiful land — that between the Indian Territory 
and the British possessions, then known as the Territory 
of Nebraska, a year later as the territories of Kansas and 
Nebraska. The eyes of the nation were all looking this way, 
and the struggle was begun which, a few years later, washed 
slavery out in a sea of blood. So in the year 1857 he left 
Clearfield and was irresistibly drawn into the seething caldron 
of conflicting ideas, passions, interests, and habits, and 
became a ready participant in this grand drama. His lot 
was cast upon the side of "free soil," and his efforts in that 
direction never ceased until the territorial legislature of his 
adopted home excluded slavery from Nebraska and the 
amendment to the national constitution wiped the "twin 
relic" from the escutcheon of the Kepublic. 

The territory of Nebraska had been purchased by treaties 
from the various Indian tribes occupying its area only three 
years previously, and Congress had organized the territorial 
government in May, 1854. In January, 1855, the first legislature 
met at Omaha and adopted almost bodily, and in a 
mass, the statutes of Iowa, as a code of laws for temporary

The courts, so far as the fees were concerned, were of bu 
little benefit to the young practitioner, but it was a main 
of his becoming acquainted with the rude but kindly pio 
neers, who were beginning to take up claims along the mar 
gins of the streams of the county — leaving all the best lam 
to be appropriated later, by more fortunate ones. 

I In the fall of 1857 a re-survey of the western line of th 
alf-Bieed Reserve put Archer off the government land am 
thin the limits of the reserve. This was an extinguishe 
the hopes of the Archer people, and at once a new town 
me two miles southwest, was laid out and named Fal 
ty. To this place the young lawyer at once moved, am 
came identified with its fortunes. Here he began the pra 
•e of law, and soon became a successful advocate, his grea 
liiiiinn sense and conscientious application gaining the con 
lence and respect of all. Ilis cotemporary and opposin 
wycr on almost every suit at law was the lion. Isha 
?avis, who was, in later years, an associate justice of th 
preine court of Arizona, and at all times and now a pr 
und and successful lawyer. 

I In the fall of 1858 Dundy was elected a member of the 
uncil (or senate) of the territorial legislature, and in 1860 
is re-elected. In those days the upper house was composed 
only thirteen members, but it has long been a tradition 
Nebraska that the council during those four years was as 
le a body of men and legislators as have ever come together 
any time in any state. During those four years the whole 
ound-work of the future state was laid out, and most of 
e legislation then enacted remains on the statute book toy. 
Judge Dundy was the author of many bills and the 
iding spirit of the upper house during all those four years. 

Emi 1838 to 1863 he was active and diligent in the pracf 
his profession, and it was during these years that the

seat of Richardson county was begun and ended. He was 
man of strong personal and local attachments ; he had now 
fully identified himself with the fortunes of his adopted town 
and the little city had a county seat fight on hand almos 
from the first day of its existence. He was no trimmer a 
any time or in any emergency, and his admiring fellow cit 
zens put upon his willing shoulders the burden of the con 
test. Before the people, at the polls, in the hails of the legis 
lature, he always led his partisans, and to his acuteness 
resources, perseverance, and indomitable courage, the futur 
of the town was assured. Without him there would hav 
been no Falls City, and the ground now covered with substantial 
brick and stone business houses and beautiful homes 
of contented and prosperous people would be till this hou 
a cornfield under the plough of the husbandman. 

In a material sense he profited but little, if any, from the 
upbuilding of the town, while many others have reaped rich 
rewards, directly and indirectly, from his labor. He cared 
but little to accumulate wealth, and counted life but ill-spent 
to waste it in piling up what men call riches, though his great 
and loyal nature freshened and bloomed with the reflection 
of divinity itself in the honest approbation of his fellow men. 

In the spring of 1863 he was appointed, by President Lincoln, 
an associate justice of the supreme court of the Territory 
of Nebraska. Under the organic law of the Territory, 
the justices of the supreme court were assigned to the three 
several judicial districts of the Territory, as presiding justices, 
with full original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal 
causes. His district was the southern one, and embraced 
his home county of Richardson, and extended from the Kansas 
line to the Platte river, and covered fully one-half of the 
organized counties of the Territory. He held court in each 
county twice a year, and then, during the winter months, the 
three justices sitting together, in bank, at Omaha, composed 
the supreme court, to sit in judgment upon such cases as </seg>

Itution for Nebraska, and the admission of the proposed

ction was close and exciting, but the constitution was 
opted, and Congress was asked to admit Nebraska as a

;islative ticket were also elected as necessary machinery 
• the new state. The first session of the new state legisure 
convened at Omaha on July 4, 1866, for the purpose 
electing two United States senators. Judge Dundy was

His career as Federal judge is well preserved in the mem 
ories of the people and the reports of the national courts. 
While sitting as a circuit judge in the Federal courts, wit 
a jurisdiction as broad as the national constitution, the nuts 
intricate questions of law and equity, together with crimina 
law, involving the life and liberty of individuals and coun 
less millions of money, were decided and disposed of by him 

He was now indeed the ideal judge, in the zenith of his 
fame, learning, and power, "of that learning which was the 
fruit of long and patient study, ripened and matured by the 
mellowing touch of age and experience." Though justice 
was his only trade, insensibly tempered by his kindly nature, 
his time, his talents, and his heart were his country's and hia 
country's alone. 

With a fixed salary and secure in office, during life or 
good behavior, the greed or passions of men had no more 
effect on him than the mists of morning upon the mountain 
peaks. While his court, in decorum and dignity, differed 
from the ordinary state courts of similar jurisdiction, as 
the church from the bar-room, he strained not the quality 
of mercy and tempered the quality of Federal statutes, which </seg>

would otherwise have borne heavily upon poor and deserving 
men. 

Perhaps the most celebrated cause that came before Judge 
Dundy for hearing and decision was what is generally known 
as the Ponca Indian habeas corpus case. From time immemorial 
the Ponca tribe of Indians had been inhabitants of 
and domiciled in the great northwest country, west of the 
Missouri river, and north of the Niobrara river. Ever since 
the acquisition of this territory from Napoleon, under th 
treaty of 1803, this tribe had been on friendly terms wit 
the pioneer settlers of the northwestern border and the Fe( 
eral government. For hundreds of years they had bee 
tustomed to a cold and temperate climate, following th 
it herds of buffalo in their annual hunts, yet at the sam 
e paying considerable attention to the pursuit of agr 
culture in a rude way. They had many corn fields, an 
were self-supporting. In the '50's, under treaties, they wer 
given a fair-sized reservation north of the Niobrara, am 
with schools, churches, missionaries, and teachers, were making 
good advances towards civilization, and had become very 
much attached to their homes. 

By some great blunder or oversight of the Interior Department, 
in a subsequent treaty with the Sioux tribes, their 
reservation was ceded away from the Poncas and given to 
the Sioux, without their knowledge or consent. Their protests 
were unheeded, and under orders from the general government, 
they were gathered together and bundled off to 
the Indian Territory, several hundred miles farther south, 
a wholesale and forcible deportation on almost an exact 
parallel with that of the Acadians in the eighteenth century. 

Their new home was hot and miasmatic, their spirits wer 
broken, their hearts sickened, and death soon began to rea 
an abundant harvest among them. Out of a membership o 
518 souls, 158 passed away in twelve months. Such a situa 
tion was past even Indian human endurance — nearly all th 
survivors were sick and disabled. At this juncture the prin </seg>

cipal chief of the Poncas, Standing Bear, taking the remnant 
of his own family, his dead children, and some twentyfive 
or thirty of his followers, made the resolve to sever all 
connection with his tribe, and strike out to the north again, 
somewhere near their old home. They eventually reached 
their old neighbors and kinsmen, the Omaha tribe, and went 
to work as farmers and laborers on the Omaha reservation. 

Iigain the strong hand of the general government inter 
ed, and General Crook, commanding the Department o 
¦ Platte, was ordered to arrest all the fugitives and return 
¦m once more to the Indian Territory. The arrest wa 
de, the Indians were in custody of the military power, when 
K-eedings were commenced in the U. S. Circuit Court o 
braska, before Judge Dundy, asking for their release upo 
beas corpus. The liest legal talent of the state was enliste&lt; 
behalf of the homeless, hunted, and heart-broken wander 
i. A new question had arisen, a new principle must be enun 
ted, a precedent must be established. Here were Indians 
vv without a tribe or tribal connection. The habeas corpu 
*s of the Federal government gave any "person" the righ 
sue for its privileges. 

fThe great questions to be passed upon and decided were 
lether an Indian was a "person"' and whether he had the 
;ht of expatriation? Could he sever his connection with 
i band or tribe? And had he the inalienable right to life, 
&gt;erty, and pursuit of happiness under the national consti- 

But few judges have been called upon to pass upon questions 
of greater magnitude. All the power and influence 
of the national government on one side, while it was doubtful 
whether even a "person" was on the other. But the great 
learning and the great sympathies of this broad-minded and 
just man were turned and focused upon this momentous 
cause, and in a lengthy opinion, showing deep research, 
thorough investigation, a luminous knowledge of constitutional 
law, and a tender respect for the rights of the lowly, </seg>

E Indian was clearly shown to be a "person" and a human 
ng. As has been aptly said, he formulated the Magna 
arta of the Indian race. 

Il'lie law officers of the Government were strongly incline&lt; 
rards appealing the case to the Supreme Court, but event 
ly concluded not to do so. The decision stands to-da 
the law of the land, an everlasting and ever-flowing foun 
a of justice and mercy. Of this decision, Judge Lambert 
i has most truly said: "It gave them (the Indian races 
tanding in the government, in the courts, and before th 
r, which will ultimately admit them to the enjoyment o 
rights and privileges guaranteed to our most favored 
zens." 

Emongst the scores of other celebrated and important

violation of General Sheridan's orders, in invading the

wages cases. 

[Barij in 1801, Judge Dundy and Miss Mary H. Robertson 
-e united in matrimony, at Omaha, soon afterwards maktheir 
home at Falls City, Neb. His wife was a true 
pineet in every sence of the word, and their home was 
ractive and refined; and altogether they were blessed

few of the temporary sojourners of earth. Four children

With strong local attachments, both for vicinage and for 
friends midst which he had lived so long, it was with a saddened 
heart that he changed his residence to the principal 
city of the state in 1884.

In person, Judge Dundy was of athletic and rugged form, 
I of strong constitution, probably from heredity and labor 
ing youth. He was not a bookworm or student recluse, 
p delving amid the musty and forgotten lore of the dead 
t; rather a lover of sunshine and the free air of windpt 
plains, hunting with horse and gun through woods 
by rivers; a lover of horses and a capital judge thereof; 
1 lower of the chase, after the large game of the Rockies — 
1 year engaging in an extended hunt, with a party organl 
by him for that purpose. 

All men have their predominant characteristics. Some are 
one-sided and easily gaged. Judge Dundy was not constituted 
that way. He had as many sides as a diamond has faces. 
Cool headed, wary, astute, and determined amid the contentions 
of men, he was an ideal counselor of partisans, where 
the conflicting interests of closely balanced parties were desperately 
struggling in the arenas of the legislative forum 
or upon the floors of political conventions which made or 
marred the fortunes of factions. With unbounded opportunities 
to acquire great wealth, he was more than satisfied 
with a moderate competence. Placed in a position in life 
where he had no call to ask help of any, yet he was always 
hearing the call of others. He was not troubled with deafness 
in that respect, — always helpful, tender, and sympathetic, 
from the depths of a nature overflowing with kindness 
and love of friends. With him it was "once a Mead, always

THE NEBRASKA CONSTITUTION. 

SOME OF ITS ORIGINAL AXU PECULIAR FEATURES. 

By Charles Snmntr Lobingier of the Omaha Bar. Read before the State His- 

Mr. President, and Fellow Members of the State Historical 

Society : 

I It might seem, at iirst thought, that a young commonwealth 
;e Nebraska would have no original or peculiar features in 
i fundamental law. Constitution-making had been in 
M, even in America, for almost a century before the 
st convention assembled for that purpose within the prrs 
t boundaries of Nebraska. .Moreover, the i&gt;olitical ideas 
lich form the subject-matter of most constitutions had been 
•ought out through a long period of European civic develop¦ut 
before the New World history had even begun. One 
ight expect to find, therefore, that the Nebraska constitu•u 
is but a copy of similar instruments which preceded it. 
reality, however, the fundamental law of this state conins 
a number of important provisions which appear to be 
iginal, and which afford an interesting field for investiga&gt;u, 
not alone for the jurist and the student of our legal sysm, 
but also for the local historian. 

PECULIAR FEATURES IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS. 

IThe Bill of Kights is the oldest part of existing constitu)ns. 
Many of its clauses are exact reproductions of the 
strument of the same name which marked the successful 

torical Society, January 10, 1899. </seg>

issue of the English revolution. Still other provisions find 
their origin as far back as Magna Charta. In this part of our 
constitution we might least expect to find originality. And 
yet our Bill of Kights provides its own rule of construction 
by means of a clause which makes our constitution different 
from those of most other states. 

I It is commonly said that the canons of construction for 
¦deral and state constitutions are directly opposite, that 
b Federal instrument is a grant and confers no powers 
t expressly mentioned, while a state constitution is a limition 
and passes all power not expressly retained. 1 To 
is doctrine, so well established elsewhere, our Bill of Rights 
r ords an exception. For the last clause of this part of our 
ndamental law is as follows : "This enumeration of rights 
all not be construed to impair or deny others, retained by 
i people, and all power not herein delegated remains icith 

HISTOttY OF THK CLAUSE. 

While this clause is not original in our present constiti 
tion. it is peculiar to a few states. ;md its history deserve 
brief attention. It seems to lime appeared for the first tiin 
in the original Ohio constitution of 1802, but in somewhat dif 
Herat phraseology. 3 It was inserted in the constitution o 
1&gt;."»1 of the same state, 4 in language identical with that b 
which it is now expressed in our own. In 1S55 5 and agai 
in 1858* the clause appeared in the Kansas constitutions o 
those years, and in 1866 it was made a part of the first con 
stitution of this state, 7 whence it was carried forward to th 
present instrument of 1875. Meanwhile, in 1868 the state 
of North 8 and South Carolina 9 each adopted a constitutio 
which contained the mm provision as a part of its bill o

II significance appears generally to have been overlooks 
erally applied, it would require the same rule of stric 
istruction for both our federal and state constitutions; i 
uld give the legislature, as well as the other branches o 
i state government no implied powers, while every Iegish 
e act would need support in some express clause of th 
istitution. I have not observed, however, that any sue 
e has been followed in practice. The construction give 
our fundamental law by the courts appears not to diffe 
m that awarded to state constitutions generally, 12 and 
re known of arguments at the bar wherein it was eithe 
iumed or asserted that our constitution is a limitation an&lt; 
: a grant. Still it seems unlikely that so plain a provisio 
II always escape notice, and it may yet work surprisin 
inges in constitutional interpretation. 

UIGI1T OF APPEAL GUARANTEED. 

Another peculiar provision of our Bill of Rights is that 
which guarantees the right of appeal. It is as follows : "The 
right to be heard in all civil cases in the court of last resort, 
by appeal or otherwise, shall not be denied." 13 The guaranty 
of the right to be heard in courts of original jurisdiction 
is found in almost, if not quite, every American constitution, 
aud is as old as Magna Charta. But the right to be 
heard in an appellate court is a different matter, and I find no 
constitution except ours which guarantees it. This provision, 
like the one last noticed, would be exceedingly important 
were it literally applied, for its logical effect is to invalidate 
all legislation which prevents a hearing in the 
court of last resort. It might even be true that a literal construction 
of this clause would invalidate certain statutes 
which cut off an appeal where a litigant fails to take certain 
formal steps within a prescribed period. But this clause, 
like the others, is not literally applied. We have. c. g., a 
statute" which entirely forbids an appeal from an inferior </seg>

(rt in cases tried to a jury where the amount claimed does 
exceed twenty dollars, and this statute has been several 
es upheld by the courts. 15 In practice, therefore, this conutional 
provision seems not to have materially affected 
legislation of this state. It has, however, influenced the 
rse of judicial legislation, at least one decision having 
a overruled on the strength of the constitutional guar- 

POPULAR VOTE FOR UNITED STATES SENATOR. 

A provision submitted separately from the constitution itself, 
but nevertheless forming a part of that instrument, is 
that which authorizes the legislature to enable the voters to 
express their choice of candidates for the office of United 
States Senator. At the time of its adoption it was a unique 
plan and was welcomed as a step towards the popular election 
of senators, but in practice it has amounted to little. Twice in 
our political history a popular candidate has received a large 
vote for the senatorial office — once in 1886, when the late 
General Van Wyck sought re-election, and again in 1894, 
when Messrs. Bryan and Thurston were rival candidates. 
But at no time has the legislature actually provided for a 
popular ballot upon senatorial candidates, and as the constitutional 
clause is permissive only and not mandatory or 
self-executing, the votes which are cast for this purpose are 
not officially canvassed, and are treated as a mere voluntary 
expression of the electors. Moreover, in no instance has a 
senatorial contest in this state been determined or even materially 
affected by the popular vote cast for a particular 
candidate. Nevertheless, this provision has been incorporated 
into the new constitution of South Carolina, and was 
probably borrowed from ours, as no other instrument of the 
kind embodied such a plan. Under more favorable conditions, 
too, it may yet prove to be the transitional step towards 
the direct popular choice of United States senators. </seg>

FEW OFFICES AND SMALL SALARIES. 

Law has been characterized by an eminent Italian juris 
as the product of economic conditions. 17 Our state const i 
tution, as the highest expression of local law, illustrates thi 
in several features. Indeed, it may not be inaptly termed 
a "grasshopper" constitution, for in 1S7~&gt;, when it wa 
framed, the State was just emerging from the gloom am 
destitution caused by the insect scourge of the preceding 
summer. The scrupulous care with which otliees were lini 
ited and salaries curtailed shows the influences of these con 
ditions on the work of the convention. The highest salary 
allowed by the constitution is $2,500, and yet, even that sun 
must have seemed a fortune to the impoverished Nebraskan 
of a quarter of a century ago. 18 The story of how these check 
and limitations regarding offices have been evaded throug] 
such means as the creation of boards and the appointmen 
of secretaries is a familiar one and illustrates the inefflcacy 
as well as inexpediency of permanent measures to mee 
merely temporary conditions. 

Our fundamental law was framed at a transitional perio&lt; 
in the history of constitution-making in America. The con 
stitutions which preceded it were of the old type, containin 
merely the Bill of Rights, the framework of government 
and a few other necessary provisions. Those framed in recent 
years are of increasingly widening scope extending fa 
into the lield of general legislation. 19 The Nebraska con 
stitution occupies a position midway between these two types 
It has a less extensive scope than those framed during th 
last decade, but it covers many subjects which would hav 
seemed out of place in the constitutions of the early part o 
the century. Such are the articles (XI, XII, XIII) relatin 
to railroad and other corporations, portions of which hav 
been of frequent consideration by the supreme court in recen </seg>

THE NEBRASKA CONSTITUTION 

UNCHANGEABILITY OF THE CONSTITUTION. 

Perhaps the most effective and at the same time most 
serious of these peculiar features of our constitution is its 
unchnngeableness. For its own amendment, it requires "a 
majority of the electors voting at the election," 20 and this 
has been construed by the supreme court to mean a majority 
of the highest aggregate number of votes cast for any 
candidate or proposition, 21 and not merely a majority of 
those cast on the amendment. One of the judges in the opinion 
wherein this construction is announced frankly recognizes 
that "taking the past as a criterion by which to foretell 
the future, it would seem that, under the construction 
adopted, it would be almost, if not quite, impossible to change 
the present constitution, however meritorious may be the 
amendment proposed." And this conviction is not confined 
to the judicial but is also shared by the executive branch. 
Governor Poynter, in his inaugural message, calls attention 
to the fact that, although proposed amendments are snbmitted 
at almost every session of the legislature, yet, "in 
the press of other matters and in the excitement of political 
campaigns, they are lost sight of and fail to receive popular 
ratification." The justification of this remark will appear 
when we recall that, while our constitution has been in force 
for almost a quarter of a century, and while at one time 
(in 1896) as many as twelve propositions of amendment 
were pending, there is but one instance where a change has 
been actually effected — and that only through a legislative 
recount after the proposition had been declared lost by the 
official canvassers. 22 

DISADVANTAGES OP THE UNCHANGEABLE FEATUBB. 

E seems to be conceded then, that our constitution is pracly 
unchangeable by amendment, and, if so, we find here 
only a most peculiar feature, but one of gravest conto 
the commonwealth. Doubtless it is important that </seg>

            <seg id="p103">

NEBRASKA STATE HISTOUKAl. SOCIETY 

Ir fundamental law should be stable and secure, not changed 
th every wave of popular caprice, and not easily manipued 
by designing politicians. 23 But, on the other hand, it 
not an edifying spectacle to behold a great commonwealth 
tere needed legal reforms are rendered impossible because 
i hands of the state were fettered in its infancy. 

NEED OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. 

A remedy for this plight into which our laws hare fallen 
seems to lie in the calling of a constitutional convention, and 
a general belief that this is the only possible solution is indicated 
by the fact that both our incoming and retiring governors 
have recommended that plan to the present legislature. It 
is gratifying to know that such a course meets the approval of 
some of the most careful students of political h.icnce. Mr.E.L. 
Godkin, editor of the Nation, always conservative and never 
an optimist, thus characterizes the constitutional convention 
as a factor in American political development: 24 "Through 
the hundred years of national existence it has received little 
but favorable criticism from any quarter. It is still an honor 
to have a seat in it. The best men in the community are still 
eager or willing to serve in it, no matter at what cost to 
wealth or private affairs. I can not recall one convention 
which has incurred either odium or contempt. Time and 
social changes have often frustrated its expectations or have 
shown its provisions for the public welfare to be inadequate 
or mistaken, but it is very rare indeed to hear its wisdom and 
integrity questioned. In looking over the list of those who 
have figured in conventions of the state of New York since 
the Revolution, one finds the name of nearly every man of 
weight and prominence; and few lay it down without thinking 
how happy we should be if we could secure such service 
for our ordinary legislative bodies." 

Who shall say that the creation of such a body at this time 
would not summon to the service of the state many gifted </seg>

so, the result would tend to quicken and regenerate the not 
too wholesome civic life of our beloved commonwealth, besides

HISTORY OF THE INCARCERATION OF THE LIN- 

By Hon. A. J. Sawyer. Read before the Nebraska State Historical Society m» 

its session evening, January , 189- 

E'he tiist flection under the new city charter creating cities 
the first class, taring a population of less than sixty 
usand ami more than twenty-tive thousand inhabitants. 
I which was approved .March li."&gt;. 1887, occurred on the first 
¦sday of April of that year. 

Rincoln had within the last few years rapidly increased in 
illation, wealth, and territory. 

I 'he time had arrived when Lincoln was rapidly becomin 
¦ of the principal cities of the West, hut she was withou 
ed streets, sanitary or surface leverage, and without a 
quatc supply of water. She was about to enter upon a 
of public improvements commensurate with her gTOWt 
I population. The good name which the city had formerl 
sessed for law and order had materially suffered withi 
last year or two, and license and misrule were in th 
iiidant to such an extent that the leading citizens organ 
1 a Law and Order League for the purpose of aiding th 
horities in restoring good government and a decent rect 
for the ordinances already enacted. Law and orde 
[ municipal reform became the watchwords of the goo 
zens of Lincoln, while the others were in favor of the the 
iblished order of things. 

Among the elective otliceis to be chosen under the new 
charter were the mayor and six councilmen. 

fhese considerations all contributed to make the election 
of the most spirited ever witnessed in Lincoln. 

There were three candidates for the mayoralty: Edward 
1'. Roggf, ex-Secretary of State, by the regular Hepublican 
convention; Andrew J. Cropsey, by the prohibitionists, and 
Andrew J. Sawyer by the citizens' reform inovemeut, which

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

Ehe result was the election of the citizens' candidate by 
ajority of 537. 

Ehe city council after the election consisted of Lorenzo 
Billingsley, Lewis C. Pace, Granville Ensign, William J. 
per, Joseph Z. Briseoe, James Dailey, John Fraas, Rob- 
B. Graham, Henry II. Dean, Fred A. Hovey, John M. 
ks, and Nelson C. Brock. 

The newly elected officers were in due time inducted ini 
office, took the prescribed oaths, pledged themselves to du] 
and faithfully administer the affairs of the city, see tha 
the laws thereof were carefully executed, and settled dow 
to the performance of their duties as best they knew. Hav 
ing adjusted themselves to the conditions imposed by th 
new charter, they selected an entirely new police force, unde 
civil service rules and regulations, and instructed them 1 
see that all of the existing ordinances were strictly and rig 
idly enforced. They then turned their attention to the wor 
of public improvements, the paving of the streets, constru 
tion of sewers, water works, and the like, and the genera 
routine of municipal affairs; and so spring passed into sun 
mer and summer into fall with little occurring to distur 
the serenity of the council to jar the machinery of the ne 
city government; but the sear and yellow leaf brought sor 
trials and tribulations to the reform administration. 

Eio far as we can judge, the new administration would have 
. comparatively easy sailing had it not been for the police 
ge. He had been elected the spring before for a term of 
&gt; years, and consequently was a hold-over official with yet 
ear to serve. 

There had been rumors afloat for some time that "even 
handed justice" was not always dispensed from his bench; 
that the eyes of the presiding goddess were not infrequently 
unveiled, and that the scales of justice were scarcely, if ever, 
accurately adjusted, and that the ermine had even been 
known to cover the wool-sack at places remote from where 
the seat of the city court had been permanently established. </seg>

I Whenever the fountains of justice are corrupted, whether 
inferior, limited, general, or superior jurisdictions, the 
uple within those jurisdictions experience a most unfortute 
condition of things, and one of the most intolerable 
d crying evils of our times is the inefficient and often absoely 
corrupt and dissolute personages selected to adminer 
justice in the lower courts and particularly in the police 
irta of our larger cities. 

I The citizens can not be too circumspect in the selection of 
t'se (illicials, for no permanent and effectual municipal rernis 
can be had until these primary courts are thorgfcly 
purged from the corrupt ward strikers and political 
elers who, luring secured these places for party services 
"ways that are dark and tricks that are vain," in the 
me of justice perpetrate injustice, fraud, and oppression. 

What had lieen rumor at length took definite form. Three 
citizens and tax payer*, who had cognizance of the delinquencies 
of the judge, filed with the city clerk a petition or 
complaint in which they set forth that the police judge of 
the city of Lincoln had collected large sums of money, in 
his capacity of police judge, as fines from certain parties 
who were conducting certain outlawed occupations, and 
that he had failed to make any report of the same on his 
dockets or to account to the city therefor. That he had also 
collected fines for the violation of the statutes of Nebraska 
to the amount of $329, as shown by his dockets, which amount 
he had neglected and refused to turn over to the county 
treasurer as required by law, and, assuring the council that 
they had ample evidence to substantiate the charges, requested 
that a thorough investigation be made. Under the 
city ordinance it became the duty of the city council, when 
charges were preferred against any of the elective officers 
of the city, to institute an inquiry, and, if the party accused 
should be found guilty, to declare his office vacant. Accordingly 
a committee, consisting of Councilmen Billingsley,

A time and place were fixed for the taking of testimony, and 
•lue notice was served upon the defendant. The defendant 
riled his answer, in which he first made a general denial and 
i lien admitted that he had failed to turn over to the county 
i ivasurer certain funds he had collected, but claimed that his 
failure was due to his ignorance or misunderstanding of the 
law. At the time appointed for the taking of testimony defendant 
appeared with his counsel, Messrs. L. C. Burr, O. 
P. .Mason, and C. E. Magoon, the complainants with their 
counsel, D. G. Courtnay, J. B. Strode, and J. E. Philpot. 
The taking of testimony occupied some five or six weeks. 
When the committee came to make their report to the council 
they stated that in their opinion they had no authority, 
as a committee, to make findings of fact, or in any sense to 
try said police judge upon the charges. That as the ordinance 
stood he should lie tried by the council sitting as a body and 
not by a committee. The council in the meantime had discovered 
the defect in the ordinance and amended the same 
so as to authorize a committee to act in lieu of the whole 
number. The same committee was then reappointed to proceed 
under the amended ordinance to take testimony and 
make their report. As much time had already been consumed, 
it was stipulated that the testimony already taken 
might be used with the right of either party to offer such 
additional evidence as he might desire. When the testimony 
was all in, the second committee, after a most stormy siege 
and constant bombardments of lawyers on either side, made

e committee accordingly recommended that the city conn 
declare the office of police judge of the city of Lincol 
•ant, and the mayor be requested to fill the office wit 
ie suitable person by appointment. 

The committee made their report to the council on the 12th 
of September. Complainants and respondent were present 
with their attorneys. Both the respondent and his attorneys 
importuned the council in speeches both eloquent and lengthy 
not to rely upon the report of the committee but to listen as 
a body to the reading of the testimony and the further argument 
of the case. They declared that the committee was 
without authority to hear the evidence and that both the committee 
and city council were without jurisdistion to try the 
respondent on the charges preferred, because, as they said, 
the ordinance of August 15, 1887, was an ex post facto law ; 
yet if the whole council would listen to the evidence and argument 
of the attorneys they would be satisfied with the decision 
reached. The council concluded to accede to the wish 
of the accused and, at his request, the case was adjourned to 
a day certain, when the council, as a body, was to sit in judgment 
in the case. This arrangement seemed to be perfectly 
satisfactory to the accused. The real purpose, however, in 
securing the adjournment was not that the council might 
be afforded an opportunity to further hear the case, but rather 
that they might be relieved from having anything further to 
do with the proceedings; for, in the meantime, attorney for 
resjiondent went to St. Louis and exhibited to the Hon. David 
J. Brewer, then circuit judge of this circuit, a bill in equity in 
which he claimed that his client was being tried by the city

I the American people ever since the landing of the Pilgrim 
ithers, and which in fact constituted the very corner stone 
the Republic, was, after all, a myth, a delusion, and a snare; 
at a city, county, or state was powerless to purge itself, 
the manner pointed out by law, of the corrupt and reekis 
officials that might fasten themselves upon the bodies 

I On the night in question the council chamber was thronged 
th citizens anxiously awaiting the action of the council. 

IThe condition and the theory stood like grim specters in 
e presence of the city fathers, unwelcome, as they were 
rbidding, to the presence of all assembled. 

I To adopt the theory and await the final decision of the 
"deral court as to whether they might be permitted to do a 
tie house-cleaning on their own account in their own bailick, 
would necessitate the continuance of the condition, 
id very likely defendant would complete his term of office 
lg before a final decision could be reached, and the end 
ught to be accomplished by the investigation completely 

E'n the other hand, not to accept the theory was to go 
nter to the mandate of the court and incur the risk of 
and possibly imprisonment for contempt of court. 

While the mayor and council had the greatest respect for 
the learning and ability of the eminent jurist (since one of 
the justices of the supreme court) they could not but feel 
that the injunction bad been allowed under false misrepresentations, 
and that, when the true state of affairs was made 
known to him, he would not be disposed to look with such 
contemptuous disfavor upon their acts as upon those who 
procured the writ to issue. Besides, after a careful investigation, 
they became satisfied that a Federal court of equity 
was without any jurisdiction to restrain the action of the 
council in performance of an act enjoined upon them by the 
law of the State. Therefore, after a careful, candid, and 
earnest consideration of the subject, it was unanimouly de- </seg>

raining order of the court. 

Ehe council, on the 29th of September, 1887, confirmed the 
ings of the committee, declared the office of police judge

E'pon the receipt of the notice the judge declared his inion 
to continue to hold possession and dispense justice ( ?)

The following proceedings were then had and done 

"Lincoln, Neb., September 30, 1887. 
''Marshal P. II. Cooper:

ilified and given his bond, and has been duly commissioned 
ice judge to fill the vacancy occasioned by the action of 
city council last evening, and you will please see that he 
luly installed in his office. 

"A. J. Sawyer, 

The order was promptly carried out. The police judge was 
bodily removed, and thenceforth it was Judge EL J. Whitmore, 
police judge of the city of Lincoln. It is needless to 
that justice was enthroned, the office honored, and the 
ermine kept unspotted so long as Judge Whitmore presided. 

We had crossed the Itubicon, and were waiting for developments. 
The ex-police judge, no longer permitted to mete 
out justice, and deprived of the emoluments of office, was in 
anything but an amiable frame of mind, and his attorneys, 
thwarted in their plans, were most belligerent. 

E&gt;ire vengeance was threatened upon every one who had 
ticipated in the investigation or who had aided and

e not tardy in maturing.

"Notwithstanding all this the said mayor and all of said

order of this honorable court in the matter of this injunction.

erty on promise that they would report in court on the day 
named. 

' The journal in the city clerk's office of November 21, 1887, 
records the regular meeting of the council in the evening of 
that date, the transaction of a large amount of business, and 
resolution that "when the council adjourned it was to meet 
at the B. &amp; M. depot next morning at eight o'clock a.m. 

ilt was about the hour of sunset on Monday, the day before 
e time appointed for the hearing, when "Pap'' Hastings, 
e deputy marshal, hurled himself into the presence of the 
otemptuous councilmen, with those ominous writs which 
parceled out to each defendant by name. 

Iifter a careful inspection of the documents, Councilman 
llingsley, who, with great fortitude, had moved that the 
ce of police judge be declared vacant, was observed to 
se his optics from the parchment and gaze with a faraway 
k to where the sun was descending behind the western 
1 tops, but Councilman Dean, whose optimistic nature 
uld not permit him to contemplate any ill omens, and 
ose unclouded nature was ever as serene as a summer's 
r, essayed to dispel the gloom that was settling down upon 
! disturbed defendants by imitating the action of Kichnd 
when he summoned his trusty generals about him on 
i eve before the meeting with Richard on the field of Bos- 

Addressing the disconsolate around him, and pointing 
toward the departing orb, he said, 

"Look ye, the weary sun hath made a golden set, 

And by the bright light of his fiery car 
Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow." 

He paused; for the moment solemn stillness reigned. For 
the time bleak melancholy seemed to mark each pensivcprisoner 
for her own. Meanwhile Dean's eyes swept the heavens 
as with telescopic vision. Again he broke the silence, "See

¦avens as an open book. I have learned to cast the horo

I Just at this moment, when he was beginning to wax eloent 
over objects too remote for the contemplation or comchcnsion 
of ordinary mortals, he was interrupted by Counlinan 
Fraas, who, thinking it unbecoming one culprit to 
cupy so much precious time, gave vent to his Teutonic feel 
p in the laconic words which have since become historic: 
macht mir nnide." 

J. II. Rurks said that it was "the winter of his discontent." 
Pace was heard to mutter that "The paths of glory lead but 
to the grave," while all the rest joined in the chorus, 

"Our honor and our freedom's at the stake 

Which to defend we must away and answer to the summons 

of the court.' 

1 Scarcely had the refrain died away when the demoniac 
ice of the ex-judge, who had been a silent, unobserved spector, 
rang out. 

"And my fame on brighter pages 
Penned by poets and by sages 
Shall go thundering down the ages." 

The morrow came; but not the good one predicted by Dean. 
The sky was o'ercast with clouds. The earth was covered 
with a mantle of white. The snow was still falling, and the 
wind was chill and piercing. 

IAt eight o'clock the city fathers answered roll call at the

ended. Many of Lincoln's prominent citizens were on

prisoners could be heard, "like mulllcd drums Inciting

At length the silence was broken by Judge Brewer, who 
inquired if the attorneys were ready to proceed in (be matter

ingsley might bo permitted to show cause why the defendants 
should not be punished for contempt. Mr. Billingsley 
had prepared aa elaborate review of the investigation from 
bfgtainlag to end, which, to the minds of the councilmen, presented 
excellent reasons why they should not be punished for 
their action. He assured the court that not one ill word or 
harsh term had escaped the lips of any of the councilmen at 
the time they took the action that had called forth the writ 
of attachment, but, on the contrary, they had expressed the 
deepest regret that a judge of so high character, unquestioned 
integrity, and great legal attainments should feel it his duty 
to bar their action in an investigation which to them seemed 
necessary to secure better municipal government; that the 
mayor and city council had endeavored to act with decorum 
and propriety becoming their official position; that they re 
lied upon justice at the hands of the court by presenting the 
justness of their cause. He called the attention of the court 
to the accession of the city council to the request of the expolice 
judge and his attorney — that the case might be heard 
by the council as a body, and the postponement of the hearing 
for their accommodation; now he had taken advantage of 
the postponement to thwart their action ; -now his attorney 
had, by misrepresentations in the bill, imposed upon the 
court; and that without such misrepresentations he felt 
sure that the court would not have allowed the injunction; 
that, while there was a bare possibility that the court might 
look upon their action in declaring vacant the office of police 
judge with disfavor, on the other hand a sense of shame, disgrace, 
and humiliation would follow from a failure to carry 
out what they considered to be their sworn duty in the premises, 
a disregard of which would bring upon them the criticism, 
gibes, and contempt of all good citizens, and would 
continue in office as police judge for two or three months, or 
probably until the end of his term of office, one whom they 
deemed utterly unfit for the position and who had brought 
disgrace and shame not only upon the office he held, but upon </seg>

the city of Lincoln; that the council had endeavored to in 
form themselves upon the legal aspect of the case and were 
thoroughly satisfied that the court was without jurisdictio 
to entertain the case, and that the ex -police judge, if he ha 
any Cause of action, had adequate remedy at law. That th 
bill of complaint did not show a sum amounting to $2,00 
in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs; that these 
reasons were offered to show the court that the violation o 
the order was not done insolently or recklessly or withou 
respect to the honor and dignity of the court, and praye&lt; 
that their Honors might consider these reasons in mitigatio 
of the offending. 

At the close of Mr. Billingsley's statement Mr. Lambertso 
asked permission to introduce some oral testimony, whic 
was granted. The mayor was then sworn and examined b 
Mr. Lambertson as to the character and standing of severa 
members of the city council. Allegations contained in th 
bill upon which the injunction was secured reflected seriousl 
upon the character and standing of the councilmen, am 
would naturally lead the judge who granted the order to thin 
that the Lincoln city council was made up of gamblers, o 
those in sympathy with the gambling fraternity, and the pur 
pose of the examination was to disabuse the mind of the court 
of any preconceived erroneous impressions he might hav 
formed. The testimony developed that all of the councilme 
were gentlemen engaged in lawful occupations. That the 
were men of excellent business standing, honest, honorable 
and of high character, and that they had no sympathy or af 
filiation with the lawless elements of the city. 

The ex-judge was then called to the stand by his attorney, 
Mr. Burr, and detailed minutely the circumstances and transactions 
of the council at the meeting immediately preceding 
that at which the final vote was taken and the one at which 
the question of adopting the report of the committee without 
reading the testimony was discussed and voted upon. 

These were the only two witnesses examined. The exam- </seg>

ination took up the forenoon. Court convened in the afternoon 
and listened to the argument of counsel. Judge Hrewer 
then stated th;'t lie would decide the matter in question it 
ten o'clock a.m. the next day, and the council filed out, as one 
of the newspapers stated, "with considerable time left in 
which to contemplate the uncertainties of this life and vicissitudes 
of aldermanic existence." 

I'ronipth at ten o'clock the next morning the judges wer 
the beach and the prisoners in the hex. It is needle— t 
iark that they were also on the tiptoe of expectation. Dur 
the adjournment they had canvassed the probabilities o 
ivorahle or unfavorable decision of the court and had hean 
subject very generally discussed. Most of the members c 
bar and public sentiment generally believed that the dec 
l would be favorable, and the buoyant expression of hoj 
med from the countenance of the members as they sa 
liting judgment. Councilman Ensign was so sure of 
orable outcome that he was heard to whisper to the men 
s of the council that they needn't be worried; that h 
lid pay all fines that might be asse.-sed against them. 

Judge Brewer then began to deliver his opinion, the courtroom 
being again thronged with spectators. The judge reviewed 
the case at length and proceeded in an elaborate opinion 
to show that the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter, 
and that, while the bill was defective in not stating any 
amount in controversy, yet that was a matter which could be 
amended. A court of equity had the right to enjoin the 
proceedings &lt;jf a state tribunal in a case of the nature pie 
sented by the bill. After sweeping away the various objec- 

• 

tions urged by attorneys for the council as to jurisdiction, he 
then came to the reasons urged in mitigation of the olTense 
and said that another matter should be taken into consideration: 
that is, what circumstances of expiation, wrong, or 
trickery, fancied or real, provoked the action which was done. 

Kit is," said he, "human nature to resent an act, a wrong 
implished by a trick, and we must always recognize that </seg>

as | part of our common human nature. If parties, mistaken 
or otherwise, fancy they have been tricked into a position 
where their proceeding! are likely to he battled, it is not to be 
wondered at that tkej feel keenly, and the court can not blind 
its eves to such a matter as that." 

I Then he reviewed what the defendants had said in regard 
the postponement of the hearing of the investigation and

practised upon him by the council.

anticipation that he was about to say "fine"] imprisonment." 
A bolt from a clear sky could not have produced a gNBtef 
smprsc than when the judge said "imprisonment." They 
were cooattng on complete exoneration. "On the other 
hand," said he. "they are gentlemen of character and position. 
They represent the second city in the State, as I am advised, 
in wealth, in population, and in business. [Here a 
gleam of Iiojm' seemed to animate the tired council.] They 
are the council of the capital city of the State. If the court 
should say that men occupying so high a position can disregard 
the process of the courts [here all hope departed] what 
may we expect from men having no such backing of position, 
respectability, and influence? Can we ask the poor, friendless 
man to obey the process of the court if men occupying

by the very fact of the respectability of the gentlemen. 
of the position that they hold, to Impose such a fine as shall 
be a lesson, not merely a punishment to them, but a lesson to 
all? [At this point the stalwart councilmen showed signs of 
great depression.] I have tried to look at this case in all its 
phases, and, while I am very glad that I was able to come 
to the conclusion that no imprisonment was proper, and it 
will be unnecessary and therefore an improper exercise of

hand, felt that I could not pass it by lightly, and that I ought 
to impose a heavy fine. I believe that in so doing I shall 
benefit these defendants and every good citizen of this State 
if the size of the fine be such that every citizen, high or low, 
shall understand that this is a government of the law, am 
that the processes of the courts are to be obeyed, and tha 
every VTOBg may be righted in the orderly administration o 
affairs, and that no such proceedings of taking the law into 
uue's own hands as was initiated in Chicago can be tolerate&lt; 
anywhere. Three of these gentlemen voted against taking u 
these matters : Mr. Briscoe, Mr. Burks, and Mr. Cooper. Th 
fine imposed upon them will be $50 each. The mayor had n 
vote, but was enjoined from appointing an officer; he ha 
nothing to do with the removing of the petitioner. After 
that removal was accomplished, although the mandate forbade 
him to make an appointment, I can well see how one 
might say 'here is a vacancy of office, not by my action ; I can 
not leave the city of Lincoln without a police judge,' and so 
acted. The same fine will be imposed upon him. Upon the 
other eight the fine will be f600 upon each one. The order will 
be that they pay this fine and the costs of the proceedings 
and stand committed to the custody of the marshal until it 

Kudge Dundy followed, and in a terse and decisive way 
curred in the opinion of Judge Brewer. 

IFhe generous councilman who had promised to take care of 
s fines was immediately seen by his fellows, but his pocketik 
was as emaciated as himself, for it contained only f 10.13. 
was suggested by some that even that amount might have 
Ted to liquidate the fines, had not the witness on their 
lalf attributed to them such intelligence and characters as

I at might befall them, a complete record had boon made up, 
far as it had gone, preparatory for making an application 
the supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus. The record 
is completed, and Mr. Lambertson took the first train for 
ashington, D. C, and Marshal Bierbower took the prisoners 
the jail at Omaha, Neb. On the way to the jail Councilman 
jan grew weary. As they were passing a drug store he told 
e marshal that he was subject to fits and faintinirs, and, as 
felt his malady coming on, it was necessary for him to get 
me fit medicine. At the command of the marshal the proces»n 
halted. Dean left the ranks, satchel in hand, and entered 
e pharmacy. In a few moments he returned, apparently 
juvenated, but it was observed that his satchel possessed a 
ich greater specific gravity than when he left. When asked 
he expected to have fits enough to consume all that medile 
he replied he did not, but thought his companions might 
fore they got through. 

I They straightway awarded him a vote of thanks, and gave 
m the appellation of Dr. Dean, a name by which he was ever 
terwards recognized. 

I Dr. Dean now found no difficulty in keeping step, and they

e rugged way to the castle on the hill. 

The presence of so many fine looking gentlemen carrying 
krapsacks, marching in perfect order and martial array in 
that direction, excited no little curiosity. They were stared 
at by crowds of men and women, and great numbers of small 
boys followed the procession, while the dogs did bark as they

Thirty minutes in this revolting scene and breathing the 
fetid atmosphere caused a number of the city fathers to experience 
a feeling of nausea. This was observed by the quick 
eve of Dr. Dean. He rushed to his satchel, opened it, and took 
therefrom two huge quart bottles of "fit medicine." Holding 
them in either hand, he first took a doM himself and then 
passed the medicine bottles to his companions, assuring them 
that he had used the medicine for thirty years, and that it 
never failed to produce good results. The doctor's medicine 
came like a ray of sunshine into the midst of his companions. 
When the medicine bottle came to Burks he hesitated. He 
looked at the bottle, then at the surroundings, and then, addressing 
his fellow councilmen, said : "Boys, there is no use 
in talking; all the fit medicine in Christendom would not suffice 
to relieve me. I have been indisposed for more than a

in we quote from the same faithful chronicler: 

"About five o'clock the prisoners were shown to their apartments, 
which comprise two large rooms and a small room in 
the southeast corner of the second floor. They are scarcely 
dungeons in a literal sense of the word. The absence of 
chairs, racks, and thumbscrews is apparent to the most casual 
observer. A highly polished coal stove keeps out the cold air 
of November in the highest style of the art, while the floors 
are handsomely carpeted, and lounges and easy chairs are 
scattered around in a way that would have made John Bunyan 
write ten more chapters of his Pilgrim's Progress had he 
been confined here. Fragrant flowers are in the windows, 
while the walls are adorned with valuable pictures, among 
which is a chromo, presumably by Raphael, representing 
Judas Iscariot hanging himself. The distinguished prisoners, 
contend, however, that the moral value of the picture is impaired, 
as the only member of the body who could derive a 
valuable lesson from it is absent. Lace curtains adorn the 
windows, and handsome chandeliers furnish all the illumination 
desired. In short, the apartments now occupied by the 
city fathers of Lincoln are as comfortable as the homes of 
many aristocrats. It is not at all likely that groans, shrieks, 
or appeals for mercy will be heard by those without, unless it 
be as a result of some of Dean's jokes, which are constantly on 
draught and gnrgle around like flowing streams in deserts 
weary. Their confinement will lack many of the elements of </seg>

Ein the fourth day of their incarceration he dispatched the

Notwithstanding they were being daily besieged with kim 
friends, good cheer, and stahvart resolutions, they were be 
coming exceedingly anxious to learn what the supreme cour 
would say of them. "Eagerly they watched the morrow" fo

The council on receipt of the dispatch wired Mr. Lambertson

to bail, until the final decision, and at the same time 
be relieved from the expense of going to Washington.

ought to allow you to go on parole of honor. If not, writ will 
issue Monday. Dbn't give bail, for then the marshal could 
return that you were not in his custody. 

Pursuant to the above, Marshal Bierbower was seen, but he 
did not feel that he could take any action in the matter, as 
he derived his authority from Judge Brewer, whose mandate 
he must obey until he received orders from a higher power.

"Between the alternative of jail and asking Judge Brewer," 
says the chronicler, "the council determined to choose the 
jail." 

Later, however, the following dispatch was received : 

'¦Washington, D. C, December 3. 

("Senator Paddock and Congressman McShane went with 
\ Lambertson to see Attorney General Garland about adtting 
the mayor and city council to bail, or letting them 
t on parole of honor. The attorney general expressed great 
rprise that they should be imprisoned, and said that he 
uld direct the marshal at Omaha to place the prisoners 
tninally in the custody of the deputy marshal at their homes 
Lincoln until the case is finally decided by the court." 

Acting upon the order wired him by the attorney general, 
Marshal Bierbower placed the council in charge of Deputy 
United States Marshal Allen, who allowed them to return 
home on parole of honor to report to him should the decision 
of the supreme court be adverse. This brought great joy to 
the council, and they began to feel that genuine progress was 
now being made in their behalf. 

I They had now been in durance vile six days. Meanwhile

rstion of Federal judicial interference with municipal gov 
unent. He helieved they were right, and that they wouh

portance should lie speedily settled. Judicial tyraiim 
d lie, was the worst form of tyranny, and he hoped it woul

I No sooner had word that they were coining reached Lin 
1 than steps were taken to give them a fitting reception 
¦ time \v;is short, but the success of the event and larg 
liter who turned out demonstrated most clearly the pos 
i taken by the people of this city in this contest agains 
Federal usurpation of local authority. The city officers 
police and lire departments were out in force, togethe 
h a crowd of citizens, the whole headed by the K. P 
d, and about half past nine o'clock they proceeded in 
y to the B. &amp; M. depot. 

"When the train rolled in cheer after cheer rang out upo 
the night air. As many as could immediately mounted th 
car, and the meeting of old friends after years of separatio 
could not have been more enthusiastic. The mayor and coun 
cil were in charge of Deputy United States Marshal Allen 
who, in pursuance of the order previously mentioned, imme 
diately turned them over to the care of his deputy, Majo 
Hastings. When the councilmen were finally permitted t 
make their way out of the car they were hardly allowed t 
touch the ground before they were grasped by as many en 
thusiastic citizens as could get hold of them. As Mayo 
Sawyer appeared he was grasped by several strong arm. 
lifted above the heads of the crowd, and carried to the hea 
of the procession. When the vigor of the first greeting ha 
¦lightly subsided the company moved toward the counci 
chamber, led by the band playing Boulanger's march. Ar 
rived at this place the police and fire departments formed 
in lines on each side of the entrance way, and as each coun 
cilnian passed their ranks he was greeted with hearty cheers. 

Efany of Lincoln's prominent citizens delivered enthusic 
addresses of welcome and encouraged the council in the 
ef that the day of their final liberty was near at hand. 

Elen. Webster, being then called upon, made a few remarks 
coming the council to their accustomed places. The occa-1, 
he said, was one of the best of evidences that the Ameripeople 
are capable of self government. It is one of the </seg>

fundamental principles of the government under which we 
live that every municipality shall have the sole and uninterrupted 
administration of its own internal affairs, while to 
the geaenU government shall be relegated authority in affair** 
in which the whole country is involved, and between our 
own and other nations. The Federal court, he believed, had 
no more power to interfere in the local affairs of this city 
than had a justice of the peace in the state of Iowa. The 
fine, whether large or small, was a matter of comparative 
insignificance; but the principle of self government could 
not be overlooked. The speaker referred briefly to the manner 
in which the whole proceeding of the last few weeks in 
respect to the council of the city had been conducted. No 
force had been used and everything had been done in the 
most quiet and deliberate manner. It was not necessary, as 
has before been done in the history of the world, to tear down 
the Bastile, for in this land we depend on constitutional 
rights. It might have been possible to secure the desired 
writ from the supreme court of this State, but for fear of a 
(lash between state and Federal authority it was thought 
best to appeal to the highest judicial body in the land. He 
had, he said, no doubt whatever that the council would be 
discharged, and when they were the loyal citizens of this 
city would be out to celebrate the event with their biggest 
gun. At present the councilmen are still nominally prisoners. 
If the supreme court should determine that Judge 
Brewer had acted within his jurisdiction, it must be seen 
to that the representatives of this State in congress promulgate 
an amendment to the laws. Such a condition of affairs 
must not be allowed to exist in a free country. In closing 
he extended to the members of the council each and every 
one the heartiest welcome, and assured them that if their 
fines were not remitted it would be seen to that not a cent 
thereof should come out of their pockets, and that in this 
matter of vindicating their rights they have the sympathy 
of every good citizen. </seg>

Responses were made by the mayor and different members 
of the council, and they repaired to their homes happy in 
the thought that they were for the time released from imprisonment. 


IThe case had created great interest not only in Nebraska 
t throughout the United States. It had been widely comjnted 
upon by the press throughout the country, and, with 
e exception of the Omaha Republican, all the newspapers, 
far as we know, were a unit in defense of the position 
ken by the council. 

On the 12th of December, 1887, the case was most ably 
argued before the supreme court by attorneys G. M. Lambertson 
and L. C. Burr, who had filed elaborate briefs 
therein. 

It was expected that on the second Monday thereafter the 
court would hand down its opinion, and it was thought advisable 
that the defendants should have a representative 
present, that, in the event the opinion should affirm the 
decision of the lower court, an appeal might at once be had 
to the President. 

IThe mayor was accordingly chosen for this purpose, and, 
med with a petition for the pardon of the mayor and 
uncil, headed by His Excellency Governor Thayer, and 
jned by the state supreme judges, many district judges and 
ite officers, and other prominent citizens, he proceeded 
Washington, and was present on the coming in of the 
art on the day the decision was looked for. Case after case 
is handed down, but not the one in which he was particu•ly 
concerned. 

I As opinions are not given out by that tribunal, except on 
ondays, and as there was no certainty that the case would 
reached in a week from that time, he felt that he must 
turn home with nothing accomplished. Before returning, 
wever, it was his good fortune to meet Senators Manderq 
and Paddock, of Nebraska, who manifested great inter: 
in the cause and suggested that they go with him to the </seg>



            <seg id="p137">
President, that he might become acquainted with all the 
facts and circumstances. 

The invitation was gladly accepted. He was introduced 
to President Cleveland by Senator Maudersou, as the mayor 
of Lincoln, who was supposed to be in jail. At the same 
time both senators spoke a good word both for the mayor and 
his cause. 

The President accorded them a hearty welcome, then turning 
to the mayor he said, "My attention has already been 
called to the case through the press, and I would be pleased 
to learn more of its nature and the particular*.' 1 The Mayor 
then gave a brief history of the case in which the President 
seemed much interested, and inquired of the Mayor when he 
expected a decision. He told him that it was expected that 
a decision would be handed down to-day, but that he had 
just come from the court room and none had been reached. 
He then ventured to tell the President his purpose in being 
in the city, that in case of an emergency he might make an 
appeal for executive clemency. 

I! Executive smiled and inquired as to the political comm 
of the council. The mayor replied, nominally they 
11 republicans but two; practically they are all demoparticularly 
upon the main question — the right of 
self government. 

E'ell, for a fact," said he, "they do seem to be standing 
sound democratic principle — the doctrine of home rule. 
a principle that ought to be triuin pliant, and I have no 
t that it will." This he said with a degree of earnestness 
gave assurance that in an emergency an api&gt;eal might 
e in vain. 

The .Mayor returned home. All waited impatiently and 
most anxiously for four successive Mondays to learn their 
fate. At length on the 10th of January, 1888, the wires from 
Washington flashed the news that the council had won. The 
lower court had acted without jurisdiction, and all its acts 
were void. </seg>

had invaded the State, and news of a bloody battle in the 
cattle country was expected every hour. 

Tor five years condition! in the Wyoming cattle region 
had been tending toward conflict. Originally a few grea 
cattle companies, representing millions of dollars of capital 
had controlled the range. Then the frontier fanner am 
small stock man began to creep in and settle along th 
anis. They turned their few head of stock loose on th 
range along with those of the great cattle corporations. Th 
latter claimed that these few head multiplied with unhearc 
of fecundity — that many of these small stock men, beginnin 
with a yoke of steers and a branding iron, would in three 
or four years have one or two hundred head of increase — 
thereby more than fulfilling the scriptural promise to th 
careful liusliandman. The small stock men were denom 
inated "rustlers," which is plains dialect for cattle thief. Th 
rustlers promptly retorted with the counter-charge that th 
big companies, with their scores of riders, rounded up am 
branded the (stock of the small owners without regard to own 
ership, and pursued a policy of persecution intended to driv 
the small men from the homes they were trying to establis 
in the region claimed by the great cattle barons. The feelin 
between the two parties grew constantly more bitter. Hi 
l'Hious personal encounters took place. The small stoc 
men continued to pour into the region. The contest w:i 
carried into politics. The rustler element had more votes 
and, after heated campaigns, had elected officers who sym 
pathized with their cause in most of the cattle counties. Th 
large cattle companies controlled the state legislature am 
had enacted two laws for their own protection. One was th 
cattle commission law which authorized a commission (com 
posed of friends of the large companies) to keep agents a 
the great stockyards in Omaha, Kansas City, and elsewhere 
with power to seize and confiscate cattle when shipped there 
if they WCTC not satisfied of their ownership. The other la\ 
fixed dates for the annual roundup in different districts. </seg>

tie small stock men in the Pow.der river region had expn 
purpose to hold their own roundup at a date that suited 
emselves, regardless of the law. 

I So matters stood when the armed bodj of mounted nagem 
Mppe&amp;red over the Wyoming hills in the direction of the 
iwder river region. 

It was two days later — the morning of April 12th — when 
the occupants of the "K. C." ranch on Little Powder river, 
about sixty miles north of Douglas, began to bestir themselves 
for breakfast. There were two occupants ordinarily 
— Nick Kay and Nate Champion — small stock men belonging 
to the rustler faction. The night before two trappers, 
one an old man named Benjamin Jones, the other a young 
man named William Walker, had pitched their camp on the 
river near the ranch. The K. C. ranchmen had invited them 
into the cabin for the sake of company, always prised in those 
remote regions. After supper they had beguiled the night 
until a late hour with stories of frontier life and adventure. 
At daylight the next morning the old trapper Jones was list 
up. He took a pail and started down to the spring a few 
rods distant for water. lie was astonished to find the ravine 
filled with armed men. A dozen rifles covered him, and he 
was ordered to come forward and surrender. He did so, and 
was placed under guard. After quite an interval, smoke was 
¦seen coming from the cabin stove-pipe. Then the JOUget 
trapper came down the hill, looking for his comrade. He 
was promptly taken under guard. Another interval followed. 
One of the ranchmen came out. "Don't shoot, wait for the 
other," said a man in command. Presently the other man 
came out. He apparently caught sight of something wrong, 
for he instantly started back into the cabin, just as the command 
"Fire'' was given, and his companion fell, pierced by 
twenty bullets, in the doorway. His body was dragged in 
by the survivor, who immediately opened a vigorous Ire upon 
his assailants. For four or five hours the battle of sixty 
against one continued. Finally the attacking party set tire </seg>

I The remainder of the story of the Wyoming raid must bo 
ry briefly told. The firing at the K. C. ranch had been 
urd, and within a few hours the story of its dead bodies 
d thai-red ruins was Hying over the cattle range. A body 
two hundred armed rustlers gathered under command of 
d Angus, sheriff of the county. The invaders attempted 
force their way across the country to Ft McKinney and 
in the protection of the military, but the uprising of the 
all stock men was too quick for them, and they were driven 
hay at the T. A. ranch, a few miles north of the scene of 
! killing of Champion and Kay. Here they were cut off 
mi communication and provisions, and a siege and battle 
lowed. The sheriff's forces' were rapidly advancing a line 
ritle pits upon the ranch, and the destruction of the entire 
re was a matter of only a few hours, when they were res•d 
bj Col. Vanllorn and three companies of D. 8. regus, 
which had Marched from Ft. McKinney to their relief

the t&gt;th Cavalry, escorted them to Douglas, where they wer

After betag kept in the r"ort a few days, they were admittex 
to hail in the courts at Cheyenne, and the great Wyomin 
cattle raid was ended. 

The two trappers, Jones and Walker, were captured along 
with the "regulators." They were demanded and secured by 
local authorities, and placed in the Douglas jail against the 
time of trial of the cattle barons. They were the only wit•rs 
of the murder of Champion and Bay. Their lips were 
the only ones that could ever he compelled to tell in a court 
of justice the story of the tragedy at the solitary ranch on 
Powder river. The murderers were millionaires. The unwilling 
witnesses were poor, unsophisticated trappers. It 
was imperative that they he got out of the country. 

A livery stable keeper in Douglas was entrusted with th 
job. He gained access to the witness-prisoners, told them 
they would surely be killed if they staid in Wyoming to 
ify. ami that if they would go with him they should be 
given plenty of money and got out of the country safely. On 
the night of May 3, 1892, the jail was opened in some mys 
terious way, the two prisoners- and the livery man mounted 
three swift horses, and by riding all night reached the Ne!-raska 
line the next day. They took the Elkhorn train fo 
Crawford, where they expected to board the B. &amp; M. nigh 
train and get out of the country. They were stopped a 
Crawford, however, by Constable Morrison, who had a telegram 
from the Wyoming authorities asking him to hold them 
until officers from there could arrive. Something had to be 
done quickly or the whole plan of abduction would fail. Tele

the return of the witnesses to Wyoming in any possible way. 

Following these instructions the Nebraska lawyers secura 
a writ of habeas corpus from S. If. Ballard, county judge o 
Dawes county, paid seventy-five dollars for a special trai 
from Chadron to Crawford, brought the two witnesses 1 
Chadron, and lodged them in the county jail, where the write 
of this article first met them and learned from their own lips 
the story of the murders at K. C. ranch and the subsequen 
vicissitudes they had undergone. Both of them were singu 
larly simple-minded, child-like persons, with very little edu 
cation. All their lives had been spent on secluded frontie 
farms or in trapping. They seemed dazed with the swi 
succession of events that had befallen them, from the burn 
ing of the K. C. ranch, through the siege at T. A. ranch, tl 
capture by the soldiers, the Douglas jail, the flight and a 
rest. They sincerely believed their lives were in great peri

re not spirited away.

liquors to Indians. No one but those in charge of that side o 
the case knew of this. The hearing of the habeas corpus case 
\v;is set for ten o'clock. Before that time the court room \va 
crowded. Rumor had gone out that the U. S. marshal wouU 
attempt to seize the witness!-* and earn them off, and man. 
of the small stock men living around (Jhadrou had come in — 
some of them armed — to witness the proceedings. 

I Phe trappers were brought into court and seated together 
rshal Ilepfinger immediately took a chair next to them 
the right and the Douglas liveryman the one on the left 
ter counsel on both sides had made their argument on 
¦ legal question involved — which was whether the pris 
an were lawfully held by Constable Morrison and shouk 
returned to the Wyoming authorities — the honorabl 
mty court relieved himself of a very large section of plu 
iacco and began slowly to deliver his opinion. After re 
wing the case the court said, "I therefore find that these 
n are held without legal authority and" — here the cour 
ked significantly at .Marshal Ilepfinger and uttered th 
rds quickly — "Discharge the prisoners." 

Instantly the deputy marshal sprang to his feet, placed 
hand on each of the trappers and exclaimed, "You are m 
prisoners." At the same time Sheriff James C. Dahlman 
now one of the state board of transportation, placed hi 
hands upon them and produced a warrant, saying, "These 
men belong to me." Dahlman represented the Wyomin 
authorities, and his papers were designed to return the w\ 
m&gt;ses to Douglas. There was intense excitement in th 
room. A hundred men sprang upon chairs and tables an 
formed a circle in whose center were the two trappers, tl 
deputy I'. S. marshal, and the Nebraska sheriff. Every on 
looked for a tight, and there was not much doubt on whic 
side the great majority present stood. The deputy marsh; 
had produced a bundle of glittering steel as he spoke, am 
with the aid of the livery man and another assistant, prt

Ethis contention. I shall never forget the appealing, 
-stricken look in the eyes of old trapper Jones as the 
cuffs and leg-iroM were fastened on his limbs and he 
1 around him at tliat circle of intense faces. 

icanwhile the opposing attorneys came forward— with 
praiseworthy ambition of their class to prevent all cons 
except those which involve a payment of fees. After a 
(Mged conference, if was announced that Sheriff DahlreliiKiuislicd 
Iiis claim to the men. The reason given at 
time was that the Wyoming local authorities could not 
up a sufficient financial guarantee to protect the sheriff 
from possible loss if he endeavored to hold the prisoners and 
became thereby involved in litigation. There was no lack of 

"liiiniu-ial guarantee" on the cattle barons' side of the case. 
I have it from the lips of those who know that a cash deposit 
of one hundred and twenty dollars was made by that side of 
the case with the county judge to "meet all possible co&gt; 
as it was phrased. None of this money was ever paid back or 
accounted for, and the present county judge of Dawes county 
writes me, under date of December 28, 1896, that he has diligently 
searched all the records in his office and nowhere in 
then is there a trace of this important habeas corpus c 
for which a fee deposit of one hundred and twenty dollars 
\\ M made. Nor is there any record in the papers of the U. S. 
nit. court commissioner at Chadrou of the complaint 
sworn to or warrant issued in this case. 

I tie moment it was announced by the lawyers that Sheriff 
lman's claim for the prisoners was withdrawn, the U. 8. 
it.y marshal pushed the two trappers through the crowd 
hustled them at as rapid a gait as they could walk down 
middle of the street toward the depot. That May day

¦ir haste flashed into our minds. A t urn of the street corr 
confirmed the Hash. There stood a special train beaded 
&lt;t. with hot hissing steam blowing off from the engine. The 
S. marshals, the lawyers, the trappers, and the circuit 
irt commissioner hurried on board. Two short shrieks 
&gt;m the locomotive, and the train was moving. Before half 
&gt; following crowd had reached the platform it had disapired 
beyond the hills of the Bordeaux valley. 

Two hundred and eighty dollars was the price paid for 
ic service of the special train. It ran a hundred miles cist 
i Cody, a little station in the very center of the Cherry 
unity sand-hills. There it halted, and, after telegraphic 
•uimunication with Cheyenne and Omaha, the party got oil", 
n a few hours they were joined from the east by deputy I".

e now residents of Lincoln. They had left Fremont that 
oniag with instructions from the 1*. S. marshal's oflice at 
maha to go to Chadroa and secure the trappers. On their 
ay up the Elkhorn valley they had been apprised by tele•aph 
that Deputy Hepflnger had succeeded in the task, and 
ere ordered to go to Cody to meet and assist him if needed. 

The prisoners, worn out with excitement and anxiety, were 
permitted to lie down on the depot floor and sleep, while the 
rest of the party passed the time with cards until the arrival 
of the east-bound express, which they boarded for Omaha. 

[The entire party arrived in Omaha at 530 P.M. the next 
JT. They were met at the depot by Attorney Frank Uanin, 
since then president of the Nebraska senate, who had 
en retained by the Cheyenne cattle barons. They were

bail was required for their appearance to answer the

r HMgh frontier trapper costumes replaced with new 
s of clothes and then driven to the Missouri Pacific night 
11, in charge of a man directed to take them to St. Louis. 

This is as far as I have been able authentically to trace 
their story. I am informed by those in a position to kno'w 
that they were to be given $:'&gt;,000 each, and from St. Louis 
were to be sent to Mexico, but my informant was unable to

18J9. 

I arrived at Omaha on the second trip there by the steame 
so named, in the spring of 1855, forty three years ago, and 
is like yesterday. V. Berkley, A. If. Snyder, and Theo 
Dodge were uaoag the passengers with whom I became ver 
intimate. Parker, the United States land register, was als 
along. It had been raining very hard for a few days, bu 
cleaned off warm the morning we arrived, a lovely May morn 
ing. I remember seeing Captain Moore and Wm. Clance 
Manding conspicuously on the town site not far from the Ape 
saloon, kept by Kimball, and pointing out city lots to new a 
rivals. One of our passengers, a German, had bought a lot i 
&lt; &gt;maha from some speculator on board for about $100. It wa 
in it far from the Douglas House towards the river. It was par 
of a ravine, "a hole in the ground," and he made an awfu 
fuss. We all sided with him, saying it was a perfect swindl 
"The price was awful for a mere hole in the ground," wa 
the general opinion, so green were we newcomers on wester 
lot speculations. My recollection is that the man or son 
other one, got $SmO for the hole soon after. Mills was ru 
ning the Douglas Ilouse and taking in more money than ever 
body else, as prices for rooms were very high. Augu 
Kountze, who was a passenger, and myself occupied adjoi

ritory. It was right on the river and "had a permanent landing." 
It was exactly "opposite the great north bend of the 
Platte," — therefore sure to be a railroad terminus. W« 
wandered along on foot for some distance, accompanied by a 
lot of Indians. These were escorting a white girl, who rode 
a pony and seemed to belong to them. Footsore and weary, 
we by sundown found a man named Judge McDonald "holding 
a claim"' in the high grass. Mho pointed us to Fort Calhoun, 
where we could be lodged. By dusk we got there. There 
were but two or three cabins on the whole town site. A large 
double cabin with an upstairs was the hotel, kept by George 
Stevens. Well, we had a food supper and rested, and were 
refreshed. Old Mr. Mather, the father of Mrs. Stevens, his 
wife, aud son Ed, a young man, were members of the household. 
Mrs. Stevens, a kind lady and splendid housekeeper, 
made it like home. In pleasant converse the evening was 
passed. In the morning we admired the exceeding beauty of 
the situation. In truth there are no lovelier landscapes than 
all along the Missouri river, and right there was one of the 
most glorious scenes eye ever beheld — as nature left it. W« 
went up to De Soto, greatly disappointing the friends we had 
made, who hoped to retain us as citizens of Fort Calhoun. We 
were greatly disappointed at De Soto — a cluster of cabins in a 
hollow by the river. We found nobody, and nothing there to 
invite us. One kept the hotel and Bill Clancey ran 
the town, though he lived mostly at Omaha. There was a 
place, called Cuming City after Secretary of State Cuming, 
a few miles above on a fine site, but far from the river. 
Jim Stewart, a prominent citizen there, I soon after made acquaintance 
with. Both the places have departed the earth, 
and their very sites have been forgotten. The river is now 
miles away from where De Soto was, as it once was where 
Fort Calhouu now is. 

Returning, we stopped again at Fort Calhoun, and when I

crowds, and dissipations of Omaha. I had no idea that 
Omaha would ever become of much account. In fact then 
were fifty town-sites equally ambitious. So I returned to

family. Amid their primitive times and ways, I never 
enjoyed my life more. We were all contented, hopeful, and 
eijual. About a dozen more houses were put up there that

Perkins and old man Allen. Lumber was in such demand 
that many teams from even near Omaha would be seen waiting 
for their turn to be laden. At one time eottonwood 
brought fl50 per thousand. These men got their logs right 
around them at no cost whatever for one stick — mill right in 
the vast woods of the bottoms — and yet ran in debt, rarely 
paid their hands, and just hobbled along. Bad management.

his place in an old cabin by the river bluffs, a remnant of the 
old fort itself — the place being the original Council Bluff. 
The river, with its surround ing bluffs, enclosing a vast 
amphitheater some twenty or more miles in diameter, and 
the Indian name, we were told, signifies "the Council IMuffs." 
Bj the way, the Indians told me that Omaha means "Against 
Current," A tribe of lower Missouri dividing — one part 
ing "Omaha," against current, the other "Xemaha," with 
current. Well, Davis was surrounded by the Fort Calhoun 
town speculators. Some firing began — he shot one dead and 
badly wounded another, and then the surrounders dispc 
— carrying their dead and wounded with them to Council 
Bluffs, where they belonged. Davis got away somehow and 
matters were settled. There were several murders on account 
of claim jumping — the jumpers often proceeding under 
tb«' United States pieemption act, giving KJO acres, while 
claims were 320 acres under club law and as much as one 
could buy. The first building called a court house ever put 
up in Nebraska was erected at Tort Calhoun about July,

the first building designed and built for that sole, distinct purpose, 
and I helped raise it. When done, we had a few remarks 
on the occasion, after our American custom, to the effect 
that "We here, a few pioneers, were laying the foundations 
of empire, and humble as were our beginnings, some of us 
might live to see these lovely landscapes now resting under 
the adornments of nature, crowded with industrious populations 
and dotted everywhere with cities, towns, splendid 
villages, and with temples towering toward the heavens of the 
everlasting God." These remarks were made by the venerable 
Mr. Mather, a splendid old man of antique type, in whose

The winter of 1S."»( "&gt;-,") 7, ushered in by a deep snow about 
December 1 of nearly four feet, ending with a blizzard, was 
long and severe. Many of us had never seen a blizzard, and 
nearly lost our lives by exposure. At one time the mercury 
at Port Calhoun stood forty decrees below zero, and the

al 23 decrees below zero all day, we had such a time as 
is rarely felt. Snow Mew several inches deep into most

a Mg immigration, and yet your vile immigration laws keeplag 
it out. The Indians wandered up and down in large numbers 
and had plenty of meat from the dead cattle 1 vi n.u; 
around. Wolves, too, were abundant, and deer would not 
get out of our path to walk on the crusted snow that broke 
ami cut their leg*. Hundreds were thus killed bj- a blow 
from a club, and for a time venison was about our whole

the old exchange bank. Others opposed it, but finally we 
stopped. In the saloon was a man by the name of Grant, 
electioneering for Col. Thayer for Congress. I told him 
Thayer was my man, as he was the only anti-Nebraska bill 
democrat running. 

"Let me introduce you and we will fix things." An intro 
duction followed. I agreed to work for Thayer. I arrange* 
how we should carry Washington county unanimously fo 
him. I was to pretend to oppose him bitterly and that wouh 
fix about two-thirds — my enemies — for him. And I had onl 
to whisper to my friends. This indirect way puzzled Thayer 
but I assured him it would work. Then I went to work doin 
all I could for him south of IMatte, going up and down on 
steamboats and other ways. Thayer was beaten, but ou 
county went almost to a man for him. In electioneering 
made many acquaintances and friends, so when I left Hi 
braska, being ill, I concluded to stop here (Oregon) for a da. 
or two before going down into Arkansas. I never dreame&lt; 
of staying here. I was in low spirits, glad no one knew me, in 
my reversed fortunes. But I saw there was some mone, 
here, gold, and considerable traffic. As I walked out, th 
first person I met was a gentleman I had learned to know 
while electioneering for Thayer. He recognized me forth 
with and introduced me to all the people we met on the 
street, and nothing would do but I must stop here and open 
out a law office. He assured me plenty of business. All th 
people I met were equally urgent. I finally did so, and soon 
had a thriving business. But for having met Thayer I neve 
had made the man's acquaintance. 

Early in 1861, as I was going up to Nebraska on a boat, 
Lincoln's new governor was aboard. AVe became well acquainted. 
Learning I was an old settler, he very earnestly 
asked me who was a fit man for him to make the Colonel of 
the First regiment, then forming. I assured him that there

skill or love of military life, and that was John M. Thayer, </seg>

DEATH OF LOGAN FONTANELLE. 

Prepared by T. H. Tibbies from Story by Iron Ej-e. 

I don't know about your years exactly, but I thiuk it was 
in July and the year 185G. We went out toward the Pawmr 
reserve to hunt. We camped near the creek called by the 
Omahas, Beaver creek. That was the first year we went 
buffalo hunting along the Elkhorn (after v.e came to this 
reserve). We advanced, crossed the Elkhorn, and came to another 
stream that flows into the Platte. In going forward we 
came across buffalo twice. As we went forward, toward sundown, 
Louis Sansouci went up on the hills to keep an outlook 
and saw a Sioux. I saw his signal and ordered him to 
come back. I took the swift horses and the young men and 
gave chase, and all the camp followed on after us. We were 
about three miles ahead of the main body, and it was about 
sundown when we caught sight of the Sioux by the flash of 
the sun on a gun barrel, as they lay hid in the fgnm. As it 
was getting dark, I ordered the Omahas to stop, for I felt 
sure* that the Sioux would attac-k us (luring the night. I sent 
out ten young men with the swiftest horses to keep watch. 
They got between some of the Sioux and their main body, 
and an Omaha, the oldest one among them, got so near a 
Sioux that he tried to strike him while he (the Sioux) was 
alive, instead of killing him as he ought to have done, and the 
Siuux escaped. The Sioux ran back and got behind some 
woods and then suddenly dashed out and killed this Omaha. 
Our young men fell back, but they left one wounded Omaha 
on the field. I held a council. Logan said, "We will go back 
in the night, bury our dead, and get the wounded,'' but I said

"No; we will prepare the camp to fight, ami if they attack \

found Sansouci still alive; the other was dead. Near tli 
place the Sioux attacked us again. I took ten young men, a

the Sioux made a dash and killed him. After that the youn 
men followed me instead of going ahead. I pushed on vei 
hard after the Sioux, but could not find them. There wer 
only three of these Sioux, and Spotted Tail was one of them 
It was Spotted Tail who killed the man. Spotted Tail ha( 
his wifc with him, and she was in the Sioux camp at that tim 
The present Spotted Tail was in the camp also. lie was tiet 
on a board. Spotted Tail was a foolish young man at tha 
time. He had a fast horse, and when all the Sioux were i 
plain sight he rode alone almost into the Omaha cam] 
Twice he did it, with our young men shooting at him. I wa 
on the other side of the camp, too far away to get a shot. A 
of the Sioux were swinging their blankets and calling fo 
him to come back. When be was older he would not b^ 
done so foolish a thing. 

I After that the Sioux moved away, apparently going back 
their reservation. I sent men who followed their trail a 
ng way. We camped where we were and buried our dead, 
e could not give up the hunt, for it was our only means of 
ing. We moved slowly along Beaver creek, going toward 
e Pawnee agency, and camped at a fork of the creek. I 
lied a good many elk. Logan had a splendid bay mare that 
had given him. She was the fastest horse in the Omaha

That morning an old man had borrowed my hunting knif 
and did not give it back. I turned the horse loose and sa 
down to have a rest and a smoke. Just then I looked back an; 
saw the Sioux coining up on both sides of the Omahas, wh 
were on the inarch. The Sioux were jelling with all thei 
might, and that frightened my horse, and it was with grea 
difficulty that I crawled op to him and caught him. I hat 
tied the elk on with such hard knots that I could not quickl 
untie them, and I had no knife to cut the lariat. So I jumpei 
on the horse, heavy loaded as he was, and made a dash for ou

killed and scalped him. The:i they retired to the brush where 
I had killed the elk, which was a foolish thing for them to do 
for while they were there I got the camp together and th

killed and one man wounded.

REMINISCENCES OF THE CRUSADE IN NEBRASKA. 

Mrs. Harriet W. Leighton. 

Irhis midwinter meeting of the old settlers' reunion has bee 
ked forward to with happy anticipations by each member 
m sure. In my poverty of expression 1 have been requests 
write, for this occasion, a few reminiscences of "Nebrask 
iman's Crusade," that wonderful uprising of women whic 
:urred December, 1873 and 1874. In behalf of the nobl 
men who participated in that movement, many of whom 
» yet doing yeoman's work in their struggle with one of th 
;atest problems of the age, I take pleasure in acceding t 
j request. 

IFhere have been crusades and crusades, but only on 
Roman's Crusade." Many times has the question bee 
ced, "What necessitated the crusade?'' What its mission 
e spiritual vision necessary to a correct understanding o 
riptural truth is the only medium through which the cru 
le can be intelligently discerned and its mission inte 
?ted. The esprit de corps of the inspired army of Christia 
men will always be an enigma to those who never cam 
thin the radius of its divine influence. The movement ha&lt; 
precedent. It owed its origin to no church, organization 
individual. Neither was it the result or outgrowth of pre 
ius effort. It was independent of all human agencies, ex 
)t as individuals were used as (iod's instruments. "It 
the Lord" was the universal sentiment. 

{The crusade, we believe, was a call from God to the women

e world, making known the enormity and strength to which </seg>

the gigantic liquor traffic had grown. The hour was crucial. 
Four years of civil war had left its blight upon the morals of 
the people. Temperance laws, when any existed, were dead 
letters on statute books. Reform sentiment had ebbed down 
to the low, dead levels of despair and apathy. Old Method*

hopes, wrecking the brightest intellects, and making an army

A great cry went up to God from stricken homes. It was th 
BgyptiMM cry. The dead were there, slain through stron 
drink. Father, son, husband, brother, and the whole lane 
moaned. Hundreds and thousands of the flower of America 
manhood were bound in chains to the monster Alcohol. Thou 
sands annually scourged to death by this haughty Xero. Ten 
of thousands of mothers were weeping, begging piteously fo 
life of sons, heart-broken wives pleading for idolized hus 
bands; and while their prayer was yet on their white lips, th 
poor, degraded, dishonored victims were launched into 
drunkard's eternity, unprepared. Thousands of new devotees 
were constantly pressing forward into the ranks of drunk 
ards; for the sacrifice of human life was unceasing, and, wit

womanhood of the land, "Arise! go forward!" 

II t has always been a precious thought to me that whenever 
e Lord has a work to be done He has somebody ready to do 
In this work it was to be that of woman. It was through 
e discipline of great sorrow and suffering that the women 
this land were prepared for the work God had for them 
do. 

End's command was heeded, and women went out from paland 
cottage to help redeem our native land from its greatfoe. 
The banner of the cross was spread over them, and

I The crusade fire first began in southern Ohio, at Hills 
ro, where the liquor traffic for weeks was shaken to its 
nter. Phenomenal was the success attending the wor 
erywhere as it spread from town to city, city to state. Th 
lole country was startled at the uprising. It was like th 
ing of the first gun at Fort Sumter. At once it became th 
pic of the religious and secular press. It was discussed i 
nters of trade, on street corners, everywhere all over th 

I The idea of saloon visitation, at first, was appalling to 
ltured, Christian women. Many a one said, "Surely God 
es not require this of me!" Yet, after going to their 
bles and closets for light and guidance, God revealed to 
em His will. Many responded, saying "Here, Lord, am I! 
nd me!" Hundreds went out who had never before heard 
e sound of their own voices in public. The joy that came to 
ch woman that participated in the crusade will only be exeded 
in the Great Beyond. 

The work continued to spread. Women prayed in billiard 
rooms and before bars. Their voices were heard in beer gardens, 
in warehouses, and along the docks. Songs and prayers 
were heard above the confusion that reigned. Never were 
such prayers offered, and such earnest appeals, as during the 
crusade. In some of the larger cities the women were mobbed </seg>

ital city, the light of which may never grow dim.

A feeling of tender compassion for the suffering multitud

I[ seem to hear again the singing of the "Hock of Ages"

heaven's altar from saloon centers. It tells that "the battle 
on." An inspiration from the God of Battles fired the 
arts of these women led by brave leaders, many of whom

is that of Andrew's. For men to enter a saloon was no unual 
sight, but for women to enter such doors to sing and 
ay was a sight upon which God and Ilis angels had never 
&gt;ked down before.

with fear and trembling, yet firm in their belief of duty, joining 
bands with each other, lest their courage should fail them 
while in this den of death. Our sainted Mrs. Hardy said to 
the writer that the saloon was as near like unto the description 
of the infernal regions as it would be able to liken a 
place unto. Here was heard the clinking of glasses; the most 
fearful oaths ever uttered over gambling scenes. Here was 
seen the passing in and out of young men with life and hope 
before them, old men with life and hope behind thorn; gray 
hair in the saloon, and clustering brown curls, dignified, 
manhood, those who like to be called business men, men in respectable 
places, men wielding the pen that educates the 
world — this was the class of men they found inside of those 
walls. What a revelation! What a train of unthougbt and 
unseen things startled the vision of these women ! How their 
hearts went out in motherly sympathy to the sweet, boyish 
faces of many a beautiful boy away from home, and the 
mother whose hauds had lovingly caressed him. Stirring addresses 
were made and appeals given asking each to reform 
and lead a new life. Pledges were given by some present, who 
resolved to live a life of sobriety henceforth. 

In Kleutsch's saloon the band gathered for service one 
ight. There was present also a large gathering of men. 
'he prayer and song service had closed and the women had 
ust crossed the threshold of the saloon, going to their homes, 
hen suddenly the floor gave way, but God shielded the 
omen from harm and danger. One other evening they were 
olding a meeting in the same saloon, when suddenly the 
ights were extinguished. The proprietor made his exit anil 
ocked the praying women inside. They went on with their 
ongs and prayers in the darkness. At a late hour the back 
oor was taken off its hinges, and the women, like unto 
)aniel in the lions' den, escaped unharmed. By whom God 
sent His delivering anjrel it is not known to this day. 

Day and night were these meetings held in different saloons 
and elsewhere. Liquor dealers blanched white as they saw </seg>

the women, numbering hundreds, entering their strongholds 
of sin. The effect on proprietor and customers was overwhelming. 
Where bacchanalian revel and riots had heretofore 
beea held, now ascended a volume of prayers. 

IS'o liquor dealer did a flourishing business while the era 
le continued. In some instances the women took wit 
in jK-ncil and book, recording the names of men they foun 
these dark places of sin. In a short time not many men 
lenibled in such places, except a large number who gathered

ise of homes. 

ilany touching instances occurred which time does no 
mit my mentioning. For two months the crusading w; 
t up in our city. TJie saloon keepers asked for protectio 
m the women of the city council. The city council the 
scd an ordinance in behalf of the men to protect men — no 
women. The ordinance read that not more than on 
nan at a time should enter any saloon, nor more than t\\ 
gregate on the street. The active form of the crusac 
rtly ceased. 

The first work the women did after disbanding was to organize 
a reading-room for the benefit of young men, making 
I home for many who were strangers here in a strange city. 
From that snail beginning has grown our present city 
library, of which all are justly proud. It was our crusade 
women largely who laid the foundations and paved the way 
for the charitable institutions in our midst. 

Largely is it due also to these women, their influence and 
effort* that we are to-day called a city of churches and 
schools, with religious and educational privileges unexcelled. 
Tor the fact that we are also a city of saloons, we are willing 
that the manhood of the city should have the credit.

Union." The phase of singing and praying on the </seg>

Elany criticised and jeered at the work at first, and said, 
lose women will accomplish nothing!" But God did not 
?nd that woman, in a few weeks or months, should anniite 
a traffic as old as the world itself and wipe out an evil 
t men had been battling for a century without. It was 
y the beginning of the end. 

Erhe traffic touched by woman's finger and God's voice is

re than the agitation it has brought about, it would have 
ae a noble work. It has brought an arrest of thought on 
s question that has come to stay. 

' The world is awake and its ear is set. 
Its lips are apart, and its eyelids wet." 

No intelligent person now believes that the liquor traffic 
will be much longer legalized by Christian nations. The 
watchword of the hour is, "Outlaw the saloon — protect the 
home." 

trhe age of sobriety is marching on. It will be brought

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

ALONG THE OVERLAND TRAIL IN NEBRASKA 

Prepared by Gilbert L. Cole, Beatrice, Nrb., for the Annual Meeting of 
the Nebraska State Historical Society, January 10, 1900. 

On the lGth of March, 1S52, I started with several others 
from .Monroe, Mick., on the overland trail to California. 
Nothing of interest occurred during our travel through the 
States, except the general very bad roads, causing us to make 
poor progress. Crossing the Mississippi at Warsaw, 111., we 
we kept along the northern tier of counties in Missouri, which 
was heavily timbered and sparsely settled. Bearing southwest 
we arrived at St. Joseph, Mo., on the first day of May. 
The town was a collection of one-story, cheap, wooden buildings, 
located along the river and up Rattlesnake Hollow. 
The inhabitant! appeared to be chiefly French and half-breed 
Indians. The principal business was in selling outfits to the 
immigrants, trading in horses, mules, and cattle. The level 
part below the town was (lie camp of the immigration. There 
was one steam ferryboat, which had several days crossing 
ahead of us registered. So the next day we started and 
drove up to Savannah. After laying in some more supplies ire 
drove to the Missouri river at what was called Savannah 
Landing. There we crossed over on a hand ferry, and for the 
first time we pressed the soil of the then unsettled plains of 
the Cicat West. Working our way through the heavily 
timbered bottom, we tamped under the hluffs, wet and 

IHere we rested over Sunday, when we completed our comny

morning at sunrise we started on a trail that led up the 
hollow and on to the "great plains'' of Kansas and Nebraska. 
The day was warm and the sun shone bright and clear. 
To me, as well as the others, it was the most beautiful sight 
I had ever seen. Not a tree or any obstacle could be seen before 
us; only this great rolling sea of the brightest green. 
This, then, was the land that we were told, in later years,-was 
the "Great American Desert." We have often heard it 
expressed from the rostrum and pulpit, inviting us to look 
about and see what was a half century ago a ''barren, sandy 
iliscrt," and tfcej said it was so represented by the early immigrants 
to California. True, one spoke of the deserts in 
Nebraska, but they are now in Nevada, for we stepped out 
of Nebraska into California, *on the summit of the Sierra 
Nevada mountains. Having lived here twenty-one years, I 
know the grass was then as good as it lias been any year 
since. The first Indians we saw were at Wolf creek, where 
they had made a bridge of logs and brush, and charged us 
fifty cents a wagon to pass over it. We paid it and drove on, 
mining now to the vicinity of the Big Blue river at a point 
about where Baraeston, Gage county, is now located. 

Our company, as organised, consisted of twenty-four men 
and one woman, the wife of W. W. Wadsworth, our captain. 
We had eight wagons and forty-seven head of horses and 
mules. Four men were detailed each night to stand guard — 
two till one o'clock, when they were relieved by two others, 
who came in at daylight. As a couple of horsemen were riding 
in advance we came suddenly to the Big Blue river, 
where, on the opposite bank, stood a party of thirty or forty 
Indians. We fell back, and when the train came up a detail 
was made of eight men to drive the teams, and the other 
sixteen were to wade the river, rifle in hand, to see what the 
Indians were going to do. Being one of the skirmish line, I 
remember how clear and blue the water was, and as to depth, 
it came into our vest pockets. We walked up to the Indians 
and said "How?" and had some presents of copper cents </seg>

and tobacco to offer them. We soon saw that they were 
merely looking to see us ford the stream. They were Paw 
MO, were gaily dressed, and armed with bows and arrows. 
We passed several pipes IMI| tliein, and the train was 
signaled and all came through the ford without any trouble, 
the water coming up four to six inches in the wagOB beds. 
After the train was out in the open prairie again, we bad.' 
the Indians good-bye, and were all glad we got off so easily. 
At noon we moved otF the trail, turned out the animals, ami 
all hands proceeded to dismount the wagon* and spread 
their contents out on the graai to dry. as everything next to 
the bottom of the wagon beds was staked with water. I forto 
say that in making preparations to ford the river, n 
a precaution of safety, the captain had placed his wife down 
in the bottom of their wagon bed and piled sacks of flour 
around her as protection in case of a light, and of course in 
passing the ford she was necessarily drawn through the 
water in a very alarming and uncomfortable manner. But 
¦he was one of the bravest of women, and in this instance, as 
in many others of danger and fatigue before we reached our 
journey's end, she always displayed such courage and good 
temper as to win the admiration of all the company. 

We now moved on, I think, in the direction of Dillcr am 
EndtCOtt, where we joined the main line of immigration con 
ing through from St. Joe, and crossing the Big Blue whet 
Marysville. Kan., is located. We were soon coming up th 
J.ittle Blue, passing up on the east side and about one mil 
this side of Fairlmry. Our trail lay along the upland 
through the day, where we could see the long line of covere 

wagons, sometimes two or three abreast, drawing itself in its 
windings like a great white snake across this great sea of 
rolling green. This line could be seen many miles to the 
front and rear, so far that the major portion of it seemed 
to the observer to be motion!' 

I We now came to a stream called the Big Sandy (I believe 
is in the vicinity of Fillmore county) about 9:00 a.m., </seg>

when we were alarmed by.the unearthly whoops and yells of 
a hundred or more Indians (Pawnees), all mounted and rid- 
Ittg up and down across the trail on the open upland opposite 
us at about a good rifle-shot distance. Oil company wore the 
only people there, and a courier was immediately sent back 
for reinforcements. We hastily put our camp in position of 
defense I as we had been drilled ) by placing our wagons in a 
circle with our stock and ourselves on the inside. The Indians 
constantly kept up their yells and rode up and down, 
brandishing their arms at us, and we thought that every 
minute they would make a break for us. We soon had recruits 
mounted and well-armed coining up, when our captain 
assumed command and all were assigned to their positions. 
This was kept up until about one o'clock, when we 
decided that our numbers would warrant us in making a forward 
movement. As a preliminary, skirmishers were ordered 
forward down towards the creek through some timber 
and thick underbrush, I being ordered with them. My partner 
and myself, on coming to the creek, first discovered an 
empty whisky barrel, and going a little further in the brush 
we saw two tents. Coming carefully up to them, we heard 
groans as of some one in great pain. Peeping through a hole 
in the tent, we saw two white men who, we learned on entering 
the tent, were badly wounded by knife and bullet. From 
them we learned the following facts, which were the cause 
of ;ill our fear and trouble that morning. They said the night 
before two large trains had camped there, and as these men 
were keeping the "post'' they of course had whisky to sell. 
These campers got on a drunk, quarreled, and had a general 
fight. As a result these men were badly wounded. On the 
trail, over where the Indians were, some immigrants were 
camped, and a guard was placed at the roadside. When the 
shooting and row were going on down at the "post," an Indian, 
hearing the noise, had come along the trail, when he 
was halted by the guard, and, not answering, the guard fired 
and killed him on the spot. These people immediately </seg>

hitched up and moved on. The Indians who confronted u 
coming there found the dead Indian lying in the road, wkic 
roused their anger and kept us on the ragged edge for K 
eral hours. The Indians all rode off as we began to approar 
them, and as the trail was now clear, our train moved oi 
ahead of the rest, traveling all night and keeping out all tl 
mounted men as front and rear guards. 

We now came to the "last leaving of the Little Blue" and 
passed over the opes unland, without wood or water, thirt 
three miles to Fort Kearney, in the Platte valley. Tin 
nearly nigfat and in a drizzling rain when we came to tl 
line of the reservation, where a trooper sitting on his hoi 
informed us that we would have to keep off or go on throug 
the reservation, a distance of three or four miles. It w; 
dark and raining, and we camped right there without an 
supper or fire to cook anything. We hitched up early in tl 
morning and drove into the fort, where we were very kindl 
treated by the commanding officer, whose name, I think, wi 
McArthur. lie tendered us a large room and tables, wit 
pen, ink, paper, and envelopes, where we wrote the first le 
ten back from Nebraska, which I believe were all received a 
home with much joy. The greater part of the troops wer 
absent on a scout. After buying a few things that we hac 
forgotten to bring with us, and getting rested, we moved o 
our journey again, going up on the south side of the Plat 
river. One of our comrades, Robert Nelson, belonging to tl 
captain's wagon, was now very sick with something lik 
cholera, and on May 27, about sixty miles above Fort Kea 
ney, he died. We sewed his remains up in his blanket ant 
buried him within a few rods of the river at sunrise the Bex 
day. Nearly all the company knew him well, and his deat 
and burial were to all of us very sad indeed. 

We now came to the "south fork of the Platte river," immediately 
where it flows into the main river. We had long 
dreaded this crossing, owing to the treacherous quicksands 
of itg bottom. Here the guard succeeded in killing our first </seg>

buffalo. About nine o'clock in the morning;, all things bein 
in readiness, two men were sent in to wade across the rive 
with long willows to stick in the sand to mark or« the rou 
through. Two or three wagons could be seen where they ha 
settled down in the quicksand, because of stopping in th 
stream, and were never able to get out. With these evidences 
before us of the risks we were to run, we started in. Everv 
man but the drivers walked, or rather waded, alongside th 
horses to render assistance if it should be required. Follo\ 
ing the route marked by the willows, with scarcely a wor&lt; 
spoken, we drove clear through and out on dry land withou 
a halt or break. To say that we all felt happy to know tin 
the crossing was behind us did not half express our feelings 
One man dug out a demijohn of brandy from his traps, an 
treated all hands, remarking that the "success of that unde 
taking really merited something extraordinary." 

A few days after this an incident occurred in camp tha 
bordered on the tragic, but finally ended in good feelin 
My guardmate, named Charley Stewart, and myself were th 
two youngest in the company, and being guards together w 
were great friends. He was a native of Cincinnati, well edu 
cated, and had a fund of recitations and stories that he use&lt; 
to get off when we were on guard together. This night * 
were campCd on the side of some little hills near som 
ravines. The moon was shining, but there were dark cloui 
passing over, so at times it would be quite dark. It was nea 
midnight, and we would be relieved in an hour. We had bee 
the "grand rounds" among the stock and came to the Min 
wagon, which was facing the animals, which were pickete&lt; 
out on the slope. Stewart was armed with a "Colt's navy 
and I had a double-barrelled shotgun loaded with bucksho 
I was sitting on the doubletree on the right side of th 
tongue, which was propped up with the neckyoke. Stewar 
sat on the tongue about an arm's length in front of me, 
holding my gun between my knees with the butt on th 
ground. Stewart was getting off one of his stories and wa

about to come to the climax when I saw something running 
low to the ground in among the stock. Thinking it was an 
Indian on all fours to stampede the animals, I instantly 
leveled my gun, and as I was following it to an opening in 
the herd, my gun came in contact with Stewart*! face at the 
moment of its discharge. Stewart fell backward over the 
wagon tongue, his legs and feet hanging over. My first 
thought was that I had killed him. He recovered in a moment 
and commenced cursing and calling me vile names, accusing 
me of attempting to murder him, etc. During these 
moments, in his frenzy, he was trying to get his revolver out 
from under him, swearing he would kill me in a minute. Taking 
in the situation, I dropped my gun, jumped over the wagon 
tongue, as he was now getting on his feet, and seized him 
in what proved to be a desperate fight for that revolver. We 
were both sometimes struggling on the ground; then again 
on our knees, he striking me repeatedly in the face and elsewhere, 
still accusing me of trying to murder him, and I, having 
no chance to explain things, the struggle went on. Finally 
I threw him down and held him until he was too much exhausted 
to continue the fight any longer, and having got the 
revolver from him, I helped him to his feet. In trying to 
pacify him I led him out to where the object ran that I had 
fired at, where near by lay the dead body of a* large wolf, 
with several buchshot through his hide. Stewart was speechless. 
Looking at the wolf and then at me, he quickly realized 
his mistake and repeatedly begged my pardon. We agreed 
never to mention the affair to any of the company. Taking 
the wolf by the ears, we dragged it back to the wagon, where 
I picked up my gun and gave Stewart his revolver. I have 
often thought what would have been the consequence of that 
shot had I not killed the wolf? 

Along in this vicinity the bluff comes down to the edge of 
the river, and consequently we had to take to the hills, which 
were mostly deep sand, making heavy hauling. This trail 
brought us into Ash Hollow, a few miles up from its mouth. </seg>

the Overland trail in Nebraska. 

Coming down to where it opened out on the Platte bottom, 
about noon, we turned out for lunch. Here was a party of 
Sioux Indians, camped in tents of buffalo skins. They were 
friendly, as all that tribe was that summer. This is the place 
where General Kearney, several years after, had a terrific 
fight with the same tribe, who were then on the warpath all 
along this section. 

Some weeks before the forewheel of my wagon had been 
badly damaged, and I had been on the lookout for another 
wheel for the spokes in order to make the necessary repairs. 
Taking my rifle after lunch, I started out and crossed the 
bottom, when, within a few rods of the river and about a half a 
mile off the road, which turned close along the bluff, I came 
upon an old broken down wagon almost hidden in the grass. 
Taking the measure of the spokes, I found, to my great joy, 
they were just the right size and length. Looking around I 
saw the train moving on at a good pace almost three-quarters 
of a mile away. I was delayed some time in trying to get the 
wheel off the axeltree. Succeeding at last, I fired my gun 
toward the train, but no one looked around, all evidently supposing 
that I was on ahead. It was an awfully hot afternoon, 
and I was getting warmed up myself. I reloaded my rifle, 
looked at the receding train, and I made up my mind to have 
that wheel if it took the balance of the day to get it into camp. 
I started by rolling it by hand, then by dragging it behind me ; 
then I ran my rifle through the hub and got it up on my 
shoulder, when I moved on at a good pace. The sun shining 
hot soon began to melt the tar in the hub, which began running 
down my back, both on the inside and outside of my 
clothes, as well as down along my rifle. I got out to the road 
very tired, and stopped to rest, hoping that a wagon would 
come along to help me out, but not one came in sight that 
afternoon. In short, I rolled, dragged, and carried that 
wheel, my neck, shoulders, and back daubed over with tar, 
until the train turned out to camp, when I, being missed, was 
discovered way back in the road. When relief came to me I </seg>

was nearly tired out with my exertions and want of water t 
drink. Some of the men set to work taking the broken whetapart 
and fitting the spokes, getting the wheel ready to set th 
tire. Others had collected a couple of gunnysacks full of th 
only fuel of the Platte valley, viz., "buffalo chips," and they 
soon had the job completed. The boys nearly wore themselvc 
out, laughing and jeering at me, sajing they were sorry they 
had no feathers to go with the tar, etc., calling me a variety 
of choice pet names. 

We had now passed those peculiar formations known a 
Scott's Bluff, Courthouse Rock, and Chimney Rock. Th 
latter, a few miles to the left of the road, had the outline o 
an inverted funnel, the base being quite steep to climb. From 
its center arose a column resembling a chimney, about 5 
feet square to perhaps 100 or more high. Its top sloped 01 
like the roof of a shanty, having a crack or split down from 
the top about one-quarter of its length. These formation 
were not really rock, but of a hard marl substance, the differ 
ent colored strata showing alike in them all, and could b 
easily cut with a knife. They had the appearance of havin 
been left in the washing away of the adjoining land in th

THOMAS WESTON TIPTON. 

Read by Gov. R. W. Furnas before the annual mpeting of the Nebraska State 
Historical Society, January 8, 1SKJ1. 

Thomas Weston Tipton was born August 5, 1817, near 
Cadiz, Harrison county, Ohio. His parents emigrated from 
Huntington county, Pennsylvania, to Ohio at an early day 
His father's family were originally from Maryland. Hi 
mother's maiden name was Weston. His father, William Tip 
ton, was a Methodist Episcopal preacher for fifty years, and a 

member of the Pittsburg Conference. 

The youth of the Senator was spent at home on his father's 
farm, for eighteen years, with such meager educational advantages 
as resulted from a few weeks' attendance upon 
school during the winters. His father being almost constantly 
from home, his early training was received from an 
honest, devoted, Christian mother. 

I ¦'or over two years subsequent to 1836 lie was a student at 
eglieny College, Meadville, Pa., and graduated at Madison 
liege, Pennsylvania, in the fall of 1S40, delivering the valetory 
address with groat credit and evidences of future sues. 
During the last years of his college course he became 
enthusiastic advocate of the temperance reformation and 
er abated his efforts or broke his pledge. His first vote 
s cast while a student at Madison College, for Hon. An'w 
Stewart, of Pennsylvania, a candidate for Congress, 
turning to Ohio in the fall of 1840, he occupied his time in 
ching and reading law until he was admitted to the bar In

the Ohio legislature from the county of Guernsey, as a </seg>

Whig. In 1849 he went to Washington City, and spent three 
years in the general land office, at the head of a division. 

Eeturning to Ohio he opened an office in McConnelsvillo, 
re in 1855 he made an effort to give up politics and legal 
wits and devote himself to the ministry. 

Of an enthusiastic temperament and advocating no principle 
in politics that he did not believe to be an outgrowth of 
Christian civilization, or springing directly from the imperative 
necessity of the times, he gave of his time and energies 
and means, unreservedly and recklessly, to the great political 
campaigns of 1844, '48, and '52. 

Entering the Cincinnati Conference of the Methodis 
Episcopal Church during the year of the Fremont campaign 
for the presidency, while Kansas called aloud for help, h 
found at once how utterly impossible it would be for him t 
put off totally his political armor, and was found proclaimin 
from the pulpit, "While I occupy this desk you will have 
free preacher, and all my words shall be free speech, an 
when you can not endure this you must install a slave in m 
stead, and substitute for the Bible the books of Mormon o 
Koran of Mohammed," and declaring further that he woul 
not agree to silence on moral political questions, even if demanded 
by a "father in his shroud." He further found tha 
so many years given in the freest, boldest utterances and un 
restrained action would prevent him from adopting in prac 
tice the episcopacy of the church, which he exchanged for th 
democracy of Congregationalism. 

I He came to Nebraska on invitation, in 1858, to take charge 
an educational organization at Brownville, thinking only 
quiet, civilized life. For a portion of his first time in Neaska 
he filled the pulpit in Brownville of a Union Church 
ganization. Afterward he went east, solicited financial 
I, and erected a Methodist Church in Brownville, and filled 
i pulpit for some years. 

The effort of the Buchanan pro-slavery democracy to prevent 
the organization of the Uepublican party called him </seg>

upon the stump in behalf of the right of the people to ex 
elude shivery from the territory. He was elected to a const 
tutional convention on the basis of radical republicaiiisu 
and in 1800 to a .seat in the territorial senate for two year

1 &gt; v Andrew Johnson, assessor of internal revenue for N 
braska, he had an opportunity to signalize his devotion to h 
party by refusing to adopt ''kit policy." During the sam 
year Mr. Tipton canvassed the territory in behalf of state o 
ganization, and when the constitution was adopted wa 
elected a United States senator. Entering the Fortieth Con 
M his support was cordially given to the reconstructs 
policy of his party, but in all outside questions he indulged i 
the freest latitude. On the 20th of January, 1S69, he re 
( cived a reelection for a full term of six years, and acted upo 
the same committees as those upon which he served in th 
Fortieth Congress, viz., public lands, pensions, and agricu 
ture. In the presidential campaign of 1868 he traversed 
every populous county in his state, delivering forty-nin

I lie spoke but seldom in the Senate, but snch was his sense 
propriety that he was never found upon the floor in debat

peaker, it is difficult to give him a definite place among th 
ltors of the age. He was not eloquent, and yet he claime&lt;

11. He deserved the goodwill of the citizens of this state 
a faithful servant, true to us by being true to his own 
nhood. 

Phrenologists would place Mr. Tipton among the inde 
pendent radical men of the day. His head was very high from 
the base of the brain, broad and nearly round. His eyes wer 
well set, high cheek bones, with a well-molded mouth am 
compressed lips, indicating firmness. He had a square, prom 
inent forehead, and a preponderance of intellectuality. Th 
moral group was largely developed, giving tone to his genera 
&lt; liaracter. In all matters of state, as well as individual inte 
ests, he thought for himself and acted promptly after th 
counsel of his own better judgment, independent of all per 
sonal considerations, lfight, truth, justice, and manhood 
were the chief attributes of his character. When he one 
formed an opinion he was as firm as the Rock of Gibralta 
His enemies, of whom his peculiar organism secured him 
full share, did not understand him; if they had they woul 
ever have a good word instead of enmity unworthily born 
He was, in appearance, reserved, with a tinge of moroseness 
resting upon his brow ; but touch his heart, and a well-sprin 
of social greeting flowed forth as from a I'rotean fountain 
He was a great lover of the sublime in nature, was moved wit 
sympathy for poverty and distress; was generous with h 
means, so much so that with an income of millions he woul 
die a poor man. Intellectually and morally he did not sho 
for more than a farthing of his true value. He kept his ow 
counsel, and worked by the model of an upright life. If th 
people of Nebraska knew him better they would have love&lt; 
him more, for he was as true to their best interests as th 
magnet to the pole. For this loyalty the coming generation 
will call him blessed. </seg>

ALGERNON SIDNEY PADDOCK. 

Read by W. E. Annin before the annual meeting of the Nebraska State 
Historical Society, January 8, 19J1. 

I have been asked on this occasion, pending the subsequent 
presentation of a paper upon the life and public services of 
tlif subject of this sketch, to briefly give to the Nebraska 
Historical Society a few personal reminiscences of the late 
Algernon Sidney Paddock, secretary and often acting governor 
of the Territory of Nebraska from 1861 to 1867, and 
twice a senator from this state in the upper house of Conm. 
In the few minutes allotted me to-night I desire that 
what I shall have to say shall be neither in the nature of a 
eulogy or an elegy. I should have preferred to have been 
able to present a carefully prepared, if condensed, recital of 
the prominent events in a long and honored and an honorable 
etner, together with a synopsis of his protracted and faithful 
work for the state of his adoption. Circumstances which 
I can not control have compelled me, in lieu of that pleasant 
duty, deferred for the time, to give a hasty and a somewhat undigested 
character sketch of the man whom I loved and the 
public official whom I respected and with whom I was thrown 
in contact for years on terms of close intimacy and personal 
and political association. 

I was an inmate of his home for a portion of the time, with 
him in prosperity and adversity, when the skies were glowing 
with hope and glowering with gloom. I had at times access to 
all his political and to all his private papers. I do not think 
any one was given a better opportunity to know the man and 
the public official than myself. Feeling this, I have less hesitancy 
than others might have in speaking freely of him to- </seg>

night, in the state where his entire manhood was passed, and 
among not a few, although too few, of that rapidly disappearing 
group who with him helped to lay the foundations of this 
commonwealth and assisted in erecting the superstructure. 

Senator Paddock came of old Puritan, Massachusetts 
stock. His forbears, early in the seventeenth century, located 
in the vicinity of Cape Cod. From that point, the descendants 
of Zachariah Paddock spread westward with the tide of 
New England immigration to the Connecticut valley, settled 
at Woodstock, Conn., and followed up the river northwards 
to Woodstock, Vt., where crumbling tombstones still faintly 
outline, to the curiosity of infrequently passing visitors, the 
virtues of an honest, an industrious, and a God-fearing ran 
of men and women. There his grandfather and grandmother 
lived, died, and were buried, and from thence his father and 
four uncles migrated across the boundary into New York 
state early in the last century. His father, Ira A. Paddock, 
settled at Glens Falls, New York, where he was for many 
years and until his death a prominent, useful, and most respected 
citizen. Two of his uncles, William and Joseph, 
were members of the New York legislature at a time when 
legislative prominence was an index of home regard and 
local confidence. 

I Senator Paddock was born at Glens Falls on November 9, 
30, received a high school education in his native town, and 
is prepared to enter the junior class in Union College, when 
milv reverses made it necessary for him to earn his own liv-5. 
ne taught school, studied law, and in the early spring 
1857 went to Nebraska, where his cousin, Major J. W. Padck, 
had preceded him. He took a prominent part in the 
ueral development of the Territory, was a candidate for the 
;islature in 1858, a delegate to the first territorial repuban 
convention in 1859, a delegate to the national repuban 
convention in 1860, which nominated Abraham 
ueoln, and was subsequently secretary of the Territory from 
61 to 1867, at which latter date the Territory became a state. </seg>

ALGEBXON SIDNEY PADDOCK. 

I give some personal reminiscences of the man who was a 
miineut factor in Nebraska's upbuilding, territorially, and 
er statehood had come. 

t first met Senator Paddock in 1880 during his first term 
in the Senate. I was at once attracted to him by the genuine 
ness of his personality, by an unaffected simplicity of man 
ner, by his intense faith in the State, and by his exuberan 
confidence in its future progress. My surroundings at th 
time were such that any intimacy, if it had been sought on 
either side, would have been impossible, and it was some \ • 
later before I was able to cultivate more than the pleasan 
acquaintance of a reporter with a prominent public man 
During his distinguished service on the Utah Coininissioi 
how valuable and how distinguished his surviving colleagues 
alone know, I came into closer intimacy with Mr. Paddock 
largely due to family connections, as the result of my mar 
riage to his niece. After his second election to the Senate i 
1887, when I had left newspaper work for several months 
Mr. Paddock tendered me the position of private secretary 
which I accepted in August of that year, spending three 
months with him in his home in Beatrice before leaving fo 
Washington. 

For four years while engaged in the work of a Washington 
correspondent I was private secretary for Mr. Paddock and 
clerk of the two committees of which during that time ha 
was chairman. I opened his mail and acted in the most 
confidential of capacities which a public man can afford to an 
associate or to a subordinate. I left him voluntarily two 
years before the expiration of his term as United States Sen 
ator, but our affectionate intercourse was continued until his 
death. No one better than myself was afforded opportunity 
to know of his aims, his ambitions, his hopes, his disappointments, 
his labors, and his weariness. No one better to learn 
of his generosity, his secret benevolence, his love for friends, 
his indefatigable industry, his pureness of mind, his absolute 
correctness of habits his passionate devotion to his fam- </seg>

I f his unswerving faith in his state. To me, first of all, he 
ike the news of the fatal disease which had attacked him 
il the knowledge of which with Spartan courage he kept 
im his family until its progress and its pain rendered conilmcnt 
no longer possible, and the agonizing heart throbs 
ired furrows in his kindly face and sapped the vitality of a 
ciidid constitution. What is the courage of a leader of a 
lorn hope with the excitement of battle spurring one on 
action compared to that of the man or woman in the grasp 
disease the outcome of which is not doubtful, and who 
lies the burden cheerfully, even smilingly, that others may 
t anticipate a grief which will come to them only too soon. 
ath came to him as he wished, with scarcely a pang, with 
mediate transfer from consciousness to sleep, with tender 
nls of affection on his lips, with nothing between poor 
utality and glorious immortality but a parting hand grasp, 
oving glance. 

Mr. Paddock was raised in an old-fashioned school, where 
duty was spelt with a capital initial. The old Calvinistic 
faith which he was taught in home life as a boy controlled, 
perhaps sometimes unconsciously, but always controlled consciously, 
the motives of the citizen and public servant. I 
never knew him to suggest a dishonest action. I have heard 
him say often, "That wouldn't be right or square," when sugons 
for action of which he did not approve came to him 
in his correspondence. With no pretense as an ultra religious 
man, he not infrequently talked with me about the fundamentals 
of right doing, based upon revelation, with gentle 
reverence for the teachings of his boyhood and with the 
broadest charity for others to whom arguments which appealed 
to him would have no weight. He never posed as 
what might be called "a religious politician." He had a 
thorough disgust for that character of politics which dragged 
into the canvass for the advantage of candidates the church, 
the prayer-meeting, and contributions, duly published, for foreign 
and domestic missions. But his conscience was well </seg>

trained, always acute, and was a determining force in shaping 
his character. lie had a keen sense of legislative and 
representative duty which, however it conflicted, as it some 
times did, with personal interests, generally controlled. I 
never knew him to do a mean or a dishonest thing in the years 
of my association with him. 

He was kindly, generous, and most lovable, "slow to ange 
and plenteous in mercy." Every inclination was to hel 
rather than to hinder. His temperament approached that o 
a woman in its sweetness and in its tenderness. Friendship 
to him were precious until they were found to be pinchbecl 
And even then there were self apologies for the mistakes 
which he had made in his estimation of values. In his pos 
tion as a senator he was not infrequently able to lift me 
from comparative obscurity to prominence and to perqu 
sites of official position. Sometimes they were found grat 
ful, less often responsive. But there were no heart-burnings 
in consequence on the part of Senator Paddock, no intimatio 
of political revenge, no threats of a coming retribution. 

Senator Paddock was essentially an honest man. Afte 
twelve j'ears of public service in Washington, no smell of th 
fire hung around his garments. He told me once that ever 
dollar he had made had come from Nebraska soil and the a&lt; 
vance in real estate. I verified the statement afterward from 
an examination of his private books. With many oppo 
tunities to benefit himself by speculation in connection wit 
various public positions, he died a comparatively poor mai 
largely because of a superabundant faith in Nebraska tow 
lots, interest in which he refused to relinquish at a time whe 
liquidation would have placed him in comfortable circum 
stances. When he went to Washington in 1887, at the begin 
ning of his second term as a senator, he should have been 
rick man; when he left it six years later he had lost, throug 
the depreciation of real estate in Nebraska retained in absolute 
confidence of his estimate of its value, nearly a quarter o 
a million dollars. </seg>

Inis loyalty to, and his faith in the State were prominen 
tncteriatica. There he had spent his early manhood, reived 
all his political honors, mingled with its pioneers 
tde lasting friendships, invested his first earnings, marriet 
d brought up a family. It had been his only fixed horn 
nr childhood, and it was his home always and acknow 
rad so to be until death. 

lie was an optimist, and his optimism centered around Nebnaka 
and its interests. He exploited them at home and he 
heralded thorn abroad. Nothing aroused him to resentment 
¦OW quickly than attacks upon his state or called for 
prompter and more vigorous reply, either on the floor of the 
Senate or in private conversation. He was proud of its past, 
he was satisfied with its present, and ever confident of its 
future. His very optimism was his chief weakness. It was 
his nature to always look upon the bright side of things 
politically as well as socially. He was naturally aggressive. 
He never courted antagonism. He invariably preferred 
friendships to enmities, and never knew the delight of being 
a i_ r &lt;&gt;"d and persistent hater. And yet he was an excellent 
Ighter in a political conflict, not with bludgeon and halbert, 
but with simitar and finesse. Disliking a field of carnage, 
lie was not averse, if pressed by circumstances, to entering 
the fray and giving an excellent account of himself as a participant 
in the tourney. But the battle over, victorious or 
defeated, he cherished no enmities toward vanquished or 
victors. His kindliness of disposition and cheeriness of temjh 
rainent prevented personal exultation or personal 

Senator Paddock was in the best sense of the term a domestic 
man. The glare and glitter of official life in Washington 
had no attractions for him. He was most miserable 
when attending some function where he was a distinguished 
guest, and never so happy as when able to give an honest 
excuse for an honest absence. Midnight life had no charms 
for him. He was most contented when in his modest library </seg>

I 'king over reports or delving into files of dreary docuits 
bearing upon cases before his various committees. He 
i not a diner-out, a hon vivant, or an after-dinner speaker, 
did not pose as an epigrammatic subject of perpetual inriews 
in the daily press, attracting notoriety by grotesques 
of manner or speech or calling attention to himself l&gt;y 
)syncrasies of behavior in official or social circles. Sen 
r Paddock was simply a well born and a well bred gentlen 
with a modesty of deportment which bespoke his birth 
I training and a courtesy and polish of demeanor which 
wore easily because natural to himself. 

I Mr. Paddock was not an orator. He made no pretenses to 
rensic ability. He shunned rather than courted the stump, 
•oin a sense of duty he bore his share of campaigning, but 
ver enjoyed the platform, and neither sought nor expected 
sry from the hustings. But he thought clearly and he 
¦ote well upon subjects which interested him. He was 
cile with his pen and felicitous in his use of language. He 
rely spoke extemporaneously in the Senate, but his carelly 
prepared speeches on topics economic and political 
;re above the average of his colleagues. At least, he never 
varied the Senate. When he spoke it was because he had 
mething to say, because he felt that be was called upon to 
y it in his representative capacity, and because he honestly 
It that it would be better said than left unsaid. 

His unwearying industry was the predominant characteristic 
of Mr. Paddock as a public man. No senator ever worked 
more untiringly for a constituency. There was no detail of 
correspondence too small, no appeal for investigation and 
help too insignificant, no cause for a Nebraskan too petty to 
at t ract his immediate attention and his personal and unswerving 
interest. What other senators left for clerks and 
messengers to investigate and report upon, Senator Paddock 
attended to in person. He made himself an always willing 
messenger for the humblest as well as the most influential of 
his constituents with an energy that was as tireless as it was

Ireistent. As a western senator (whose people were conned 
with the pressing questions of the disposal of the publands, 
of irrigation, of Indian affairs, of pensions, of the 
)blems of agriculture and of cattle raising, with the thould 
and one suggestions which came from a new and a west-1 
state believed to have an application to national legislan, 
or to be in touch with national legislation) Senator 
(ldock was sympathetic, considerate, and unselfish. He 
rer lacked in confidence in his own ability to do the beat 
it could be done, but he never permitted ability to wait for 
lvenient opportunity. He worked as regularly and as 
•efully, day by day, in the departments as he did with his 
•respondence at his desk in his committee room, and was 
careful to conscientiously attend to both as he was to ocpy 
during the session his seat on the floor of the Senate. 

I As a citizen of Nebraska and at home, Mr. Paddock was 
Rays hopeful, public spirited, and energetic. He was 
)sely identified with the interests of Omaha and Beatrice 
iring his successive residences in these cities, and attained 
well earned prominence due to his readiness to stake hia 
sans upon the progress and development of the commuties 
of which he was a member. He believed in Nebraska 
id he thought that Nebraska ought to believe in him. lie 
It that the State had reason to trust him as he always 
listed the commonwealth which had honored him and which 
had faithfully served. Others might decry it, — not he. In 
nes of sternest stress his faith never faltered. Even then 
had a kindly word for political adversaries and a half 
ology in the presence of a third party for what he believed 
be their really injurious and unjustifiable attitude on pub¦ 
questions affecting the State. 

I Mr. Paddock was keenly sensitive to criticism and suffered 
eatly and patiently at times from the abuse of a school of 
urnalism which it is to be hoped is dying out in the State, 
d in which dislike was considered sufficient justification 
r atrocious attack, and envy ample warrant for ministering </seg>

malevolence. Both his successful senatorial campaigns were 
won after bitter contests over able rivals and with a divided 
press, as was not unnatural. Political conditions were never 
such that his election was handed to him on a silver platter 
while the dogs of partisan war were held in the leash. He 
fought for what he attained and he earned what he got. Amid 
aluise, misrepresentation, threats, he quietly plotted his way 
towards the goal. He won two victories in senatorial campaigns; 
he suffered two defeats. He was no more elated by 
thi' former than he was depressed by the latter, nurt not infrequently 
by the defection of alleged friends, his generous 
¦Ml could not harbor resentments. If he did not pray for 
those who dospitefully used him, he often declined to permit 
them to be despitefully used and preyed upon by others. And 
he received little credit for an attitude which some claimed 
snored of compromise or weakness, but which those who 
knew him best knew was the outcome of a kindly and a forgiving 
nature more considerate of the feelings of rivals often 
than they were of his own. 

The public services of Senator Paddock to territory and

efforts were always along practical lines. Where possible, he 
MMgat the lines of least resistance, but he did not shrink 
from opposition. He assisted in placing upon the statute 
books a Large number of the laws which have proved of greatest 
permanent benefit to the West. The development of the 
agricultural department from a government bureau to a cabinet 
office was due in large degree to his efforts. The cattle

In obtaining useful special legislation for his state he

tlie Fifty-first Congress, lie resented what he thought to be unwise 
party leadership. lie believed that the reconstruction 
policy which President Johnson was tactlessly trying to force 
through, was — however blundering the method of its emphasi 
— the policy which Abraham Lincoln'uad outlined and 
would have adopted. He had the courage of his convictions 
in this raped and put them to the test. History will approve 
his judgment. In the Fifty-first Congress he struggled 
hard to secure additional concessions on the line of reductions 
iu tariff imports which peculiarly affected the West, 
and was one of fourteen western senators to pledge himself 
to defeat the conference report and throw the bill back into 
¦¦other conference through which the required concession 
could be secured, if their demands should not be com

against a republican tariff bill but against a bill as formulated, 
which he felt was not entirely just to his state and 
ion, and which he desired further improved before it was 
brought to a final vote. The defeat of the conference report 
would have compelled, of course, a further conference and an 
ultimate yielding on the part of the House conferees to at 
least a portion of the Senate demands. It was for this that 
Senator Paddock courageously fought even when deserted by

Elged themselves to maintain to the end the position from 
ch he himself refused to be diverted. It was the act of a 
ve and an honest man, an act which Mr. Paddock neve 
retted or wished to recall. 

As a rule, however, Senator Paddock was a strong party 
man and a strong partisan. He believed that public men 
could best subserve the public interests through party organizations, 
and that the expression of party opinion through 
regularly constituted party channels was binding upon those 
who professed to follow its banner. He loved the party with 
which lie affiliated. He was proud of its traditions and of 
his connection with it from its birth, of his acquaintance with 
its founders, of his association with its great minds distinguished 
in its highest councils. His loyalty was to party 
ideals as he perceived them, and he always regretted differences 
between himself and friends upon questions of party 
policy and party conduct, whether state or national. But he 
had the courage of his political convictions and yielded due 
deference to those of others who differed from himself. He 
recognized the necessity of rivalries and ambitions and the 
struggle to enforce divergent views upon the electorate. He 
knew the bitter as well as the sweets of prominence, the selfishness 
of place hunting, the ingratitude of satisfied endeavor, 
the disappointment of the laurel gained, the shallowness of 
political professions, the secession of friends, the success of 

All these — yes — for he played no insignificant part in the 
political drama of territory and state and nation during the 
closing half of the last century when history was made an 1 
unmade, and the great empire of the West sprang into being 
largely as the result of political rivalries. 

Eut there can be no rivalry with the dead. Perhaps they

TIIE FARMERS' ALLIANCE IN NEBRASKA. 

SOMETHING OF ITS ORIGIN, GROWTH, AND INFLUENCE. 

rby J. M. Thompson, Secretary Nebraska Farmers' Alliance 1839-93, 
before the Nebraska State Historical Society, January 8, 1901. 

I The Farmers' Alliance in the United States was first ornizod 
during the year 1879. Milton George, of Chicago, 
ijaniml the first Alliance in Illinois, near the city of Chigo 
in that year, and through the instrumentality of his 
per, the Western Rural, the principles of the society spread 
throughout the Northwest, and many Alliances were organ- 
F after his plan. About the same time a similar organizaappeared 
in Texas, which afterwards became the basis 
the Southern Alliance. 

I The first aim of the society throughout the Northwest was 
unite the farmers for the purpose of discussing and advoting 
certain principles of industrial and political reform, 
ith this was combined in many instances attempts at 
iteration in business. 

II ts growth was quite rapid, and societies were soon organ•d 
in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, and Nebraska. 
Illinois, the Patrons of Husbandry covered a similar field, 
d fewer local organizations of the Alliance were made 
that state. 

Ehe first alliance organized in Nebraska was formed near 
ey, in Gage county, in the year 1880, and about the same 
i a subordinate Alliance was formed at Alda, in Hall 

Ehe first state Alliance of Nebraska was organized at Lini,

Kinty, was the first president of the society, and Hon. J. 
rrowa, of Gage county, its first secretary. 

As at first organized the society had no regular constitution, 
but merely a declaration of principles, which were to be 
the object of its effort. It consisted first of subordinate Alliances, 
which were neighborhood societies, and which held 
frequent meetings for the discussion and study of ¦abject* 
and principles of interest to the farmers. These local Alliances 
were each entitled to a delegate to the annual state 
meeting, which was held once a year. 

t[n the year 1887 the State Alliance of Nebraska met at 
ncoln and organized as a secret society, adopted a condition 
and by-laws, ritual and secret work, and formued 
the following declaration of principles: 

DECLARATION OF PURPOSES. 

{Profoundly impressed that we, the Farmers' Alliance. 
lited l&gt;y the strong and faithful ties of financial and home 
lerests, should set forth our declaration of intentions, we 
erefore resolve : 

To strive to secure the establishment of right and justice 
to ourselves and our posterity. 

ITo labor for the education of the agricultural classes in 
• science of economical government in a strictly non-partiti 
spirit. 

To secure purity of the elective franchise, and to induce all 
voters to intelligent lv exercise it for the enactment and execution 
of laws which will express the most advanced public 
sentiment upon all questions involving the interests of 
laborers and farmers. 

ITo indorse the motto, "In things essential, unity; in all 
ings, charity." 

ITo develop a better state, mentally, morally, socially, and 
lancially. 

ITo constantly strive to secure harmony and good will^ 
long all mankind, and brotherly love among ourselves. 

To suppress personal, local, sectional, and national prejudices, 
all unhealthful rivalry, and all selfish ambition. 

To assuage the sufferings of brother and sister, bury the </seg>

dead, care for the widows, and educate the orphans; to exercise 
charity to all offenders; to construe words and {MUTf 
in their most favorable light, granting honesty of purpose 
and good intentions to others, and to protect the principles 
of the Alliance unto death. 

E)uring the year 1888 considerable activity was shown 
jng all industrial organizations throughout the country 
at the annual meeting of the Nebraska Farmers' Alliauc 
1 in January, 1889, only fourteen counties were repre 
ted by about one hundred delegates. 

Et this meeting plans for more thorough work were made, 
the state officers were authorised to take the field if 
'ssavy, and personally organize in counties where no Alee 
already existed. 

I In accordance with these plans, lion. J. H. Powers, the 
wly elected state president, ably assisted by Mr. Burrows, 
en chairman of the state executive committee, and J. M. 
mmpson, state secretary-treasurer, began to push the work 
organization throughout the State. 

I During this year over five hundred local Alliances were 
altered. State headquarters were established at Lincoln 
.May, 1889. 

I The first issue of the Farmers' Alliance, a paper devoted to 
e society's interests and advocating its cause, appeared 
me 12, 18S9, which was in September put under the control 
the chairman of the executive committee and state secrery, 
and issued from the head office. 

I The annual meeting at Grand Island, in January of 1890, 
is the largest and most enthusiastic meeting of an indunial 
organization Nebraska had ever seen, and its influence 
is felt throughout the State. 

In the year 1890, over twelve hundred local Alliances were 
formed, and by July 1 of that year at least fifteen hundred 
local alliances were in existence, reaching into every important 
county in the State, with a membership of over fifty </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

I'hese Alliances held frequent meetings at school houses 
in the homes of the members. Regular courses of study 
e adopted by many of them, taking up the questions that 
e agitating the minds of the people and discussing them 
in earnest manner, looking to their careful solution. In 
er to "secure purity of the elective franchise" the Ausian 
Ballot Law was studied with a view to recommendits 
adoption by the State; reforms in existing laws, espely 
those relating to insurance, public schools, and other 
jects of interest to the members of the State generally 
« considered, and each organization became to some ext 
a school where the members were forming new ideas of 
ir duties as citizens and new conceptions of their privies 
as sovereign voters. 

Irhe great drouth throughout western Nebraska in the 
inner of 1890 was particularly severe on the farmers, and 
ore any measures for relief were taken by the State, the 
riners' Alliance was soliciting aid through the society in 
er states, supplemented by all the available cash in its 
asury at home. Three thousand dollars out of the treas¦ 
was divided among the western counties, while the 
iance in eastern counties contributed nearly as much more 
cash, besides large quantities of grain and provisions 
ough the fund started by the state paper and officers of the 
ite Alliance. 

When the State legislature in the winter of 1891 made au 
appropriation to enable the farmers to sow their fields and 
exist until a crop could be secured, the Alliance Relief Committee 
was in many counties recognized as the best means of 
distributing this aid. 

§Iuch has been said during the past ten years concerning 
Alliance in Nebraska politics, yet a descriptive paper on 
society would not be complete without something on this 
ject.

Iie in the three days' session. Various and conflicting view 
re presented and discussed, but as the members affiliate* 
h the different political parties in the State, independen 
itical action was not deemed advisable. A spirit of pocal 
unrest, however, was felt throughout the State, and in 
y a meeting of the state officers and representatives from 
h county was called at Lincoln to further consider tin 
tter. About one hundred earnest men attended this meet 
;, and every phase of the existing political situation wa 
en up and thoroughly discussed. 

I^he officers of the State Alliance believed that more eftive 
work could be done by continuing the educational 
tures of the organization, which would in a great measure 
stopped by the formation of a new political party. The 
uand for independent political action, especially from the 
stern counties, was not to be overcome, and it was finally 
•eed that petitions calling for a Peoples' Independent Conition 
should be circulated throughout the State, and, 
•uld the response warrant it, the call for a convention 
uld be issued. 

I The State Grange and Knights of Labor were also invited 
cooperate in the movement, and many of their members 
ve it their hearty support. 

The following call was prepared and sent to local Alliances 
throughout the State :

AND POPULAR CALL FOR A PEOPLES' INDEPENDENT STATE 
CONVENTION. 

{We, the undersigned, citizens of the State of Nebraska, 
rebv declare our adhesion to the following fundamental 
inciples, and demand that they be enacted into law, viz. : 

Our financial system should be reformed by the restoration 
of silver to its old time place in our currency and its free 
and unlimited coinage on an equality with gold, and by the 
increase of our money circulation until it reaches the sum of </seg>

$50 per capita; and all paper issues necessary to secure that 
amount should be made by the government alone, and be full 
legal tender for all debts, public and private. 

The land monopoly should be abolished either by limitation 
of ownership or graduated taxation of excessive holdings, so 
that all the competent should have an opportunity to tabor, 
secure homes, and become good citizens; and alien ownership 
should be prohibited. 

(That the railroad system as at present managed is a system

should own and operate the railroads and telegraph, 
d furnish transportation at cost, the same as mail facili- 
S are now furnished ; and that our legislature should enact

We further declare that the political machinery in this 
state has been controlled by the corporate power for the 
plunder of the people and the enrichment of itself, and we 
have entirely lost confidence in the efficiency of that machinery 
for the enactment of just and the repeal of unjust laws. 

We therefore hereby give our voice for the call of the 
Peoples' Independent State Convention, to nominate pure 
and honorable men for the different state oflices on the principles 
named above; and we hereby pledge ourselves, if pure 
and honorable men are so selected, to vote and work for their 

And we hereby invite all men, without regard to past or 
present political affiliations, to join us in this, our effort for 
pure government, for the relief from the shackles of party 
politics and the domination of corporate power in our public 
affairs. 

And we hereby request the secretary of the State Farmers'

|[n less than thirty days over fifteen thousand voters km 
ned the petition, and on June 28 the call for I People*' Ii 
wndent State Convention was issued to meet on July t 
Lincoln, for the nomination of a state ticket. In this con 
ition seventy-nine counties were represented by 873 del 
:es, and a full state ticket was nominated upon a platforn 
¦dging certain reforms in state gorenuMat, and in con 
mity with the text of the petition already qaoted. 

iThe results of this campaign are familiar to every citizen 
the State and form an important epoch in its history. The 
irmers' Alliance, in the election of the majority of the state 
,'islators, assisted in shaping the course of legislation in the 
*sions of 1891 and 1893. 

E5ome of its organizers and officers became trusted servants 
the people of the state as legislators, and later as state of»rs, 
and with few exceptions proved worthy of the trust 
"ised in them. 

tThe growth of the Farmers' Alliance in 1S91 was checked 
tuewhat by the political situation of that year, but its inlence 
was felt in many ways. 

I Mutual insurance societies had been organized in a num 
r of counties under amended laws, nearly all of which con 
me to do a successful business. Other cooperative ente 
ises were formed, many of which have been made th 
icleu8 for establishing profitable creameries, elevators 
•. Many of its younger members under the stimulus of it 
ucational work felt the need of a higher education, am 
imbers of them turned toward the State University an 
her colleges. 

Since 1893 the organization has been active only in a few 
localities, and although holding its annual meeting each 
year very few of its members expect it to recover its former 
greatness. </seg>

KEMINISCENCES. 

Read by ex-Mayor H. W. Hardy before the Annual Meeting of State Historical 

Society, January 8, 1901. 

The territory from which Nebraska was carved was first 
brought to our mind by the study of Olney's geography, early 
in the thirties. We remember the Great American Desert, 
which extended from the Lakes to the Kocky mountains and 
from the North Pole to the Gulf. We remember the scenes 
pictured there. One represented Indians driving buffaloes 
over ¦ hijrh bank into a corral made of poles. We remember 
"another picture, that of a prairie fire, where Indians, buffalo, 
and wolves were running for their lives before the flames. 

{The next we remember of seeing several bales of buffalo 
ins lying upon the sidewalk in the city of Buffalo, just 
might from the Missouri river near Council Bluffs. This 
is early in the forties. 

IThe next we remember was a letter from an older brother, 
•itten after his arrival in California in 1849. He went the 
erland route, and described the country west of Rock Isld. 
He found no signs of white men except on the Des 
sines river, two priests and two ferrymen at Council Bluffs, 
•ompany of soldiers at Kearney, and Mormons at Salt Lake, 
est of the Missouri he found buffalo paths running to the 
atte river, and Mormon paths running west.

The next was (inrlcv's description of his stage ride to the

at the expense of running a state would be too great. In

President Johnson vetoed it. In January, 1867, Congress 
passed another bill, then repassed it over the President's sec 
oud veto. In 1871 a state constitutional convention wa 
called and a new constitution framed, which was rejected 1&gt; 
tin* people The chief objection raised was against the tax 
lag of meeting-houses. It was argued that grave-yards am 
school-houses should be taxed just as much as meeting-hoii 
so that the community that got along without these luxurie 
should lie relieved of that much tax. 

I in 1875 another convention was called, and the presei 
istitution was adopted by a vote of 30,202 against 5,474 
feral amendments to the present constitution have bee 
miitted to a vote of the people, but the method of votin

tnted in. The three most noted amendments that ha\ 
¦n submitted were those extending the right of suffrage t 
men, the prohibition of the liquor traffic, and the incr 
the number of supreme judges. 

We first landed in Lincoln in October, 1S70, and one of th 
first things that attracted our attention was a political mee 
ing held in the new state house, then nearly completed. (!o\ 
ei nor David Butler was the speaker. He was a candidat 
for reelection. lie openly acknowledged that he had loane. 
state money to himself, that he had also loaned to Mr. Ticl

though the money was never paid back. He was elected b 
an increased majority; but the legislature that was electee

legislature a few years ago impeached the impeachers b

ler to full citizenship. The money he loaned has all been 
paid back with interest. 

i\t the time of our first landing in Lincoln we found bu 
1 small school house; it was built of brown stone, and stun 
the east side of Eleventh street, between (J and R. It wa 
erwards used as a city jail. The city jail before that con 
ted of a dugout standing near the center of the block wei 
the post-oflice. 

Irhe University was not opened till the fall of 1871. W 
st confess that the first line of professors did not at tl 
it favorably impress us. But it was the University tin 
liicted us here, jind we have always stood up for it. It 
v one of our greatest and most hearty joys to visit tl 
iveisity shops and farm. The ball games have no chari 
us. Practical education is what our boys and girls nee 
re than style and show. 

Cars had coiiiinenced to run from Plattsmouth to Lincoln, 
and the only depot was an old freight car. 

The buffaloes h;td all been driven west of the Blue river. 
Inn deep worn paths leading to the creek were found every 
half mile. Wolves, deer, and antelope were often seen. 

The penitentiary then consisted of a small brown stone 
building, with a board fence around it. A few years later a 
rebellion of the prisoners caused quite an excitement, but a 
company of soldiers from Fort Omaha quelled the rebellion 
without bloodshed or loss of prisoners. 

The burning of the insane asylum, which was about to 
tumble down, was another scene of public interest. There is 
no doubt that the insurance money was the cause of the 
burning. The fire occurred early in the spring of 1871. 

I During the summer of 1877 the foundation walls of the 
st University building, built of rotten brown stone, began 
crumble, and the building was condemned as unsafe. Your

Next to our University and public schools stand our publi

deeply interested is the establishment of the Lincoln cit\

signed our first warrant, giving $300 as a starter. Since then 
the Mecca and future prospects of the institution are wcl

a year ago lias been healed by a gift of Andrew Carnegie o

by contractor Joseph Ward, who had the contract of building 
the first state capitol. There were also twelve other 
stone-cutters who came west to Lincoln. Neb., along with me. 
We wore to receive $4.o(l per day as soon as we began work, 
lie paid our way as far as Omaha, and then transferred us 
back to Council Bluffs, from which place we arrived in Neliraska 
City. Here we rested for a day and night. There 
were two teams hired to bring our tool-chests and trunks from 
the depot on the Iowa side across by ferry to Nebraska City. 
We had guns and revolvers to protect ourselves from the 
Indians. Before we left Nebraska City we were advised to 
gH hlankets and moccasins, as it looked as if there was a 
•torn roiling Sure enough the ¦torn did eome, after we left 
Nebraska City for Lincoln. We had to walk and run all the 
way behind the wagons to keep ourselves from freezing the 
fust day. I believe the moccasins we bought saved our lives 
on the road. The first day we came as far as a place where 
there was one shanty on each side of a creek. One was occupied 
by a man by the name of Wallen and the other by a 
man by the name of Luff, old pioneers on the Nemaha near 
Cnadilla. The owners of the houses were scared at us until 
we told them where we were going to; that we were going 
to Lincoln to build the state capitol. Then they divided us 
between the two houses. One house kept seven men and the 
other five. Lucky enough they had some bread, coffee, anJ 
bacon. They did the very best they possibly could for us. 
Bat such sleeping apart ments! A loft in the peak of each 
shanty, with loose boards for a floor, on which we slept. And 
such a night! We lay on the floor with our lucky blankets 
rolled around us and kept ourselves as warm as we could. </seg>

Next morning we got a breakfast of the same kind of food, 
paid our bill, and thanked the pioneer gentlemen for their 
kind treatment. Then we started for Lincoln and arrived at 
the Pioneer Hotel at 9:00 i-.m. that night. This hotel was 
owned liv Mr. Bcroggina, and was north of where the State 
Journal building is at present, on Ninth street. The numlter 
at the hotel that night after we signed our names on the 
rter was sixty-live. The Lotel was well filled with lodg¦ 
•(insisting of laborer!, mechanics, doctors, and a few lawvci-jj. 
The next morning we went to see where our job was 
to be. A few men went with us and showed us the place. To 
our great surprise there was nothing for us to sec but the 
trenches dug for tlie foundation. There was no material in 
the way of stone for us to go to work at. So we were badlv 
discouraged. What could we do, out in the wilderness of 
Nebraska, and our families in Chicago? At this time the 
Contractor was on his way from Chicago to Lincoln, three 
days behind us. We patiently waited for him to come, and 
when he did come we met him determined to do something 
desperate. In fact we were going to hang him. When he 
saw the material was not on hand for us to go to work at, he 
there and then told us not to he uneasy; that he would see 
that we would get our wages, work or play, according to 
agreement, as the State was good for it. So that pacified us. 
We were idle two weeks before the rock came in. He paid us 
full time. We then built a sod boarding house ou the eapitol 
grounds and boarded all the men working on the building. A 
man and team were hired to haul all the things required for 
the table from Nebraska City. That was good board at $5, 
so we were all well satisfied up to the 1st of April, 1S(J8. At 
that time a man by the name of Felix Carr came from Omaha 
with a letter from Governor Butler to the contractor, Mr. 
Ward. This man made a deal with Mr. Ward, who rente 1 
the boarding house to Mr. Carr. Then Mr. Carr went back 
to Omaha and brought out his wife and family to run the 
boarding house. lie also brought out two big barrels of </seg>

whisky. Then we saw what was up. We held a meeting an; 
resolved to boycott the whisky, as the boys were all savin 
their money at this time. A few days after he invited som 
of the men to have a drink, but they refused, and he wa 
gnttlj surprised to see such a large number of men iu a bi 
building like a state capitol all sober. Hut one wet day came 
and some of the unisons broke the boycott about a month afte 
the whisky cue. This continued for a week. 1 watched a 
opportunity at Right when they were all asleep, and crept t 
where the barrel was and turned the faucet in the barrel, 
then crept back to bed again. The whisky kept running a 
night on the floor and down the cracks, until the barrel wa 
empty. In the morning the smell of whisky was all over th 
boarding house. The man Carr became tearing mad. lie ca 
ricd a brace of revolvers at the breakfast table and threatene? 
the man or men who committed the crime of emptying th 
band of its contents. But he did not shoot. A few days aftt 
all the stonecutters left the boarding-house and went to M 
Lane's new boarding house on O street. He was forema 
carpenter. 

.Mr. Felix Carr left in a few weeks and never paid Mr. 
Ward, the contractor, a cent of rent, and took his blankets, 
dishes, even the stove, spoons, and knives, and never was 
seen in Lincoln since. 

In the spring of 18G8 the prairie was covered with camp 
wagons, consisting of bull teams, mule teams, and horse 
teams, all seeking out section stones and taking up honiesnads 
and preemptions in Lancaster county. The land oftee 
was in Nebraska City at this time. All available teams 
were employed hauling lumber from Nebraska City and stone 
from Beatrice for the state capitol. Frame houses were 
springing up in all directions. Carpenters, masons, and 
plasterers were in demand. Auction sales were conducted by 
Thomas Hyde, auctioneer, selling city lots at that time to 
pay the expenses of building the capitol. The kind of money 
in circulation at that time was called greenbacks, and it was 
easy carried in a man's pocket, not being so heavy as gold. </seg>

THE FIRST STATE CAPITOL. 

In the fall of the same year, 1868, politics were getting 
lively. There were two liberty poles planted on top of a hill 
called market square at that time, north of where the postoffice 
is now built, between O and P streets. One was a Democrat 
pole and the other was a Republican pole, both with the 
stars and stripes flying from the top. The Kepublieau pole w;is 
taller than the other, being spliced. But some wicked villain 
came around one night, threw a rope across the top of it, and 
kept pulling at it until it fell across the top of the hill and 
i racked in two pieces. In the morning when the men were 
going to work, they only saw one pole with the stars and 
stripes flying, and that was the Democrat pole. When the 
report went around the town the people gathered in swarms 
to see the broken liberty pole. There was nothing but weeping 
and wailing and gnashing of teeth among the old veterans 
of the late war. Finally there was a colored barber of the 
name of Johnston who lived west of the hill on Ninth street 
where Humphrey's hardware store is now. lie reported 
that he heard the crack of the pole when it fell, and that he 
saw a man running toward the livery barn of Dunbar am 
Jones, on west O street. Suspicion fell on young Jones because 
he was a southern Democrat, and he was taken and a 
guard placed over him. The Moore brothers and other vet 
erans of the recent war went to George Ballentine's lumber 
yard and got lumber and built a scaffold on top of the hill 
where the pole lay. The scaffold was built to hang Jones on, 
and his trial was to be held that evening before Judge Cadman. 
The Democrats got very uneasy, and sent word out 
toward Salt creek and other places around Lincoln to he in 
at the hanging. There did a lot of them come in and waited 
until the trial commenced. Judge Cadman called the c 
and the witness appeared. He said he heard a loud noise of 
something cracking, and he looked out and saw a man running 
toward the barn after the crack. 

"Did you know the man?" 

Answer — "&gt; T o, sir." </seg>

"Any more witnec 

There were none. 

''I discharge the prisoner for want of further prosecution." 

So there was no banging on that scaffold in 1868. 

In 1868 Mr. Robert (Silvers got the contract of building th 
State University. The first thing he did was to start a brieyard. 
He bought all the wood he eould find in the countr 
and had to haul it with teams, as there was no railroad in th 
country at that time, lie hauled the foundation stone froi 
Yankee IliH, which was sand rock. This was of little ac 
count. As there was no other stone around Lincoln at tha 
time to build any kind of foundation with, even the first ban 
at the corner of Tenth and O was built out of it. At that tim 
Mr. Silvers did not know how he could find stone for the step 
at the three principal entrances, south, east, and west, to th 
University. He asked me if there was any show to get thei 
at any price. He told me to search the country to see if 
could find any, as he hated to put wooden steps in a Stat 
University. I started out on a puny, and the first day I couh 
find no stone that would suit. The second I went east am 
found stone located south of Bennet in a ravine, I was ove 
joyed to find a lot of line sound stone that had been expose* 
to the sun for years. I knew that on that account they wer 
sound. I then returned and told Mr. Silvers that I hat 
found the stones that would make the steps. He asked in 
would they split with the frost. I said to him that if eve 
one of them split with the frost never to pay me one cent fo 
my material or labor. ''Well," he said, "name your price 
"Oli," I said, "about Sl.. r &gt;0 a superficial foot." He then sai 
t'i me, "The job is yours." The contract was then made ou 

I got all the stones that had been long exposed to the frost 
and sun, dressed them, and they are there to day, after all the 
wear and tear they have received since they were laid in 18GS. 
The Steps and landings at the three entrances cost $1,000, 
and Mr. Silvers made me a present of $50 and thanks. </seg>

EAKLY niSTOIIY OF JEFFEKSON COUNTY 

OVEIJLAND KOUTE. 

Prepared by W. W. Watson for the State Historical Society, January 8, 1900. 

I The earliest record of overland travel through Jefferson 
unty is that made by Fremont in ISti', and it is evident 
&gt;m his written report that he followed almost exactly the 
ute afterward traveled by the Ben Holladav stage line and 
e overland freighters, lie writes of finding camping places 
lere the early emigrants to Oregon had stopped, and apars 
to have followed along the line they had traveled. His 
nip at Bock creek was evidently where the stage station was 
terward located, and from his description of the locality 
must have crossed Big Sandy creek at or near where D. C. 
¦nkins built his ranch in 1858. 

The wagon road afterward traveled by the Californians of 
9, and the freighting outfits later from Ft Leavenworth, 
ntered the county near the southeast corner, a few miles 
orth of the Hollenherg ranch, in Kansas, and about four 
iles northeast of the present location of Steele City. It 
ntersected the Ilolladay stage route which followed up the 
ig Blue valley from Marysville to Oketo, and then turned 
est along the divide south of Indian creek and very near the 
&gt;resent line of the B. &amp; M. K. IJ., intersecting the overland 
ail at Cadwell's ranch. 

A few miles west was the Rock creek stage station, and on 
the west bank of the creek was located the MeCandless ranch, 
and afterward, in 1866, D. C. Jenkins built at this point his 
second ranch and a toll bridge, for which he secured a charter 
from the territorial legislature of lS(&gt;4-Gr». The tradi- </seg>

charter for his bridge across Rock "river" than he had in 
preventing the freighters from shoveling a roadway down 
the bank and going around the bridge, thus avoiding the pay 
ment of toll. The stage station was at one time in charge o 
George Ilulburt, afterward of Kearney, Neb., and in 186 
was kept by II. Wells. William Hiscock, better known a 
"Wild Bill," was in charge of the stock at that dale, whe 
lfcCandtew, who had built a ranch on the west bank of th 
creek, undertook to take possession of the station he ha 
formerly owned and claimed he had not been paid for by th 
¦tagc company. In the melee which followed his attemp

From this point the road traversed Rock Creek precinct in 
northwesterly direction, and at one time the stage compan 
kept a station in charge of Ray Grayson at the west line » 
the precinct, about three miles northeast of where Fairbur 
is now located. This station was called "Whisky Kun" sta 
tion, but the name was afterward bestowed on a small ranc 
near the head of "Whisky Run" creek. The name is sai&lt; 
to have been derived from the seizure by a party of soldier 
and the pouring out upon the prairie of several barrels o 
whisky, found in the possession of some freighters, whic 
they were vending along their route. Virginia Station o 
Lone Tree was located on section 2G, in Kichland precinct 
on the land now owned by Robinson Bros. It was first kej 
by S. Grayson, an employee of the stage company, and aftei 
ward by W. P« Hess. A short distance west a man name 
Miato Jones had a small trading post in 18G0, but the In

ut half a mile north of the Big Sandy ranch, and th 
ilry between the ranch keepers to secure the travel a 
r respective crossings was such that at times arinci 
rds were needed to prevent the digging of ditches across 
road so that travel might be diverted from one road t 
other. A short distance west George Weisel, now of A

Brownville, and the route they traveled via Tecumseh and 
atrice passed through the north part of Jefferson county

ated on the bank of Big Sandy about one mile from where it 
empties into Little Blue. Mr. Slaughter owed a ranch about 
one half mile north of ours, ami Mr. Weisel a ranch about 
two miles west of us. There were also Kiowa, Little Blue, 
and many other ranches still further west. These ranches 
were all on the Ben Ilolladay overland stage route from the 
Missouri river west to the IJockies. Mr. Wolff and I kept 
the stage station, and the mail was delivered at our ranch to

tDKAU Sir — I will try to answer your questions in regard 
the stage drivers and freighters to the best of niv memory. 
¦ginning at the west, the first ranch in the county was 1 Yr 
I's ranch, situated west of the r rowing of the Big Sandy, 
was kept by Ed Ferrell. The next station to the east was 
rginia station, situated at the Lone Tree, on the Ed Uob- 
KM place. It was kept at first by S. Grayson. Then came 
H.k creek, or Mc( 'and less' ranch. I don't remember who 
pt it first; afterward George Ilulbert kept it. 

I Some of the old stage drivers were Raj (irayson, Fran 
iker, John Gilbert, Pete Ilanna, George Ilulbert, and Cai 
d Charles Emery. Frank Baker lives at De Witt; Joh 
lbert at Bed Cloud; Carl Emery was killed at Beatrice 
d I don't know what became of the others. Frank Bakt 
is presented a suit of clothes by the manager, Ben Holla 
y, for giving him the fastest ride over the route. 

Some of the stock tenders were "Wild Bill" or Win. EFisrock, 
Keene Craven, and John Gilbert "Wild Bill" afterward 
became notorious, first as the slayer of McCandless 
and afterward as a scout and desperado. 

The 'Tony Express" riders of my recollection were Jim 
Beetle, who was killed in a quarrel, and Bob Martin, who 
afterward was hung for complicity in a stage robbery in the 
Black Hills. 

Among the freighters were Fargo &amp; Co., Majors &amp; Kussfli, 
Wells, James Ferrell, and Furbush, Wardle &amp; Co., the Helvey 
Bros., and many others whom I can not recall at this 
time.

by a large party of Sioux and all the white men of the

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

BULL-WHACKING DAYS. 

r following article was prepared by Mr. George P. Marvin, editor of the 
Beatrice Democrat, and published in that journal for use at the old 
Freighters' Meeting of the Nebraska State Historical fcociety, January 
10, 1900. 

The editor of the Democrat is in receipt of a notice from 
Jay Amos Barrett, assistant secretary ami librarian of the 
Nebraska State Historical Society, saying that one day of 
the annual meeting of that society in January will be devoted 
to the freighting days of the early ? (!0s, and requesting me to 
write a sketch of my observation and experiences in bullwhacking. 


t- lily my experience in this line does not materially 
Set from that of other men who piloted six yoke of cattle 
tched to eighty hundred of freight across the desert. Yet 
ere were many incidents connected with life upon the 
ains that have never been written. 

I There was scarcely a day passed but something occurred 
lit would furnish material upon which the writer of 
inance could build an interesting book of adventures. 

In the freighting days of the early 'GOs, the overland trail 
up the Platte river was a broad road two hundred or more feet 
in width. This was reached from various Missouri river 
points, as a great trunk line of railroad is now supplied by 
feeders. From Leavenworth, Atchison, and St. Joe, t! 
freighters who went the northern route crossed the Iiln« 
river at Marysville, Kan., Oketo, and other points, and traveled 
up the Little Blue, crossing over the divide and striking 
the big road at Pogtown, ten miles east of Port Kearney. 
Proa Nebraska City, which was the principal freighting 
point upon the river from 'G4 until the construction of the 
Union Pacific railroad, what was known as the steam wagou </seg>

Ed was the great trail. This fmler struck the Platte at a 
ut about forty miles east of Kearney. It derived its MOM 
ui an attempt to draw freight wagons over it by the use of 
mi, after the manner of the traction engine of to day. 

.My first trip across the plains was over this route, whic 
crossed the Big Blue a few miles above the present town J 
Crete. At the Blue crossing we were "organized," a detach 
incut of soldiers being there for that purpose, and no part 
of less than thirty men was permitted to pass. Under thi 
organization, which was military in its character, we wer 
required to remain together, to obey the orders of our "captain," 
and to use all possible precaution against the loss o 
our scalps and the freight and cattle in our care. 

IFhe daily routine of the freighter's life was to get up at 
! first peep of dawn, yoke up, and if possible get "strung 
t" ahead of other trains, for there was a continuous stretch 
white covered wagons as far as the eye could reach. 

E'ith the first approach of day, the night herder would 
e to camp and call the wagon boss. He would get up, 
nd upon each wagon, and call the men to '•turn out," and 
Id then mount his saddle mule and go out and assist in 
ing in the cattle. 

The corral was made by arranging the wagons in circular 
form, the front wheel of one wagon interlocking with the 
hind wheel of the one in front of it. Thus two half circles 
were formed, with a gap at either end. Into this corral the 
cattle were driven and the night herder watched one gap am 
the wagon boss the other, while the men yoked up. 

I he first step in the direction of yoking up was to hike 
r lead yoke upon your shoulder and hunt up your off 
ler. Having found your steer you put the bow around his 
k, and with the yoke fastened to him led him to your 
;on, where he was fastened to the wheel by a chain. You 
n took the other bow and led your near leader with it to 
place under the yoke. Your lead chain was then hooked 
he yoke and laid over the back of the near leader, and the 
</seg>

other cattle were hunted up and yoked in the same manner 
until the wheelers were reached, Having the cattle all yoke I, 
you drove them all out, chained together, and hitched them 
to the wagon. 

I The trot drive in the morning would probably he until ten 
•lock, or later, owing to the weather and distance between 
torable camping grounds. Cattle were then unyoked and 
e men got their lirst meal of the day. The cattle were 
iven in and yoked for the second drive any time from two 
four o'clock, the time of starting being governed by the 
at, two drives of ahout five to seven hours being made each 
jr. The rate of travel was about two miles an hour, or from 
t'lity to twenty-live miles a day, the condition of the roads 
il the heat governing. 

This, then, was the regular daily routine, though the yokg 
up of cattle was often attended with difficulty. Many 
eighting trains started from the Missouri river with not 
ore than two yoke of cattle, in the six that comprised each 
am, that had ever worn a yoke before. Many had to be 
¦oped,'' and not a few of the wildest, as the Texas and Cheioee 
varieties, were permitted to wear their yokes continually, 
or weeks. 

While the bull-whacker's life was full of that adventure 
and romance that possessed its fascination, there were some 
very rough sides to it, though, taking it all in all, it afforded 
an experience that few indeed would part with, and in after 
years there is nothing that I recall with more genuine pi 
ure than life in the camps upon the plains during the freight- 

SjK'aking of "good times," there has never been a time in 
the history of Nebraska that approached the good old freighting 
days. In those days there was a demand for men that has 
not since been known, and at wages unheard of before or 
since. 

Kin 1865 the wages paid the ordinary bull-whacker was $65 
month for the round trip, or |75 if discharged at the other </seg>

Bof the road. Mule-skinners got |75 for the round trip, 
|85 if discharged at the other end. 

It took about a month to drive from the Missouri river to 
Denver in those days, and as the wagons returned empty, a 
premium was paid for the man that would accept his discharge 
at the other end of the road. 

|!ut money didn't go far. The outfit of a teamster consisted 
jlankets and revolvers, and such clothing as he chose to 
e. The blankets were necessary, and no man would be 
uiitted to leave the river without abundant arms and am 
tiition. Every man wore a belt to which was attached one 
two revolvers of the large Colt type, and a sheath knife. 
; metallic cartridge had not yet come into general use, so 
t a powder flask, a cap box. and box of bullets were a neciry 
equipment, the men moulding their own bullets. Such 
outfit cost from $30 to $50, and the outfitting stores at 
&gt;raska City and other points did a land ottice business. 

Iiut the "good times" upon the plains during the freighting 
s were not confined to the mere mutter of money-making, 
'act, while the men who endured the hardships incident to 
i rough life and took chances with the hostile bands of 
ians that roamed the plains wanted good pay for their 
•ices, they only wanted the money for the pleasure that it 
ild buy. These men spent their money as freely as the air 
t they breathed, and upon the arrival of a big train at the 
Elephant corral in Denver, it was no unusual thing to 
the men buy a large portion of the town for the time being 
turn themselves loose. 

Ence halls had their fascinations, while gambling houses 
the finest orchestras to be had attracted men and women 
shades and conditions, to their gilded enclosures, where 
staked their all upon the turn of a card or the fall of

spent about the "buffalo chip" camp fire, watching the d\ in 
embers, smoking, singing, and telling yarns, many of wine 
would not be fit for the columns of a religious family new 
paper. Then there was the "stag dance," in which the boj 
were proficient, and occasionally an immigrant train woul 
camp near by, and the women would contribute to the fc 
tivitics of the occasion. 

I One of these dances occurred at Pat Mallaly's race on the 
atte, in 18G5, that for grace and elegance was unique. Au 
imigraut train bound for Washington camped near us, and 
there happened to be one of those old-time fiddlers of the 
Lrkansaw" type in the party, a dance was given in the Pilim 
house at the ranch. 

tThe Pilgrim house was a rude sod affair, with dirt floor, 
rt roof, and walls. It was supplied with an old cook stove, 
lere immigrants were permitted to camp and cook in 
nter. 

I There were present upon this occasion besides the team 
;rs in McLelan's outfit, of which the writer was a membe 
stage driver named Smith, who was away up in calling, am 
o women from the station, besides five from the immigran 
lin. This made it necessary for one man to take a lady 
rt in order to fill up the sets. The fiddler was perched upo 
inverted box upon the top of the old cook stove, and i 
y of the participants in that festive occasion are still o 
rth, they will recall the incident with no small degree o 
¦asure. 

tin this connection I might say that at least one of the men 
still on earth. I refer to Thomas Crummel, ex-mayor of 
lburn. He was my "partner'' on that trip, slept with me 
ider the same blankets, and a truer or more loyal fellow 
ver cracked a whip or stole a chicken from a ranchman. 

Thus it will be seen that in those rude days there were 
diversions that lightened the burden and made life bearable. 
These were the bright sjiots in the desert, the oases that retain 
their verdure, as we glance back over a life upon the plains </seg>

THE PAWNEE WAB OP 1859. 

THE PAWNEE WAR OF 1859. 

I the annual meeting of the Nebraska State Historical Society, January 10, 
1900, General John M. Thayer was introduced by President J. Sterling 
Morton, and spoke without notes upon the Pawnee campaign of 1859. His 
address was taken down in shorthand and prepared for publication. The 
introductory remarks of President Morton and General Thayer's address 
are given in full in the following pages. 

PUHMHT Morton — One of the important duties of th 
organization is to arrest fancy wherever it masquerades a 
fait ; and likewise to arrest and execute fiction where 
disguises itself so as to pass for truth. Now last evening 
paper was submitted here which contained this passag 
speaking of the Pawnee Indians and their raids upon th 
settlements: "Up the Elkhorn they robbed the settlers t 
such an extent that in 1859 the Governor of Nebraska calle* 
for volunteers and pursued the frightened fugitives up to th 
point now known, in memory of the closing scenes of the cam 
paign, as Battle Creek, Madison county. It was, however, 
bloodless battle. The little army of 300 were confronted b 
about 2,000 reds. . . The savage braves demanded battl 
claiming that though many of them might fall in the en 
counter, still in the end not a pale face would es&lt; -ape." 

There were further remarks which follow in this way: 

I "The event has been dignified in common parlance ant 
wspaper history as the Pawnee war. . . . Genera 
layer's upward career may have commenced here, for h 
ined some distinction in this campaign which paved th 
ly for him in the United States Senate and later in th 
ecutive chair of Wyoming and Nebraska." 

I discover present here this evening General Thayer, and I 
take great pleasure in calling him to this rostrum in order </seg>

Eit he may address you, giving you the facts relative to the 
wnee War, rather than fiction written by a gentleman who 
s then not a resident of Nebraska [great applause]. 

Gi:.\i:i;al Thayi;u — Mr. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen 
[applause] — 

!lr. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen — I am in this pos 
1 tonight as the result of the suggestions, or rather re 
sts. made to me this afternoon, that I come here an 
sent the facts in regard to the Pawnee War. It was in 
on seeomiag a citizen of this state, then a territory, to be 
sen liy the legislature to command the militia and yolui 
s whenever they should he called out; or, in other word 
lave the charge of the frontier of Nebraska and defeut 
settlers against the hostile Indians, and these duties 
i performing from 7&gt;r&gt; to 'fil, and I consented to appea 
B and make a statement in regard to the Pawnee War. 

I agree most fully with the remarks of the honored Pro 
dent in regard to our duty to eliminate fiction from fact, o 
rather to remove fiction wherever it has crept into the rea 
history of this state. In the last days of July, '59, courier 
came in from along the Elkhorn river over at where th 
crossing of the Elkhorn was. thirty or forty years ago, on tl 
then military road leading back to the mountains, and also 
from Fontanelle — I think I am right, do you remember, M 
Morton? [Mr. Morton: Where the woman was kille&lt; 
where one woman was killed. General Thayer continues] — 
informing us that the Pawnees, the whole tribe, was movin 
along the Elkhorn river and committing depredations, d 
stroying property, going into the cabins of the settlers, anc 
breaking up and destroying their little furnishings. And 
remember also this fact, reporting that they had found som 
feather beds that the settlers had brought with them froi 
their eastern homes, and had caused a reign of terror from tl 
lower Elkhorn up by way of Fontanelle. It was the prim 
pal town out northwest from Omaha beyond there, includin 
West Point, and reaching around then to Tekamah. Th </seg>

couriers came demanding protection of the government. Th 
governor was then at Nebnaka City — Governor Samue 
Black, who lived there; it was his home. The informatio 
and demand was so pressing that the most prompt action wa 
necessary. At that time your honored President, Mr. Moi 
ton, was secretary of the Territory, and he was occupyin 
his office in the then state house, which was in Omaha. Th 
organic law provided that in the absence of the governor froi 
the Territory the secretary should then exercise and perform 
the duties of governor, hut only in the governor's absenc 
from the Territory. Well, the question arose for a monien 
whether the secretary, Mr. Morton, could assume the duties 
of executive. There was a brief consultation between him 
and myself in one of the stores on Farnam street in Omah. 
We took but a few minutes to consider that question. I d 
sired that he should assume the responsibility of goveruo 
and issue the orders to me to march to the defense of our be 
leaguered settlers on the border. Well, without hesitatio 
he decided to do so, and issued the order to me to move to th 
defense of the settlers, knowing that perhaps the questio 
night be raised afterwards as to the authority of his act, am 
also as to the authority of my act. I executed his order. Bu 
he had no hesitation in taking the responsibility, and I ha 
none in executing the order. I raised about forty men i 
Omaha, and we left that city at midnight, and by fou 
o'clock the next afternoon we entered Fontanelle, where a 
the people had gathered from afar above the Elkhorn am 
below it. All the cabins and homes of the settlers wei 
abandoned; all were gathered in there; and I rememl)er we 
the appearance of the people there when we reached Fonta 
nelle and marched into the town. They were overjoyed a 
seeing us, at witnessing our arrival, for they knew then tha 
something was to be done for their protection. I remaine&lt; 
there two days in gathering up a force for the purpose of pur 
suing the Pawnees. The men were anxious to unite with us, 
for they had suffered from the Pawnees before, and they dc- </seg>

sired to have some satisfaction from them, and I was of th 
same mind. They had given me a great deal of trouble 
three times I had been to the Pawnee village and held a coun 
cil with the chief, and they would always make all kinds o 
promises to me, only to break them afterwards. The chie 
would lay the trouble upon their young men, the braves, sa\ 
I ii jr that they could not control them. I told them that the 
must control them or that the government would send a fore 
upon them and wipe them out if they didn't control thci 
men. Of course I had to talk large to make an impression 
Well, we organized there and raised a force, including tho&gt; 
who accompanied me from Omaha, of 194 men. I had take 
with us one piece of artillery from Omaha, the only one tli 
Territory had, and thus organized, and laying in a supply o 
provisions for the expedition, for I could not tell how Ion 
we would be out, we took the trail of the Pawnees and follower 
them. There were in that tribe then about 5,000 Indian 
males, females, and children. They had cut quite a will 
swath along the west bank of the Elkhorn, they having 50 
and odd of ponies. They had turned them into all the whec 
fields and corn fields where the crops were then growing pn 
fusely and cut down everything. Their destruction was coir 
plete, and it was enough to inspire the frontiersmen with 
determination to secure some satisfaction. I should have ex 
plained this: that it was impossible to communicate wit 
(Jovernor Black at Nebraska City within from two to three 
days. There were then no telegraph lines, and letters an 
messengers had to cross the Missouri at Omaha on a fla 
boat over to Council Bluffs, and then on down en the low 
side to Plattsmouth, and cross the Missouri there back agai 
on the flat-boat to the Nebraska side. You can see that thu 
the communication between Nebraska City and Omaha coul 
not be carried on except at a very slow pace. We could m 
wait for communications with Governor Black, and hence tl 
governor [Morton] at once took the responsibility to r*i 
though we had reasons for believing that Governor Ei;^;

was then in the Territory, and, if thoroughly scrutinized 
[our action] in assuming the duties might be called in ques 
tion. But I say it now in his presence, that I was gratefu 
to him that he did take the action and gave me the orders 
as the executive of the Territory, for I felt and I knew it wa 
our duty to stop the outrages which were then being carriei 
on, and secure protection from the Pawnees. 

Then General Samuel 11. Curtis, a distinguished citizen o 
Keokuk, Iowa, who was a graduate of West Point and fo 
some years served in the regular army and had been enginee 
for the government, was there at that time, a member of Con 
gress from that district in which Keokuk is located. He wa 
of a military turn of mind, and, hearing of the action we ha&lt; 
taken, and that a force had started from Omaha, of his own 
volition, and prompted by a patriotic and military spirit, h 
followed us, and overtook us, I think, perhaps two days ou 
from Omaha. I was very glad to receive him, because I kneA 
he had had a military education, was really a military man 
and the only experience I had had was in contact with th 
Indians. The Pawnees and then the Sioux would make m 
a great deal of trouble, making me sometimes wish that I ha( 
never accepted a commission, given me by the first legislature 
of brigadier-general, and the second session enlarging my 
sphere of duty and making me a major general. I appointe&lt; 
General Curtis "inspector general on my staff. I desired t 
give him recognition, for I had a great respect for the man 
know him well. He had visited Omaha frequently when h 
w;is on his political campaigns, and he was a very valuabl 
man. I had also invited a Lieutenant Robinson, of the regu 
lar army, who was in command of the Eighteenth Dragoon 
of Cavalry, then being designated "Dragoons," to join me in 
the expedition, and he did so. 

We then organized the expedition more fully, and I desired 
to give him the compliment of an appointment — Lieutenant 
Robinson — and the command, at my suggestion, 
elected him as colonel under me and he was a valuable ac- </seg>

quisition. We moved along, I think, one day after General 
Curtis joined me, when Governor Black, hearing that we had 
moved from Omaha, came into that city as rapidly as he could 
i here, and then followed us, taking our trail, and followed 
alone until he came up with us, I think the fourth night. 
Now, Governor Black was as perfect a gentleman, I think. ;is 
I ever met, with one exception. When he was himself he was 
a gentleman. He was an able man ; he was a good lawyer ; he 
had been a judge of the southern district of Nebraska before 
Buchanan appointed him governor of the Territory. He was 
an orator, a polished gentleman, with this exception, and it 
was the most unfortunate one — he would sometimes get 
tight. I suppose you all know what that means [laughter]. 
Sometimes, well perhaps four or live months, he would get 
on a regular tear, — beastly drunk, I am sorry to say. I want 
to inject this remark right here that I have never related this 
incident which I am about to give you, except to a few friends. 
I have never given it to the public and declined to write anything 
about it. I may state right here that when he left Nebraska 
he went back to Pennsylvania, the state from which 
he came, and was commissioned as colonel of a Pennsylvania 
regiment, at the head of which he was shot in the head while 
leading his regiment into battle at Ohancellorsville — one of 
those battles in West Virginia. He thus died honorably for 
his country. I have thought perhaps his Wlddw might be living, 
or some child of his still living, and I didn't desire to 
stale fullv this statement 

(And this afternoon several gentlemen said to me, "This 
bject of the Pawnee War and the paper presented last night 
*e discussed there." I regretted very much that circum- 
LBCes prevented my being here last evening to hear the 
per to which your honorable President made allusion, or 
im which he rend an extract, — and they said give the whole 
story of it. And as there has been some misrepresentation,

I foundation. Not being a resident of the Territory, an 
king whatever he did write, I suppose, from hearsay, h 
1 great injustice to those who composed that force, am 
K) to Governor Morton and myself. It was, — I might sa 
;ht here, for fear it may not occur to me again, — a very in 
rtant expedition, and it was, I deemed, — though I did n: 
the time — that it was a most hazardous one. We wer 
rsuing a force where the Indians numbered 1,400 warriors 
d my force was only 194 men and a single piece of artillery 
an see now that it was a dangerous one, and yet I endoa\ 
2d to take in the full force (if the situation. I was de•mined 
to inflict some punishment upon the Pawnees fo 
1 demands made upon me by the Governor every time, tha 
nust go to the Pawnees and induce them to compel tho» 
io committed the depredations to cease. It had become, as 
laid, somewhat monotonous, and this was in particular. 

We had gotten beyond the pale of civilization, there was 
nothing before us, nor upon either side of us, east or west. We 
had gotten into the wilderness of prairie, and we were a kind 
of free lance. I have said Governor Morton [General 
Thayer meant Governor Black (ripple)] overtook us, I think 
the fourth night after we had left Fontanelle. I found at 
once, as soon as he came into camp, that he had been partaking 
too freely [laughter and applause] of stimulants, and I 
began to think that I might have trouble with him. Well, at 
nijjht, before we retired, 1 discovered that he was pretty 
drunk. He was the governor and my commander-in-chief. 
As you all know, the civil power is supreme over the military ; 
he was ahead of me. I began to inquire with myself what 
course I should take with him, for, knowing his propensity, 
and knowing when he was under the influence of liquor he was 
an exceedingly disagreeable acquaintance. He was, — oh, I 
can't hardly describe it, — because I knew after he commenced 
partaking of liquor he would become beastly drunk. 
That night while he was asleep I got hold of his demijohn 
under the hind seat of the ambulance and took it out, and </seg>

took out the stopple. I held it upside down, and you kno\ 
wliat happened, and poured out the whisky. Bat the next tla 
I found he had a small bottle which I had not nea or diseoi 
end, from which he was still drinking. Be beat me there. I 
the middle of the day we went into camp. We had bee 
inarching since an early hour of the morning, for the weatlu 
was very hot, and I endeavored to make as much distance a 
possible in the earlier part of the forenoon, when there wool 
he less heat. 80 we went into camp at noon; to give th 
men and animals about two or three hours' rest was m 
plan, lie was so unfit to be about that I had two soldiei 
help him into a small tent, which I had pitched on purpm 
for him, to keep him from the rest of the command. I trie* 
to save him as much as possible from the sight of the sole! 
but too many of them knew what his propensity was. We! 
during that time of rest the men were lying under the bag¦ 
wagons to get in the shade as much as possible, and I 
was under one on the outside of the camp, when Colonel Kobinson 
came to me and said : "General, I'm in trouble." I said, 
'•What is the matter, colonel?" "Why,"' he said, "Governor 
Black sent for me to come to his tent and I went there." He 
being the commander-in-chief and Colonel Robinson a regular 
officer, knows no duty but to obey the orders of a superior 
oflicer. He went to the tent, and, pulling the flaps aside, there 
&lt; Jovernor Black lay on the ground, and, raising himself up on 
his elbow, he said, "Colonel Ilobinson," in that maudlin way, 
"1 order you to take seventy-five men and go over to Columbus 
— that was away to the south of us — "and procure 
twenty barrels of whisky and four sacks of flour." [Laugh- 

Now that is the literal order which Colonel Robinson assured 
me Governor Black gave him, and some soldiers were 
near the tent on the outside, and they overheard it. There 
was no mistake about it ; there was the exact orders. The ire 
and indignation of those soldiers was aroused at once. They 
began to say, — and there was some cursing and swearing like </seg>

this : "I'll be damned if I ever came out on the prairie to execute 
such an order." There was a spirit of mutiny. As llob 
iiisun heard them aud spoke to me, I sprang up as soon a 
p-ssible and mounted my horse and rode in front of the wlioi 
command, and, in as loud a voice as I could command — and 
think I could then be heard over a good section of prairi 
when I was in earnest — I called to the men: "attention 
iiattauon! fall into ranks! pkepaue to MARCH !'' I mad 
it as impressive as possible to have its effect on the men. I 
was instantaneous. Every man rose to his position and wa 
ready to obey my orders. There was no sign of mutiny afte 
that. I settled that question. I ought to have said in th 
lirst place that it is very unpleasant for me to relate incident 
irbere I am obliged to refer to myself, but I could not mak 
tins statement without doing so, although it is not to m, 
taste. I have generally avoided relating any reminiscences 
in which I have taken a part for that reason, and I beg tha 
you will not think that I am doing it now, — and so I say 
only do it because I was obliged to do it. The men all too 
their places in rank, companies were told off ready for th 
inarch. I then detailed two soldiers and ordered them to 
take Governor Black from the tent, put him into the ambi 
lam e and take seats with him. If he objected, I said, "Pit 
him into the ambulance at all liazard*." Well, sometimes i 
the life of a man the time comes when he must act upon th 
instant — promptly. It is an emergency which require 
prompt action, and I knew if I had not given the order t 
the men to fall in and prepare to march, that expedition 
would have broken up there in disgrace. I could not hot 
the men there under any law because they were not enlistet 
men; they were real volunteers, having taken no oath of offie 
and having joined in the expedition without being musterei 
in, there being no officer authorized to muster in. So I couh 
not have held the men there except by letting them see, a 
once, that authority was still there, that I was their com 
niander, and took the responsibility of arresting the governo </seg>

and keeping him as a prisoner until the drunkenness ho&lt;

with him. He behaved reasonably well with them, and whe 
we arrived in camp I had the teut pitched for him only, am 
the two soldiers in charge of him took him in there. WhetliL 
he had formed a realizing sense of his condition then or not 
was not certain; but I was not going to take any chances, 
held him a prisoner until the second morning after that, gi 
ing them orders not to allow him to leave the ambulant 
under any circumstances, nor anybody else to have any eom 
municatiou with him but myself, but giviug them the ordi 
that if be desired to see me, or desired to leave the ambulane 
to rej&gt;ort to me at once, and I would attend to it. Well, th 
next morning the expedition resumed its march, and he wa 
gradually sobering off; he exhausted his supply of whisk 
which he had in his small bottle, and he found he could ge 
none from the demijohn. We moved along that day, sto 
ping for nooning near the Elkhorn river. We were all tl 
time on the south side of the Elkhorn. When we passe 
where the town of West Point now is there were only five o 
abandoned cabins. They had all gathered into Font 
nelle. That was the last sign of human habitation until « 
leached the Pawnees, — I may be permitted to remark her 
that it gave me an excellent opportunity to see what N 
braska was then in the wilderness, away from civilization. 
was a beautiful landscape as my eyes ever rested upon, 
wondered almost why the Almighty did not locate the Garde 
of Eden in this Territory that was so lovely beyond descrip 
tion; the tall grass of the prairie, rich verdure of green, th 
birds flitting around to some extent from little twigs, — there 
were no trees there except over on the Elkhorn, which w 
were in sight of all the time, I believe. We passed where tl 
towns on the Elkhorn road have since been located, ori 
inally, within a range of two or three miles of thos 
cities. Where Norfolk now is there was not a sign o 
habitation. </seg>

One afternoon we were on the watch for the Pawnees 
realizing that we were drawing near to them ; it was of th 
utmost importance that no information should reach them 
that soldiers were pursuing them. It was, I remarked, 
hazardous expedition, and I was blamed a great deal afte 
wards, I found, for taking that command where I did, 19 
men against 1,400 Indian warriors. It was a rather remar 
able position. Having had some experience afterwards i 
the late Civil War, I can say that I can remember of no Me 
sion when such a small body of men were to be pitted agains 
such an immense number of men. But my men I knew to be 
trustworthy. They were frontiersmen, indeed. They wer 
fighting men. They were those who had gone into their fieh 
to cultivate the soil with a rifle by their side and laid it dow 
when they were performing their work on their claims, am 
having it ready to go to their homes if any Indians appeare&lt; 
In that way they were living — constantly on the qui t'v 
watching for Indians; and thus they were prepared. The 
were schooled for such service as they w'ere then engaged i 
with me, and I felt the utmost confidence in them ; thorough! 
armed with rifles, shotguns, and muskets, which they kne 
so well how to use, while the Indians, 1,400 of them, — and 
learned that number from an interpreter who had been wil 
me on my visit to the Pawnee village to hold a council — M 
A , a most excellent man, who had been employed as in 
terpreter by the government — it is not the Indians who gav 
me that statement — that they numbered about 1,400 fight in 
men, but they were poorly armed ; some of them with the ol 
flint-lock musket. Well, having thus the utmost confidenc 
in my men I should not have hesitated to have met them i 
the open field. I had one instrument along which I kne 
carried fear to the Indians, and that was the cannon; but 
was on the watch to see that no person passed us, any othe 
Indian passing on in the direction of the Pawnees to inform 
them that soldiers were pursuing them. In the afternoo 
about four o'clock we met an Omaha Indian who was com

ing from the direction to which we were marching. I stopped 
him and questioned him about the Pawnees. He could spea 
a little English so that I could understand him ; and he in 
formed me as near as he could that they were in camp abou 
nine miles further on. Being four o'clock in the afternoo 
and verv warm — we could make the march between on 
o'clock in the morning and dawn to the Pawnee camp — w 
went into camp right there, as we were near a stream o 
water, and the men and .animals rested until one o'clock i 
the morning, when camp was broken; the train of baggage 
wagons hitched up and everything in readiness and we moved 
forward rapidly. I could gage the movement, speed, or 
rather the time, by the rapidity with which the marching 
went on. I could calculate by the hour at what time we 
would strike their camp. I had formed that plan from the 
beginning, so as to come upon them at break of day. As we 
passed over a rising ground, not exactly a steep hill, we came 
in sight of their camp. The day was just breaking; we could 
see the smoke curling from their teepees and the squaws 
running hither and thither gathering up brush and wood and 
building their fires in order to cook their breakfasts. Well, 
I gare the order for the command to charge, and the charge 
went, helter, skelter. The cavalry of 194 were all mounted 
with fleet horses, and they did charge; they went with the 
&lt;1 of the wind almost, and that old cannon lumbered along 
over the hillocks, and little chug holes, but it kept pretty nea 
up with us, and the baggage wagons followed ; and the cav 
airy, and the tramp of horses, nearly 200, the baggage wagon 
all going upon the jump, made a tremendous noise on th 
prairies, which attracted the attention of the squaws. Tin 
saw us coming. We could see them running into their cam 
to get the male Indians out. You know the squaws perform 
all the drudgery; they get the underbrush and the wood and 
the water, and do the cooking, while the lazy, lousy, measly 
Indians lay in their tents for their women to do all the 
drudgery. And that is the reason why I have never had much 
respect for the Indians. </seg>

Once while I was holding council with the chiefs in thei 
village, some miserable vagabonds of Indians went wa 
around after I had gotten into the great council tent of th 
Indians, got into our wagons, there were four of them, wine 
we left on the eastern side of the river, and stole every bit o 
provisions we had, while the chief was promising everythin 
to prevent the Indians from committing further depredation 
I just mention this. My wife, when I knew that I had to go, — 
she knew about what kind of food suited us — she worked a 
one night frying doughnuts, over a peck of them, nearly ha 
a bushel ; boiled a ham, baked nine loaves of bread and som 
other things; and when I left Massachusetts a friend gav 
me a bottle of very choice brandy. I thought I would tak 
that along for snake bites, and those rascally Indians stole i 
while the chiefs were promising that they should commit n 
more depredations; — wont to my wagon and took everythin 
we had in it. We had crowed back from their village, and 
was anticipating a good meal ; we hadn't a thing to eat. Yo 
need not be surprised if I had lost confidence in the Indian 
This is only one instance of their treachery of which I hav 
known — but to resume : 

We charged upon the village, and as we approached w 
could see the male Indians just coming out of their teepees 
and as inv men came up right in front of them into line th 
cavalry formed in line, the artillerymen had their piece 
loaded, and the guns were loaded of the cavalrymen, ant 
while the chiefs were rushing out towards us, some of then 
held up a white wolf skin in token of surrender, and, slapping 
their breasts, some of them could utter these words, "M 
good Indian." 

"Old Peter," the chief of the Pawnees, whom I had met in 
those interviews, recognized me and I recognized him. He 
made a rush right to my bowse's head, wrapping the starry 
banner around him which Buchanan had given him, exclaiming, 
"Me good Indian, — good Indian, — can not shoot under 
this flag." He had that idea about the value of the flag. </seg>

            <seg id="p245">

While these demonstrations of surrender were going on, while 
our troops came into line, I had the order upon my lips to 
file It was niv chance at the Indians; I wanted a little satisfaction 
for the way they had treated me. When I had been 
in their village they had robbed me of everything I had to eat. 
I had that word upon my lips' to my men, who were watching 
me closely and constantly witli their ritles poised, and the 
artillerymen ready to touch oil their gun, when some invisible 
agency seemed to hold me back. I had time to realize this, 
that if I bed upon them I should be charged with having 
been fjuilty of inhuman massacre, for my men with that piece 
of artillery would have mowed down hundreds of them. The 
women were mixed with the male Indians and could not be 
separated. I say some invisible, Indescribable agency held me 
back. I did not give the order. Now, I have rejoiced since 
and do now rejoice that I did not; for the result afterward 
was accomplished without shedding blood. I say they surrendered 
completely. There was never a more perfect surri-nder 
than there was there, and that was the reason, under 
the influence of something. jK-rhaps higher than I, held me 
back. The result was that they turned over to me six or eight 
of the men who they claimed had been guilty of the depredation 
upon the whites. They entered into written stipulations, 
I think, that the expenses of claims resulting from the 
distinction of the property of the settlers should be taken 
out of their annuities — nothing more could be required of 
them — and we remained there a part of the day and started 
on our homeward inarch towards Columbus to get on the military 
road. Two or three Indians were brought into Omaha 
and put in jail there and kept there for some time, — the supposed 
guilt}- ones. But I went off to the war in the South 
and did not keep run of them. There was never a depredation 
committed upon any settler afterward. They were completely 
cowed easily by the display of my force there to whom they 
had surrendered. Thus the object was accomplished, for they 
became friends of the whites. But this fact was accomplished, </seg>

also; the fim i mi il took immediate steps to put tlie Paw 
ntcs on their reservation in Nance county, where the town o 
Genoa is situated, and put an agent out OB their reservatioi 
who remained with them. Thus there was accomplished tha 
which we were seeking, perfect peace with the Pawnees froi 
that time forward; thus it was accomplished without th 
¦bedding of blood, because it would have been a fearful mas 
¦acre if we had fired upon them. That expedition was an in 
portanl one; not only for the people, but for the Indians 
They made peace and they submitted to the authority of th 
goreraor, and maintained peace, and they furnished fou 
companies of Pawnee Indians, who were organized as Paw 
net- scouts, who served with the government troops in thei 
wars tgmiaflt the Indians on the plains. They were wit 
&lt; leneral Crook and other Indian fighters, and performed inos 
useful services. 

Now, sometimes an attempt has been made to belittle tha 
expedition. I say, having been in it, and commanded it, it wa 
a most important expedition, and as hazardous and daring a 
any that ever came under my observation during the Civi 
War. It is a piece in our history of which I am proud fo 
the effects which it produced — the results which they ac 
complished; and when anybody seeks to belittle it, or an 
member of that expedition, he knows not what he is talkin 
about Those men who composed that force of 104 men wer 
brave, as heroic, as any soldiers that I ever saw in the Civ 
war. They were soldiers in reality. And they were inspire! 
by the noblest of motives, which were to protect their fam 
lies, their children. If you make it safe for other settlers 1 
come into Nebraska and settle under a government wher 
they knew the flag would be respected and they should be respected 
in the enjoyment of their rights — that expedition di&lt;

tory, ¦—ling, them that they should he protected in the enjoyment

EABLY DAYS IN THE INDIAN COCNTEY. 

EARLY DAYS IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY. 

I following address was delivered at the animal meeting of the Nebraska 
State Historical Society, January 10. 1WQ, by Major C. Anderson, of 
York, Neb. Major Anderson at the time was seventy-six years old. tall 
and athletic in figure, and with touches of frontier dialect in his story that 
ma le the audience at times burst into peals of laughter. His address was 
delivered without notes and taken down in shorthand. 

Majok Anderson — I wish to say that I am no public 
speaker. I am here simply by request to tell you something 
about my earliest experiences iu this western country, or, 
rather, Indian Territory. It would be well first to describe 
what was known at that time as the Indian Territory. It was 
from the western line of Missouri eight hundred miles west 
to the Rocky mountains, with the exception that New Mexico, 
as now it is, was claimed by Old Mexico, and Texas 
then, as you know, was in dispute. Mr. Houston and S.inta 
Anna were not altogether quite satisfied with the results. 
The western border of Missouri and the Arkansas river — I 
believe that the State of Arkansas claimed all the territory 
south of the Arkansas river — the balance of it went clear 
to the British possessions, and it was then in dispute, as 
it is now, as to the geographical line. All of that v:ist 
country was inhabited by savages, and some of the very 
worst type; and some of them were cannibals. I left my 
home in Knightstown, in 1S40, a boy sixteen years of age. 
Previous to that time there was an old Revolutionary soldier, 
relative of mine, and I used to accompany him on his trappings. 
He was a great trapper, and I accompanied him on 
his trapping expeditions. We trapped all over northern 
Indiana and eastern Ohio and Illinois, and he also taught 
me how to prepare the pelts for the Market Well, when I 
left home in 1840, I went up into what was known then in </seg>

Indiana as the Western Reserve, among the Wyandot 
Indians; in tact, I staved with them and trapped all through, 
afoag tlic various streams, along the Wabaah river, and the 
A\"liite river, and those other streams; and finally I came 
down tu the Illinois river and I loaded my pelts on a boat, 
and took then to St. Louis and sold them. While I was 
at St. Louis Genera] Houston, of Confederate fame, came 
up from Louisiana, came up from Baton Kouge, with some 
troops to reinforce the fortifications, or, rather, to protect 
the western portion of Iowa, and I got permission to 
tome along, and I fitted myself out with traps to go with 
them. I went with them across the state, and I found at 
Dei Moinea river, where the North Coon empties into the 
river, right along the bank next to the river — to North 
11 — was the barracks. It had lieen occupied by some 
troops, and I think they had moved farther up the river, 
up towards Fort Dodge, I think it was. Well, now, I stayed 
that winter at the barracks there; I helped build those barracks, 
and I trapped up the Des Ifoiaea river and up the 
North Coon, and I got quite a good stock of pelts — now mind 
you what the value of these pelts were at that time. We got 
$8 a pound for beaver, and one beaver skin would weigh 
from one and one half to two pounds, so you can see what 
profit there was in it. Well, while I was at Des Monies 
I got acquainted with -Old (Jreen." Any person here that 
is from Iowa will remember "Old Green," who was the chief 
of the Sac and Fox Indians. I was pretty familiar with 
these Indians, and I got on good terms with them; and they 
had a lodge in what we called then the "Three-river Country." 
and I am told that they started a town — there's a town 
there since by [the name of J Winterset, I believe it is on the 
map. I stayed that winter with old Chief Green. Then I got 
an opportunity to go with the government wagons to the 
river; took my pelts along with me, and I disposed of them 
at St. Louis; and I fitted myself out then again, thinking I 
would go back into Iowa, with some trinkets — beads and </seg>

such things — that the Indians wanted ; but when I got to 
St. Louis 1 saw a boat there loaded with wagons, ox yokes, 
chains, and things that were needed out here on the plains; 
and instead of going to Leaveuworth I got oil" at Independence, 
Mo. And now I will read you the letter that I 
wrote to the secretary here; we — and then I want to tell you, 
if I have the time, of two battles that I was in here out in 
the West. I was in several skirmishes, and some pretty 
serious ones, and also I want to tell you that this battle 
that I am going to tell you about, and one that I was not 
in — there was two battles you might say, the one that I was 
in and the one that I was not in [applause] ; the one that I 
was in — I want to tell you about that after I read my letter. 
And then one that I was not in I will tell you about [ripple 
in the audience] ; and I will tell you all the parties that took 
part in it; they are familiar. I see there are some soldiers 
here; Colonel Kussell and others here that I know that were 
familiar with these men. [Ilere reads letter. After reading 
a portion he says:] I wish to say that I can write a little 
better than I can talk [laughter]. [Remarks coutinued:] 
Now I want to tell you a little incident here. There was a 
gentleman "Major Drummer," — you know what that is, — 
that is a man that has charge of the teams, of the wagons. 
lit- died a few years ago; he lived in Missouri at Freeport, 
now Kansas City; but he moved. The last account I had 
of him he went to the town of Knox, that is in Kansas 
somewhere. He sized me up when I went up to him and 
asked him if I could get a job of driving the teams. 
Now, then, they didn't drive teams then like you would drive 
a team. (There was the first Mexican I ever saw.) But they 
had five or six teams, or span of mules, to one wagon, and 
slashing around from right to left like you would oxen in 
our country. And this man Brown, he looked at me a little 
while, and I had a gun, — I'll tell you I got a gun made, a 
rifle just after my own notion, at St. Louis, but it was the 
old style. We didn't have caps; we could not always get </seg>

I me just in time to vote for Abraham Lincoln, the first 
te I ever cast in my life. Then, to back that up I enlisted 
an Indiana regiment, Wallace's regiawat, and I was in 
eral hard battles. [The speaker continues parenthetily] 
I never like to tell that,— but I have always made 
a rule to present the bright side of the picture; the dark 
bad enough at best, but that has been all my life a rule 
it I have made. One object I have in making this stateut 
is simply this: Mv friends and some of my children 
re requested me to give the public my experience in this 
stern country; and I have this last summer made up my 
nd that I would do it. 

I[ have just returned from my old stamping ground down 
Santa Fe and those places, for the puipum of refreshing 
¦ mind of some incidents that I had partially forgotten; 
t it was one of the most saddest things to me to go up 
old Santa Fe, the old burying grounds, and look over the 
I tombs that were there. I fuund one man that I was 
uiliar, — acquainted with; that was Kit Carson; all heard 
him; his friends had taken up his bones and taken them 
¦k east. Now I will tell you lirst of the battle that I was 
t in [laughter]. And I got a card, — well, in fact, Charles 
nt and Fremont, and quite a number of prominent men 
de this remark about it afterwards, "That it was one of the 
iractcristics of the boy.' That was the way they framed 
I was trapping up on the Glorietta mountains; there 
re seven of us. The Glorietta mountains is the divide 
ween the Kio Grande and the Bed river. You know we 
rays had to have a guard. A number of us would sleep 
ile the others remained on watch. Because these Indians 

I you could not trust them scarcely at all; they would sli

get to you. So I was out in the morning right early. 
(1 slept pretty well all the night, and I thought I wouh

tains, and it had been a little skift of snow. I bad not went 
¦tore thiin fifteen or twemty steps from our camp until I 
sctii a big track right in the snow. Well now, you know 
we liad other animals to contend with out there besides the 
Indians. We had the cinnamon bear, the black bear, and 
the big chief, the grizzly bear, — but the grizzly bear was not 
such a terrible man-eater as most people think for. But in all 
probability they have violated some of the laws, — no doubt 
about it [laughter]. But I knew it was a grizzly bear the 
minute I saw the track. I went up on the side of the cliff, 
up on top of the cliff, and there was a clear piece of ground, 
about an acre. I pushed some underbrush away from it and 
looked through, and I found the bear in a cave with six 
others, — do, live others. Well, I knew it was suicidal to 
make the attack, and if there was anything on God's heavens 
that a bear dislikes it is a cowardly enemy. So, what else 
could I do? I just stood and looked at it and never moved 
hand or foot; I knew it was no use. And one of those came 
right up at me pretty near, probably half as far as across 
the room, and then go back, and started out again and 
dared me. I took it as ;i dare — I didn't expect to be entertained 
in a convention of bears [great laughter]. I felt that 
I was an intruder, the fact of the business; so I stood pretty 
still. They made several stichc.zs backwards and forwards, 
and finally one of them took a jump and away they went 
and all the rest followed suit; and they were so panic-stricken 
that they ran through the camp and over one or two of my 
comrades there lying asleep, and knocked the camp kettle 
over and put out the fire. 

I Now I will tell you about the battle that I was not in

Kearney took his command and went on across the mountains 
to California; and he left OoL Sterling Price in command. 
Taos was my old home; and I still have some inter 
there. My children are there now. So, at Taos they 
had formed a conspiracy to kill every white or foreigner 
that was in that country. Ferdinand at Taos pueblo established 
a large church that was built of adobe, that was about 
two miles,— they had selected that place to start. So they 
commenced in the morning, and they just killed and butchered 
every man, woman, and child that they came to with 
the exception of those who had gray eyes and light hair, 
the children. That was a mark,— they drew the line 
you know, — those men that had went out there had married 
.Mexican women, and their children had light hair, — but a 
good many of them that did not save, so the report came 
to us. I was up on the Rio (irande at the time, seventeen 
of us, and there was other trappers at Pueblo and this other 
town, I forget the name of it, where the Hough Riders met 
this summer, — there was another squad there. And one of 
these men had got knowledge of the fact that they were 
being murdered, or just wholesale slaughter of the people 
that was there, so we gathered up and went to Santa IV. 
and Colonel Price only had but a few men. Kearney had 
taken most of his men, but we went anyhow; we got what 
men we had, and other men, all volunteers; we went with 
them, and we found them in this old church; they had 
done their work, and was fortified, as they supposed, inside 
of this church. Well, now, we had to storm that 
church. There were sixty men of us, and I think there was 
L'L'.j that bit the dust, and we lost six. Now that battle </seg>

started in the morning, and it lasted all day, the whole 
livelong day. I was suing to tell you I never see anything 
equal it in the Rebellion, and I was all through it. It lasted 
all day, and when we got through at night it was kill or be 
killed — that was all there was in it; that was the sum of 
the whole business, ami, of eourse, a man is going to strive 
desperately hard to save his own life, and we knew that. But 
they got half of our number, and we took twelve prisoners, 
and those were court niartialed and hung. That was the 
final result of (hose men; I believe one of them got away, I 
am told that one got away; that was one of the men that 
was instigators of the revolt. Now, ladies and geutlenieu. 
I have taken up, I expect, a good deal more time, — I could 
talk an hour and not tell you half what there is to be told. 
Uut there is one thing I might say, if they will indulge me 
with the time. I have had, I presume, as much experience 
with the Indian as most any man now, — I presume as much 
as any man living; and I found that the Pueblo Indians were 
the only Indians, — that is the Aztec Indians — there is three 
classes, the Navajo, the Aztecs, and Coiuanches are all of 
the same family, but they are subdivided and they have the 
same language just the same as the Pueblo, as we call them, 

— just the same as the Sioux, Sacs, and Foxes. Those Aztecs 
ere the Montezuuias, and I think it was the greatest pity 
lat ever happened that those picture writings that these 
ouks kept when they took the City of Mexico were shut off 
on there, that would connect these people with the Mexiius 
or with the Pueblos, just the same time as they had 
cture writing in Egypt. I think it was a grand mistake 
n destroying that picture writing, because it was very intersting 
to know that they had a pretty good state of civilizaon, 
and they had the knowledge and — the worst of all is 
Kit with all of our educational interests, the government 
istains them there in their reservation and keeps them up, 
ud they commit some of the most outrageous, dastardly 
ork that could ever be conceived by the mind of man, in </seg>

thing, my opinion — I've got my own opinion about it, yo 
uiiiy have another opinion, and others may have other opin 
ions — but I believe, notwithstanding all the money that ha 
been paid to educate those Indians — it is just simply lik 
this; you take an Indian and civilize him, and you polis

NEBRASKA STATE HISTOHICAL SOCIETY. 

FREIGHTING TO DENVER. 

Address delivered by T. K Tyson at the meeting of the Nebraska State His 
torical Society, January 10, 1900. Taken down in shorthand for pub 
lication. 

Ms. Tyson — My acquaintance with Nebraska only began 
four years before it had a name. We called it "Over the 
River." But it is not so much a time to tell about the things 
that happened so kmg ago, though my father's family had 
somewhat to do with the early days of Nebraska, even before 
it had a name. But my first trip across the plains was in 
V.4. I left the farm of Moses Stocking, whom all old settlers 
know, on the 16th of May, 18G4. For my team I had a good 
stout yoke of stags, and they were on the tongue, a sprightly 
young yoke of steers in the lead, a yoke of wild steers that 
we caught up that very morning and yoked for the first 
time; a yoke of cows, — and I want to say this much for the 
cow on the road : I never saw a lazy cow in the yoke, but I 
have seen horrible lazy steers. We started to learn very 
soon the truth of that song that all the old frontiersmen 
known, to the tune of "Hoot Hog, or Die." [Song inserted 
here.] Another beautiful poem that we learned when we 
were alone, "llow to Turn a Flap-jack." I don't think I was 
ever a very accomplished frontiersman because they could 
turn a flap-jack to a nicety, cooking his flap-jack on his 
fry-pan over the coals, with the fuel of the plains; when 
it is just about done so that a woman would take a cake 
turner and turn it, he would just take it and throw it up 
and down it would come. I could never do that; it would 
come down on its edge and go to smash, and the smoke from 
the bacon and the fire would cover your face and nearly 
suffocate you. There was a beautiful poem that used to go 
something like this (the refrain is ''Ouch-Ouchy, Wouchy- </seg>

            <seg id="p258">
257 

FREIGHTING TO DENVER. 

fichy"). And I have heard that told a thousand times, 
y times when a man was about suffocated with smoke, 
made our journey from Plattsmouth, arriving on the 
day of June, as the poet had it, for the last verse of 
song was : 

" We arrived at Denver City on the 21st of June, 

The people were surprised to see us there so soon, 
But we are good bully whackers. 
We go it on the principle of ' root hog, or die'." 

And the people were surprised indeed, to see us there a 
all, because two nights before we had arrived there had been 
a most fearful panic imaginable caused by the murder o 
the Ilungate family of Itunning Water, and reports com 
ing into Denver that the city was to be taken by the Indians 
that all the Indians of the plains were moving on Denver 
and there was a panic. Only strong, able-bodied men, men 
who were ready to whip Jeff Davis when they might see 
him, they would wilt and hide themselves. And they wer 
surprised to see us coming in because they supposed every 
body on the plains was killed. There was great danger, 
made five trips across the plains. After having enlisted in 
l^'ll, at the outbreak of the Indian war, — Cheyenne War 
in which Colonel S. distinguished or extinguished him 
self, — just the same here to-night; — it was necessary to ope 
up communication again with the States, and I enlisted in 
a regiment. We were then all under martial law, and when 
we had dealt with them at Sandy Creek, the way was clea 
and the fort was taken. And in September I started with a 
si&lt; k minister, a pastor of the first Baptist church ever organ 
izod in that country, took him to Atchison, Kan., because 
that was the nearest railroad station ; he was dying of con 
sumption. He went home to his native city of Providence 
R. I. Coming back I loaded with onions, because I had observed 
that onions were worth thirty cents a pound in Den 
ver, and anybody could see, at least any greenhorn could 
that that was just the thing to load with. When I got down

to the river — I didn't think of the number of onions that 
illicit go in; — I loaded with onions at Atchison, Kan., paying 
a dollar and a half a bushel. I sold then in the spring 
in Denver and got fifteen cents a bushel. I eame out so far 
behind that 1 never tried to Igore it out; I just tried to pay 
my debts the best I could. In all this experience across the 
plains there came a time — in fact it was true after the war 
of LM4, — when we wanted to pass Kearney going west, &lt;&gt;r 
Cat-OS Junction, going east, it was necessary to organize 
into military companies, having a regular military organization 
under the command and the direction of a military 
com wander at these posts. At every military post we were 
halted and counted, and we had to have one hundred men 
and sixty wagons before we were allowed to puss, and these 
were organised by the election of officers, a regular guard 
was kept just as regular as in any military organization. 1 
think one reason that I am not any taller is that I got a fewinches 
of my height frightened out of me during thoat 
days. I had just been elected lieutenant of our company 
going down, and they all were as brave men as I ever saw. 
We walked on ahead, the captain and I, of our company, — 
and we were the otlicers of it, — and nothing on but our big 
navies, and when we got about three miles east of Cottonwood 
Springs, came to a short canyon going down. We had 
to go down the bank and then turn down and find a wayout. 
We just followed the road in the middle of the canyon. 
We met — horrors! Three big Indians. Armed?" I guess 
they were armed, too. There we were, and no wonder I never 
grew any more. I was only nineteen then. Well, we lived 
through it. We found that they were scouts that belonged 
to the post [laughter]. I says, "My, if I was ever scared 
in my life, that was the time," and he said he was. I thought 
he was calm. There was times that it was enough to scare 
men, as I wrote to the secretary. We came to Elm Creek. 
I think it is just opposite of where Lexington is now. We 
found the remains — in the fall of 'G3 going back, — smoking </seg>

piles of shelled corn lying with a trainload of corn that 
had been burned, and the men, all of them, being killed. And 
MM other freighters had been there just before us and they 
buried these, and the ground was yet stained with the blood 
.if the men that had been buried there. The blood was there 
— hadn't yet dried on the ground, and there were times 
indeed that tried men's souls, and a braver seems to me 
never banded together than those men organized in that way 
to brave the dangers of the plains. When the Boers whip 
the English, and God speed the day [applause], we will 
Call them great. But I believe the men who conquered Nebraska, 
the virgin soil of Nebraska, and the men who braved 
the plains in these early days will stand just one notch 
higher than the Boers for bravery and courage. 

Looking at this building to-night I was reminded of the 
way we used to make a corral. We traveled sometimes, and 
it would have been better if we had always done so, double 
tile; two teams abreast, because the road was wide enough, 
wider than any city street all the way from the Missouri 
to Denver on any of these roads. The wagon master would 
simply ride out and take his place, or captain if it was under 
our organization, take his place; one-half of the men would 
start out at a proper place and make a semi-circle, going 
around just opposite of the captain; and the other half 
going around in the Opposite direction, and make pretty 
near a circle. The front wheel of the second wagon, the inner 
front wheel of the second wagon, would come up to about 
eight inches or a foot of the off hind wheel of the first 
wagon, and so on. 

I k.fter we had become a little civilized in the matter we 
rued to make a very beautiful corral, and it was quite 
efense, and in time of attack, as many brave men found 
most helpful as a defense. In time of danger when we 
e threatened, as often we were, with an attack from the 
liana, why we had everything inside of the corral, all of 
stock inside, every man inside, and of course we had </seg>

Ie an improvised fort there every night. Of course I nee&lt; 
talk at any length. I have said that these freighters 
e very brave men, and they were honest men, too, bu 
• would steal [laughter]. I never saw one that wouldn' 
1 a warm bed from a steer, in October. You see a stee 
* by and you would stand around there; if a steer woul&lt; 
still and let you lie down by his side, you would let him 
', but if not you would drive him out and cuddle up i 
place. I believe there was no better natural road o 
li than the road from the Missouri river to Denver 
ongfa it had its bad places. It was the best natural roa&lt; 
the length of it, it seems to me. 

I thought when Mr. Anderson was speaking about the 
dangers through which these freighters had passed, "true 
cn&lt; mgh, it is surprising that we are any of us freighters 
here to-night, and have any hair left at all to-night" [laugh- </seg>

FREIGHTING AND STAGING IN EARLY DAYS. 

Jay A. Barrett, Esq., Librarian, Lincoln, Neb.: 

rJEAR Sm : — I have your favor of July 17, 1899, in regard 
early times iii Nebraska and will try to give you an Mm 
some of the experiences of an early settler. 

I! left St. Louis, Mo., in February, 1859, and came t 
braska City by stage coach from St. Joseph, Mo. The ic 
ng too soft to bear the weight of the coach, the passen 
¦a walked across the river from the Iowa side. The firs 
¦son I met after crossing the river was a Mr. John Irwin 
ter known as "Uncle .Johnny." doing on up to the town 
ound my friend, S. F. Nuckolls, the founder of the city 
1 at the same time met the Hon. J. Sterling Morton am 
v. S. W. Black. At that date the governor, judge, am 
irly all the other territorial officers lived in Nebrask 
;y. The office of the surveyor-general, as well as that o 
&gt; United States quartermaster, Captain Dickerson, were 
o located there, and all the government freight for th 
rts on the plains started from that point under contrac 
th Alexander Majors, successor to the freighting firm o 
ssell, Majors &amp; Waddell. 

In 1857 the original firm had the contract to transport 
supplies for General Johnston's expedition to Utah. 
; contract price for transportation of supplies from the 
isouri river to Camp Fillmore, Utah, was nineteen and 
ee-fourths cents per pound. In 1858-59 the government 
tract for transportation to the western posts, Fort Lara- 
I being the distributing point, was ?1.06 per hundredght, 
or about $6.36 per 100 pounds from the river to the 
t. The rate to mountain points was still higher, but the 
iplies were usually carried to these posts by government 
ins, from Fort Laramie or Fort Union, N. M.

Ie of the Platte river valley with long trains of emigrants,

o kept supplies for the pilgrims. If I remember correctly, 
• first persons who returned from the Pike's Peak, or 
erry Creek, mines were Dr. Mathews and Martin Boui, 
who brought back some very small samples of gold 
3t. That country was then known as Jefferson county, 
nsas, of which I think Golden City was the county seat, 
uit is now known as Denver was originally called 
raria, and was situated on the west bank of Cherry creek. 
1862 we transported private freight, principally flour 
1 bacon, to Denver, at prices reaching as low as live cents 
• pound. The greater part of the supplies for the minis, 
vever, went to Black Hawk and Central City, Cola, as 
irly all the mines were situated in (lilpin county. 

I Times were very hard in the winter of 18(11-02 in Nebraska. 
. Louis, the only market for farm produce, could not be 
nched by boat, the river having frozen, and in consequence 
m went begging On the streets at eight and ten, and wheat 
twenty-five cents per bushel. Cattle and hogs sold as low 
one and a half cents per pound. But all kinds of goods, 
gar, coffee, dry goods, boots, shoes, and general supplies, 
¦adily increased in price until in 1863 coffee, green Rio 
a quality quoted now at seven and a half cents, was sold 
forty cents a pound, and domestic, now sold for five or 
: cents, brought fifty cents per yard. We paid freight 
supplies from St. Louis to St. Joseph either by boat or 
ilroad, and from thence to Nebraska City, at a rate avering 
$1 per 100 pounds; but during low water and late 
the fall I have known freights to reach as high as $4 for 
hundred pounds, delivered either at Nebraska City or 

The Indian war of 1803 and 1884, known as the Ued Cloud 
war. started business to booming again, for the government 
was sending troops and supplies to all parts of the plains, 
and freighters had plenty of contracts at high figures, the </seg>

Fort Laramie, and from twelve to fourteen cents per 
nd to Fort Halleck and Fort Sanders. 

Iliese prices continued until the building of the Unio 
ific railroad, which reached Kearney in the fall of 1 !&gt;!'¦» 
next vear the government freight and all other freigh 
¦hipped by rail to the town of North Platte, Neb., an 
11 then forwarded by wagons, which tended to redut 
rate. As the railroad lengthened the wagon routes 
e correspondingly shortened. In the fall the road ha 
lied Julesburg, and a little later Cheyenne was the ter 
us, so that bj the winter of 18G7-68 the freighting bus 
i had practically ended. The Union Pacific, however 
I kept up a pretty stiff rate for railroad freight. 

in the summer of 18GG I transported three hundred thouid 
pounds, of freight from Nebraska City to Salt Lake 
y at eighteen cents per pound. We had a contract at Fort 
•amie in 18G5 for corn at $7.50 per bushel. Corn, which 
s brought in part from St. Louis, cost that year at Neska 
City $1.50 per bushel, that leaving us about eleven 
ts per pound for transportation. Corn sold in Denver at 
eea cents a pound and flour at $20 for a bag weighing 
lety-eight pounds. 

I The rates for transportation of passengers were at as high 
figure as those for freight. The Overland Stage Company 
1863 charged $75 fare to Denver and $150 to Salt Lake 
ty, while in 18G6 they got the price up to $150 to Denver 
d $350 to Salt Lake City. The baggage of each passenger 
is limited to twenty-five pounds and there was a charge 
$3 for every extra pound. At $1 each, meals, consisting 
bacon, bread, and coffee, with sometimes game, such as 
nison, antelope, or occasionally a sage hen, could be 
tained. Butter and eggs were unknown luxuries at stage 
itions, the former selling in Denver at $1.50 per pound 
Ld the latter at the same price per dozen.

FREIGHTING IN THE '60s. 

rritten for the January, 1900, meeting of the Nebraska State Historical 
Society, by Herman Robert Lyon, of Glen wood, Iowa. 

When I see the through freights steaming past on their 
way to Denver, the ''liver" and fast mail speeding at a terrific 
rate over the solid "Q" road, I am forced to admit that 
thej best the ox teams and big wagons and the "mule-backs' 7 
that had a corner on the business in the 'COs. 

I My first trip across tlfl plains was made in 18G2. We 
irtt'd October 8 (my birthday), with ten loads of shelled 
rn for the government, and were bound for Fort Laramie, 
yo. We crossed the Missouri river at Plattsmouth and 
uled at Nebraska City. 

I Moses Stocking of Ashland, Neb., was wagon boss. The 
musters were John and Andrew Tutt, John Daugherty, 
iillie' 1 Donnelly, Johnse and Fete Tysen, Marion Bomar, 
fellow from Missouri (have forgotten his name), Joshua 
xlenheiiner, and I. We were paid |25 and board per 

The roads were pretty good most of the way. Crossing th 
South Platte, at Julesburg, Col., and going through the 
sand-hills we had to put seven or eight yoke of oxen to a 
wagon, which made progress pretty slow for a few miles 
(•&lt;•&lt; asionally. On this trip we went about twelve miles a 

Et Julesburg we got sight of the Rockies, and although 
hundred miles off, the exposure gave several of us a 
re attack of "mountain fever." 

Efu route was mostly along the South Platte to Jules- 
K, then we struck northwest, going through the old vil; 
of Lodge Pole, to the North Platte. </seg>

            <seg id="p267">
266 

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

Ely going this way we had plenty of water for the oxen 
I avoided the alkali districts, although on the stretch 
ween Julesburg and the North Platte, near Court House 
k, we had to go nearly forty miles without water. 

r\Ve forded Salt creek at Ashland, the old trail leading 
¦boot where the dam for the electric light plant now is. 

Il'he tirst storm struck us when we were about twent 
es east of Fort Kearney. It was a fearful blizzard an&lt; 
uished an experience that none of us cared to ha\ 
icated. A terrific northwester, with blinding snow, mac 
M and warm meals impossible, especially when the fue 
isisted of dried buffalo and cattle droppings gatheret 
n;j; the way and thrown into sjy.'ks provided on the sidi 
the wagons. I tell you we felt glad to see old Kearne 
ming up when we got to jogging westward again. 

Cactus had been troublesome along the way, but beyond 
Port Kearney our camping grounds were not a bed of rose3 

tr, if they were, sure enough, your honor, the roses had 
n plucked and nothing left but the stickers. The oxen, 
, suffered much discomfort, for often they had "panes" 
sticking to their sides when they got up. 

t never see cactus plants of the spined variety but what 
ink if owners of the sticky things had crossed the 
us by ox team in the 'COs there wouldn't be much love 
in their hearts for the cactus tribe. 

Ely wife had the cactus craze (she did not cross the 
ins), and when her collection, for which I could not get 
the slightest enthusiasm, froze last winter, I fear my 
ret was neither deep nor sincere. 

Slocking, the wagon boss, rode an old mule and alwa\ 
went ahead to find a camping place, then rode back to th 
trail to conduct us to it. At night we made a corral for th 
cattle, took all possible precaution against a stampede, an&lt; 
kept a picket out to watch for Indians. The Indians wet 
very friendly along the way, on this trip, but their approac 
was liable to stampede the cattle. </seg>

FBEIGHTIXG IN THE '60s. 

The two days out from Tort Kearney were hard ones and 
we were tired enough when we went into camp the second 
night. I always slept leaning against one of the oxen; the 
creature was warm, a condition not to be overlooked during 
cold weather on the bleak plains. Then, in case of a staiupede 
I would awaken when the ox got up. On this night, 
however, I was dead asleep and slipped to the ground without 
awakening when the ox got up. What did waken me 
I never knew, but have always believed it was the hand of 
Providence, for when I opened my eyes a large gray wolf 
was standing not more than a dozen feet from me. There 
was no mistaking the creature's identity, for I had met His 
Majesty on previous occasions in Michigan and Illinois. I 
could feel my hair raise, and it went up quicker than a silk 
umbrella, too. I had no gun, not even a pocket-knife. I 
grabbed my hat, flourished it wildly about, and yelled at 
the top of my voice. Frightened at the sudden action and 
the noise, the creature fled. I was not slow in getting out 
of that and looking up my oxen. 

I There was sufficient game along the Platte that the wolf 
uld not have been very hungry; if he had been I doubt if 
hat would have stood in the way of a coveted meal. 

{'. am certain that our crowd never forgot their introducq 
to Julesburg, Col. We stajed there one night and put 
the next day crossing the South Platte. We put seven or 
lit yoke of cattle on each wagon, and four of us had to 
de across with each load. 

I The mush-ice was thick, and the chunks of floating ice 
ten struck us with such force that it nearly knocked us 
wn. We were wet to the armpits, and after wading the 
rer nine tinfes I must admit that I was dead tired, ready 
r supper and a seat close to the fire. 

We got on very peaceably until we got to Pole creek, between 
Julesburg and the North Platte; then two of the 
drivers got into a dispute and finally indulged in a little 
physical exercise. I was not on the grounds at the time, </seg>

and there were several stories about the affair, which arose 
over the question of herding the cattle. In speaking of the 
affair afterward we always referred to it as the "Battle of 
Pole Creek." 

One of the high bluffs along the North Platte, just before 
wi' reached the Wyoming line, was covered about ten feet 
deep and about eighteen or twenty feet around with buffalo 
bones and beads. The scores of heads with the large black 
horns was a sight I shall never forget, and I imagine there 
was a "rattling of dry bones'" when the top of that bluff was 

We were told that a famous chief had been buried there, 
and I have often thought of the amount of labor that monument 
of bones represented. I imagine I could almost see 
the poor old squaws trudging along many weary miles, 
through snow or rain or the blazing sun and toiling up the 
steep bluff, dragging a head to add to the pile. 

After unloading at Fort Laramie we all went to Denver. 
Those who wanted to stay got their discharge and pay and the 
others returned with the teams. The fellow from Missouri, 
Jnhu Tysen, Joshua Bodenheiuier, and I remained. 

Bodeaheimer was a printer and struck a job on the Rocky 
ountdin Xcirtt. The last I heard of him he was running 
le Carthage (Mo.) Pnett. John Tutt is in the mercantile 
msiness in lMattsmouth, Neb. Marion Iiomar is living in 
issouri; do not remember his address. These are all of the 
niginal ten" that I know to be living. Billie Donnelly died 
n (lien wood, la., about ten years ago, from the effects of an 
nputation of a foot. 

t There was a bridge in process of construction across the 
atte at Denver, and I got a job there at $3 per day, and 
&gt;rked about one month. 

As my occupation, previous to freighting, had been soldiering 
and lying sick from typhoid fever in Mississippi and 
Tennessee, it seemed to me that the winter of 18G2-63 was 
the coldest winter on record. </seg>

In January, 1863, 1 went to Central City where I remained 
till 18(54. I ran an engine in P. D. Casey's quartz mill, and 
tended plates in Armour's mill. 

On January 15, 18C4, 1 started for Pana, 111., to claim "the 
girl I left behind." 

I went as far as Omaha by mule team. We saw a good 
ny dead cattle along the way — in fact, almost whole trains 
cattle froze that winter. 

When we reached IJawhide creek an Indian came up to ou 
wagoa; he was friendly, shook hands, told us his name \va 
George and that he belonged to the Pawnee tribe. He said 
he was hungry and wanted some tobacco. I gave him som 
bread, meat, smoking tobacco, and a little coffee. 

IMie incident that furnished a name for this creek also 
led a page to state history. A party of 'Hen (though it 
&gt;pened to be in 1850), were near the little stream. One of 
party who had a gun but had failed to find any game 
lared he would shoot the first live thing he saw. As they 
clied the stream he saw a squaw sitting ou a stump or log 
the bank, and, carrying his threat into execution, he shot 
. A party of Indians soon found the dead squaw and made 
pursuit of the whites, whom they overtook at a short disu 
e and demanded the man who had done the shooting. 
tj at first refused to give him up, but as the Indians 
eatened to kill the whole party if he was not surrendered, 
1 they did not approve the action anyway, the guilty one 
s delivered to the enraged red men, who took him back to 
ere the squaw was shot and skinned him alive. 

I started on my second trip in May, 18(56, I made this trip 
alone with my own outfit. While on my first trip I had taken 
note of what was most wanted and would be most appreciated 
along the route. I had a large, strong horse team and piled 
on all the load I thought they would pull, to start with. 

t.My load consisted of butter, sugar, coffee, tea, eggs, cabge, 
cookies, tomato catsup, and pickles. I went as far as 
•rt Cottonwood and averaged about |6 a day net profit on 
e round trip. </seg>

            <seg id="p271">

The catsup I sold at fifty cents a small bottle, cucumbe 
pickles I sold ;it seventy -five cents a dozen, or §10 a twenty 
fve-pound powder keg full. A few bushels of good sized cook 
ics went at two cents each. The butter had to go first, as th 
increasing warm weather did not improve the flavor. I coul 
have realized a better profit if I had been able to get it t 
Fort Cottonwood in good condition. 

About thirty miles east of Port Kearney I ¦topped at 
ranch, and as my team was used to standing, I did not ti 
them. I stepped into a back room where several were seate 
at a table eating, when my team started. There was a chilt 
about three years old standing between me and the door, 
jumped over the child, down and out of the door, and su&lt; 
reeded in stopping my team by the time it had gotten abou 
thirty reds from the ranch house. I believe this was the fast 
est ¦printing I ever did. 

\\ lien I got the team back I found two Indians there, and 
it did not take me long to guess what had Stampeded the 
horses. One of the Indians was the Pawnee I had met at 
liauhidc creek; he knew me and spoke of the previous meeting 
in very good English. 

ILbont six years after I met "Pawnee George" a third time 
e Sunday afternoon I was sitting by a front parlor win 
v reading a book, when my eldest daughter climbed o 
back of my chair and whispered in my ear that an India 
; standing at the gate. I looked out and saw a red mat 
arms folded, leaning against the gate and gazing intent! 
me. I put down the book and walked out to where h 
[)d. He was most cordial in his greeting, shook hand- 
I wanted to see my '"squaw"' and "pappooaea." I invite* 
1 in, and my wife gave him some lunch. All Indians loo 
ce to me and I did not recognize the Pawnee until h 
erred to our previous meetin_

would not let a small train leave, so I had to stay until forty 
wagOM were going my way. We kept sentries out every 
night and took all possible precaution against stampede. 

At Port Cottonwood some drunken, boisterous soldiers 
were having a regular "shindy" and some of them were 
already in trouble. They were too badly intoxicated to know 
who came or went, and realizing that they would offer no 
protection should the fort be attacked, and fearing the foe 
less than the friends, I left Fort Cottonwood without escort 
and drove twelve miles that night. I will not deny that they 
were anxious miles. I reached Fort Kearney in due time 
without seeing any Indians. 

At Fort Kearney I got in with seventeen teams coming 
homeward; one had come through from California. We met 
the Californian with his wife and three or four children, on 
the 3d of July. The next day, to celejbrate, he treated his 
family and myself to California wine. 

My route on this trip was along the South Platte most of 
the way. I crossed the Missouri river on the Plattsmouth 
ferry and Bait creek at the old Ashland ford. The roads were 
pretty good most of the way. 

I rested my team a few days, got my "cargo'' together, and 
sta: '.&lt; (1 en a third trip "on my own hook," in July, 1SG6. My 
load consisted of tinware, groceries, and a good lot of eggs. 

The reads were fairly good on this trip, but as I did not 
clear more than $2.50 to $3 per day I turned my attention 
to other occupations nearer home. 

The Indian troubles had reached their height about this 
time and freighters were liable to be detained at ranches or 
forts — if they escaped being scalped. 

Between Fort Kearney and Fort Cottonwood we went out 
from the river three or four miles. The road was a little better, 
and we found it was greatly to our advantage that we 
did so. for looking to the south of us we could see cattle 
stampeding about three miles off. We knew it to be a signal 
that Indians were near and hustled to get our stock into </seg>

When I reached Plattsmouth on my return trip I found 
the river higher than it had been for years. The ferry took 
us away above Plattsmouth, unloaded us on a high point of 
ground, and we had to go through water for five miles. Part 
of the wav it was up in the wagon box. 

I have a gentle reminder of old freighting times, occasion

me a little on freight rates. When I speak of it before m,

THE PLAINS WAR IN 1865 

Written for January, 1900, meeting of Nebraska State Historical Society by 

C. B. Hadley, Nehawka, Neb 

It was on the 15th of October, 1862, that a small party o 
us left Andrews county, Missouri, lor Dearer, our wagon 
loaded with apples and drawn by axes. I was a young man a 
that time and had but #63 to begin business, so went as par 
ner with one Dick Uixler. We bought us a cheap team an 
wagon, everything being very cheap, and engaged to hau 
apples by the hundred. We crossed the Missouri river b 
ferry at St. Joe. Everything went smoothly for two or tint 
days, when we woke up one morning to find our cattle ha 
all been driven oft in the night by the Indians, but we wei 
so fortunate as to recover them without trouble. We arrive 
at Marysville, Kan., on the evening of the 24th, and eampet 
on a hill west of town. The weather had been warm and dt 
lightful, but a cold wave came down in the night and con 
tinued two days, freezing our apples slightly. The rest o 
our trip was uneventful, the weather as a rule being fine, bu 
occasionally a northerner would come swooping down am 
rain sand in our faces to a fearful extent. It was my firs 
trip across the plains, and to say it was a grand success 
would be putting it mild. We arrived in Denver the 23d o 
November, to find the market glutted with apples, selling fo 
about $4 per bushel, and everything else selling in propor 
tion. We made two trips from St. Joe to Denver, makiu 
but little more than expenses. We then dissolved partner 
ship. 

In regard to the roads would say they were generally good, 
except in the spring and early summer; then the alkali lands 
were bad. Of bridges we had none after we left the Neinaha 
in Nebraska, having to ford all the streams, the worst roads 
being the sandhills between old Julesburg and Upper Junc-

tion. But in 'G3 McCoy got a charter to build bridges over 
the sand with litter from the ranches and stage stations. They 
i lieu hauled sod and spread over the litter. I was employed 
mi the works about three months. I did first rate on the toll 
ruad — cleared enough money to buy a first-class team. Then 
I went to freighting from Missouri to Council Bluffs and 
Omaha, clearing about $150 per month, and continued until 
the winter of "Ci. When the news came to Savannah the last 
(if December, telling of the Indians burning the ranches and 
killing the ranchmen, killing the freighters, destroying their 
Is, driving off their teams, and burning their freight wagons, 
I knew then if a man could get to Denver with a loa&lt; 
i if apples he would make a big thing, and lots of excitemei 
besides. So I bought a light three-inch wagon. I had a span ( 
young, fast mules. I loaded apples after lining the box wit 
paper, packed the apples in bran, and started the 7th day &lt; 
January, 18G3, crossed the Missouri river on the ice at N&lt; 
luaska City on the 12th, got to Fort Kearney the 17th. IIa\ 
ing gone that far alone, I stopped there four days waiting fo 
a train to collect, for the Indians were doing depredations 
all along the road. During my stay .there a small train of 
empty wagons came in. They had had a running fight with 
the Indians; one of the men came in with a broken arm, but 
In- still clung to the lines. During the four days fifty wagons 
or more had gathered, so I was ready to start on my most 
exciting trip. The train pulled out of Fort Kearney the 
morning of the 22d of January, 18G5. We found the freight 
mad almost swept of forage. I was traveling with a horse 
and mule train. We had to have hay or grass. The Indians 
were so dangerous we could not depend on the range for 
grass, most of the hay was burned, and the ranches destroyed. 
But the government finally established small military posts 
about every fifty miles, and at the stations we always found 
plenty of hay at five and six cents a pound. Sometimes it 
was fresh hay. When I say "fresh'' I mean it was cut in the 
winter after the grass was all dead. But we were glad to get 
it, and as for grain, most every train hauled enough for them- </seg>

selves. We readied old Julesburg, February 2. The military 
post was one mile west. The commander at the fort gave us 
orders to stop. We corralled our wagons about one hundred 
yards northeast of the post. The Indians had burned Ackley's 
ranch and Fosters train of seventeen wagons nine miles 
above Julesburg three days before we arrived, and were still 
having a good time over the luxuries they had captured, for 
the train was loaded with groceries. The Ackley ranchmen 
and Foster and his men, after a hard fight with the Indians, 
had made their escape to the military post, and let the redskins 
have their train. Next morning our horses and mules 
needed hay. There was plenty of hay at Conly &amp; Bulen's 
ranch, one mile east of Julesburg, which made it two miles 
from our corral. Conly at that time was in Nebraska City, 
but Bulen was at the military post. Bulon hitched up two 
teams to haul the hay to our corral. There were only twenty 
null who had the sand to go with him after the hay, and I 
was one of them. I rude one of my fast mules, and she would 
have to show her wind and strength before we returned. We 
took ropes with us to bind the hay in bundles; we paid six 
cents per pound. I bought fifty pounds. I then got on one of 
the wagons to load the hay. My bundle was the first on the 
wagon, but before the hay was loaded Bulen got on his horse 
and made for the post. The men dropped out of the hay 
corral one by one until there were none left but myself and 
one other man, who was helping me load. My mule was tie&lt; 
to the corral fence and was charging to go, for she smellex 
danger. I said to him, "Let's get out of this. Don't you hea 
guns firing and the red devils yelling on the other side of th 
military post?" "Do you think we can ever reach the corra 
in time to save our scalps?" "Well, hardly, so here goes for 
two-mile stretch." My mule, Kate was her name, she fairl 
flew over the ground, landed me in the corral in time for 
me to get my gun and help fight the Indians to keep them off 
of Bill and a few more who had fallen behind.

heavy wagons, heavily loaded with groceries, and an extr 
wagon to haul their grab outfit. Be was one of the hay part, 
a man who was always alive to any kind of business or enie 
gency, and after every man had got into the corral and gi 
his gu, Demmick said, "We are going to fi^ht Indians to tl 
death and to save our teams and wagons. If there are an 
here who can't stand tire, let them go crawl in their wagOM 
None crawled in. There were a lot of cedar lo&lt;;s close to tl

There were between four and live hundred. The sieije com

II will not say any more about the raid because I think 
ere will be men at the meeting who know as much about 
as I do, for all I know is what I saw and perhaps I could 
t sec as far as others. The scene was grand and sublime 
say the least. The day was clear and bright, no wind to 
terfere with the view of the whole proceeding. It beat anyins 
I have ever seen.

inigh to feed my team to Denver. I sold about $25 worth as 
m as I got it into the corral; sold the balance on the road 
Denver. On the 5th we pulled out for Denver. We found 
klcy'.s ranch still smoking and the remains of Fosters

We 'i;i&lt;1 ¦ u tod trip from there on to Denver. The Indians 
had ali gone because they had their windup at Julesburg, 
ck.ss. .1 tin- river, and went north. Apples were a pretty good 
price, about $20 per bushel or fl.50 per dozen. I did pretty 
well on them. Everybodj made money except the corn-haulers. 
It was too heavy to haul so far, for the price paid for 
it. I started back to the States in due time, gathering up six 
passengers for Nebraaka City. Got $210 for the trip, so I 
could not help make some money, besides lota of fun. I reached 
Nebraska City the 12th of March. We had a terrible snowstorm 
on the trip, back in Colorado, about eighty miles this 
side of Denver. About two feet of snow fell during the night. 
Men sleeping on the ground were in a fix. One man said he 
lust $100 in a snowbank and could not find it. In regard to 
the freighters' ups and downs, their stock in trade, etc., 
parties who bought their teams and wagons, at say $58 to 
$63, then sold out when wagons were from $200 to #250 and 
mules from $400 to $600 per span, oxen from $150 to $200 
per span. Now suppose these parties made a trip in the 
winter of 1864-65 and got $25 per hundred to haul freight to 
l&gt;«nver, then sold their outfit at the top prices — they were 
the ones who made money. But the party who bought the 
high priced outfits were completely swamped, because the 
fall in the price of teams and wagons began in '65, and down 
went freighting from twenty-five cents to twelve and one-half 
cents per pound, and dragged wagons and stock down about 
40 per cent., and a great many parties were completely 
raised. I know of three young men who blew in at \&lt; 
$15,000 in about two years. 

KThe few ranchmen who were not burned out made money,

tary i'&lt;&gt;sts aliout every fifty miles between Fort Kearney an&lt; 
the upper junction, so the ranchmen at these points were i 
luck. A ranch well stocked and a business-like man to ru 
it could make thousands of dollars. The ranchman at th 
upper junction told me in November, 1S(»3, that be bad mat 
about |25,000 that year. The soldiers blew in most of the 
pay at the bar. Whisky sold for fifty cents per giass durin 
the Indian war, canned fruit $1.50 per can, and every thin 
in proportion. I went through with two loads of apples 
amount ing to 100 bushels in the fall of '•;."&gt;. I got about ?1 
per bushel for them, and it was the last trip I made to Den 
vcr. It bad been one of the most disagreeable trips I eve 
made. The Indians bad broken out again on a small seal 
and they would harass the freighters after night, drive off th 
stuck, and now and then kill a herder. 

My teams were one heavy wagon with three yoke of oxe 
and a (icrmau driver, my faithful mules with a light wago 
and myself to drive them, but I finally got tired travelin 
llow, so I left my ox team in care of a man who bad 
large ox train. I left them between Fort Kearney and Co 
tonwomL I then traveled with a mule train after I hac 
traveled fifteen or twenty miles to overtake the train, am 
after I had got to Denver and unloaded a telegram earn 
to the parties who owned the ox train that I had left m

tie. so of course I expected that my oxen were gone also, 
started back to see about my outfit. I came about one hun 
died and twenty five miles and met my driver with the teai 
all right. I then divided the load and went back to Denver 
As soon as I could I disposed of the ox outfit and swore 
would never own another ox as long as I lived, and 1 hav

OVERLAND FREIGHTING FROM NEBRASKA CITY. 

OVERLAND FREIGHTING FROM NEBRASKA CITY. 

ren for the annual meeting of the Nebraska State Historical Society. 
January 10, 1900, by Hon. D. P. Rolfe, Nebraska City. 

In September, 1860, the writer sold his profitable interest 
in business located on Fourth street in the city of St. Louh, 
having decided to make a second flight from New York towards 
the setting sun, Nebraska City having been the place 
selected for his resting place. 

Pi purchased a good stock of groceries and outfitting 
s, suitable for the wants of the plains trade, and ikipped 
, by steamboat, for Nebraska City, 714 miles up the .Misriver 
from St. Louis, paying freight at the rate of $2.25 
lundred pounds. 

I He landed here on the 15th of October, I860. Having a 
)re room already prepared, located in Kearney (now a part 
Nebraska City ) , he was soon in shape to supply the wants 
the overland business with such supplies as were needed 
r making the long trip to Denver, Salt Lake, and military 
sts. 

I Nebraska City at that time was considered, the most favorle 
point on the Missouri river for the transportation of 
?ight to the far western points. It was the headquarters 
r the great company of Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell, who 
?ighted nearly all tfce government supplies destined to miliry 
posts from the Missouri river to Salt Lake. 

K Nearly all other than government freight was carried by 
lighting firms and individual parties. 

THE GREAT FIRE 

IOn the 12th of May, I860, previous to my arrival, there 
curred a disastrous fire in Nebraska City, destroying nearly </seg>

all the business part of the town north from Table creek, th 
only business linns left being Hawke &amp; Nuckolls, bit wee 
:»il and 4th on Main street, and Robert Heffley, on the cornt 
of 9th and Main. During the years of 18G0 and "01 the greate 
part of the business of the city was clone in Kearney, betwcc 
North Table creek and the levee, but after that time, as th 
city rebuilt its burned district, the business gradually movex 
back t:) its old quarter*, and then extended farther west. 

E'lie business &lt;;f the "wild and ¦woolly"' little town (called 
?) on the extreme borders of civilization depended for 
rapport almost entirely upon the transportation of freight 
tward. 

It was then considered the only business that would build 
up our town and add value to its near vicinity, as it was the 
general opinion that the country a few miles west from the 
Missouri river border was valueless for agricultural purposes. 
With that idea nearly every business man was ready 
to do all in his power to advance the interests of Nebraska 
City as a freighting point. 

Till: OLD CALIFORNIA TRAIL. 

I Previous to the year of 1861 all western freight foled 
the old California trail, running northwest from Meska 
City, striking the Platte river thirty miles from its 
uth, then following up the Platte, running north, making 
ig bend around what is now the counties of Saunders, But, 
and Polk. A few of the busim ss men of Nebraska City 
ided it would advance the business of our city if the old 
ite could be shortened between Nebraska City and Fort 
aniey. With that object in view, they mot and agreed 
it, if possible, the route should be shortened. William E. 
II was chosen as the one who should go over the country 
1 locate the route on as nearly a direct east and west line 
possible from Nebraska City to Fort Kearney. An outfit 
s made ready, anil Mr. II ill started on his exploring expeion. 
Upon his return he reported that a good route had </seg>

for an early breakfast ; then would come the time for a pood 
smoke, song, and story; then rolling up in their blankets to 
rest under the wagons until "Koll out! Roll out!" is called 
out at daybreak by the night herder. After an early breakfast 
the cattle are driven in the corral and at the command 
"Yoke up!" every driver starts in among the cattle with yoke 
on his left shoulder, ox-bow in his right hand, and key in his 
mouth, looking for his off-wheeler. When found, the yoke is 
fastened to him with one end resting on the ground until the 
near one, his mate, is found. When yoked together they are 
taken to the wagon and hitched in their place; then come the 
others in their order, only a short time being required until

a small point and tipped with a buckskin popper, hung to a 
handle eighteen inches in length, filling both hands in its 
grasp but small at the end; four or five swings over and 
around the head the lash is shot straight out with the report 
of a gun. With twenty-six of these whips swinging at the 
same time, the reports sound like the fire of a picket line of 
soldiers. A steer was seldom struck with these whips, unless 
a deadhead. When hit with full force blood would surely

slowly and quietly around them during the night, gentl

INCIDENTS OF THE ROUTE. 

En the early spring of 1802 I purchased an outfit — any 
niter of teams and wagons less than a full train was called 
outfit — loaded the wagona with nj own merchandise for 
Denver market. I was one of the first to pull out from 
naska City that season. 

On the route, a few miles west from Fort Kearney, « 
struck a vast herd of buffalo that was making for the Platt 
for water. They were in such numbers that we made cam 
thinking it not best to drive through them. These wild ca 
tie were a part of the yearly drift from North to South dow 
the 1'latte, crossing the country from that point to the R 
publican river, it being the nearest point between the tw 

The next day, while in camp, a small war party of Sioux 
Indians, in their war paint, stopped with us for dinner. They 
were on their way to join a large force for a fight with the 
Pawnees. The Sioux, from their earliest history, were enemies 
of the Pawnees on the south and to the Utes on the west. 
On our return trip we met a few of this same party on foot, 
on their return from their conflict, having lost several of 
their warriors and a number of ponies, but they proudly 
slio wed two Pawnee scalps they had taken.

was a little city of tents and cheaply built wood buildings 
on the business street. I think there was but one brick building, 
that a warehouse bekmgiag to the freighting firm of 
Kussell, Majors &amp; Waddell. I closed out my gOOda, realizing 
a food profit. The third day after my arrival, having received 
something over $10,000 in Cherry Creek gold dust, soldered 
up in two-pound oyster cans, rolled up in my blankets and 
¦trapped MCVdj at the back of my saddle, I mounted my 
mule and started to overtake my teams. The second day out, 
when about fifty miles east from Denver, about two o'clock 
on a warm afternoon, I was jogging along on my mule, half 
asleep, when I was suddenly aroused by "Ili-yi-a-IIi-yi-a- 
I le-ye-a-a Hi-yi-llo." Looking up I saw a short distance away, 
coming over a swell on the trail, a war party of Indians 
mounted on fine plains ponies, armed with lance, bows, and 
arrows. They came on a charge, with lame at rest and with 
a quivering feather at the head of every lance. I was quickly 
surrounded by one hundred and fifty greased and painted 
wild beings, with not a thing on or about them that was not 
of native manufacture, adorned with many ornaments made 
from hammered silver. On seeing that wild charge approaching 
I was startled, but the Indians at that time were friendly, 
and I thought they meant me no harm. They were a war 
party of Ogallala Sioux on a raid against their old-time 
1'iny, the Utes. During the interview the chief explained 
sign language how they intended surprising the Utes by 
¦eping on them like snakes, and getting many scalps, 
inging to the horn of my saddle was a fine Colt's navy rever. 
The chief wished to see it. I drew it from the c:isc 
i passed it to him. After giving it a close examination 
passed it to one near him, and from him it went the circle 
all on the inside. Many guttural sounds and motions were 
de while looking it over. Then it came back from hand 
hand to the chief who gave it to me with signs of thanks. 
at same revolver was afterward captured by the Indians, 
il the man who carried it was killed. </seg>

I After entertaining me for half an hour I liberally treated 
use near with tobacco, who received it with many "How 
iws." Then the chief gave a command by a flash from a 
tall round mirror, set in a frame with handle and hung to 
e wrist. In an instant they wheeled into line, starting off 
a lope, striking into their wild war-song : "IIo-a-Hi via 
' ye a Hi -yi-IIo." I sat on my mule and gazed after them 
itil they passed from my sight. The history of this same 
ir party is, the I'tes leaned of their approach, ambushed 
em, fought and defeated them with great loss. It is said 
is was the last war party sent against the Utes by the 
ax, after having been long-time enemies. 

TRANSPORTATION RATES. 

The freighting business increased largely in volume every 
year from 1H52 to 18(6. According to a census taken for the 
year 1865, there were employed in the movement of goods, 
grain, and other stores, westward from Nebraska City: 7,365 
wagons, 7.1':!! mules, f»0,712 oxen, 8,385 men. Transporting 
31.44r&gt;. 12s pounds of freight. 

I The customary rate of cattle freight to any point where 
o trips could be made during the season was $1 per hun- 
Bd pounds for each 1(10 miles; sometimes a little more or 
s, owing to circumstances. Winter rates to Denver were 
mi ten to twelve cents per pound. Salt Lake freight was 
died almost entirely with cattle, as cattle, wagons, and 
S whole paraphernalia of the train had to be sold to the 
unions and California cattle dealers on arrival at desti- 

The established rate to Salt Lake was twenty-five cents per 
pound, although Kussell, Majors &amp; Waddell hauled the government 
freight in large quantities at about twenty cents 
per pound. Kates to other points were based upon the prices 
paid to Denver and Salt Lake. </seg>

for the saving in wagoa transportation, cutting our city off 
from the business that had given it prosperity for a number 
of years. The importance of railroads was then realized. 
Otoe Countv voted bonds to secure an eastern connection, 
but some of our business men considered a western connection 
of more importance, and after a number of meetings of 
the most prominent business men it was deckled that for the 
future prosperity of our city and county, a railroad westward, 
to connect with the Union Pacific .Railroad at or near 
(hand Island, running on a line near the one taken for the 
freighting route, was of vital importance. With that object 
in view, on the 12th of December, 1807. the Midland Pacific 
Railway Company was organized, composed of business men 
of our city as follows: James Sweet, F. A. White, E. S. 
Ilawley. William Fulton, II. S. Calhoun, John B. Bennett. 
TollH-rt Ashton, Nathas Simpson, and R. ML Rolfe. Frank 
A. White was chosen president and R. M. Rolfe secretary. 
Otoe county, at a special election held with only sixty-seven 
against, voted 9150,000 in bonds to be delivered to the com 
panv upon a personal bond for $200,000 being given by the 
company for the faithful expenditure of the proceeds of the 
bonds in constructing and equipping the road. A corps of 
engineers was engaged and the surveying commenced in 
March, 1868. A line was surveyed via Lincoln to Grand 
Island, right of way procured through Otoe County, and contracts 
let for the grading of the first ten miles. From the 
commencement to its completion to Lincoln the work sever 
stopped. 

The building of the Midland Pacific Railway doubled the 
raise of lands in (Hoe County, built up prosperous towns 
long its route, bringing to its connection, at our city, the 
Burlington from Bed Oak, and the iron and steel railroad 
and wagon bridge across the Missouri River.

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

FROM MERIDIAN TO FORT KEARNEY. 

Written by A. J. Croft, Davenp"rt, Neb., for the annnal meeting of the 
Nebraska State Historical Society, January 10, lyOO. 

In 1870 the old overland road known as the Salt Lak 
il was still in use by the early settlers as a wagon roat 
:, owing to the advent of railroads at about this time, 
8 no longer in use by freighters. I speak of that sectio 
the trail lying between Meridian, which is situated in tl 
reme eastern border of Thayer County, or perhaps, mor 
ictly speaking, on the line between Thayer and Jefferso 
inties, and Fort Kearney. This section was a part of tl 
il from St. Joseph, Mo., and Nebraska City, Neb., to Fo 
arney, Jind thence west to Salt Lake City, Utah. Ti 
avenworth and St. Joseph branch united with the N 
iska City branch a few miles from Meridian, and froi 
s junction there was but one trail until Fort Kearne 
s reached. 

Meridian was a general stopping place for freighters, and 
was situated on the Little Blue about two miles from the 
present village of Alexandria. Many of the old log buildings 
still stand on the site, and its neglected little cemetery 
on the hill just above is the resting place of many unfortunate 
victims of gaming table misunderstandings. 

I From here the trail consists of several parallel track 
iking a road from four to ten rods wide and could be see 
r miles as it wound its way along the Little Blue Rive 
le next stop was at Kiowa, where there was a stockade, et 
lis was the last stop in Thayer County. The next statio 
is Spring Ranch, in Clay County, then King's Ranch, o 
lown later as Kingston, in Adams County, nearly south o 
e city of Hastings. From King's Ranch th3 traU con </seg>

Eued westward for but a short distance and then turned 
nearly a northwesterly direction across the divide to the 
t (Kearney). 

t King's Ranch was the last stopping place on the Blue, and 
ranches intervened between it and Fort Kearney. 

Iln 1870-71 this overland route showed signs of recent ser?e, 
and pieces of broken wagons, ox bows, etc., were found 
frequent intervals. Mr. James Lemon, who freighted for 
iny years aloLg this route, tells many thrilling experiences 
th hostile Indians. 

Very little remains at present of the great Salt Lake trail 
but a memory. It has been broken up by the farmer's plow, 
and instead of bearing the freighter's heavy laden wagon it 
bears the heavy laden stalks of grain. </seg>

FREIGHTING REMINISCENCES. 

rn for the annual meeting of the Nebraska State Historical Society, 
January 10, 1'JOO, by Porter Maddox, Box Elder, Neb. 

As one of the lew "old teamsters" in the overland 
freighting business, when the "Wo Haw" was the principal 
engine for moving supplies from the Missouri River to the 
Rockies and over them, and the hair of the white man was in 
great demand among the Sioux and several other tribes of 
Red Men, I of course feel quite an interest in that part of the 
history of our fair state. If it were possible, I should much 
enjoy being with the Old Hoys at your next meeting. It 
seems but a short time since I made my first trip from Nebraska 
City, in 1S(5."&gt;, for Denver, which was but a hamlet 
compared with her present grandeur. Yet even then every 
thing was rush and bustle. Methinks I can see the rusty, 
lousy, dirt-begrimed bull-whacker with from ten to fourteen 
feet of whiplash attached to eighteen or twenty inches of 
polished hickory, and hear them as we passed the eastbound 
empties, when asked where we loaded, answer, "Omaha-haha." 
and if asked where we were headed for, answer, "Idahoho-ho." 
The wages we got for our work were |60 per month 
for driving six to eight yoke of cattle, while the night herder 
gut from ¦*•'»."&gt; to $70 and board. This consisted chiefly of sowbelly, 
beans, sugar, coffee, and tough bread or flap-jacks. 
Yet we were a jolly set of fellows, especially when we had 
the right kind of boss, but it was not always sunshine and 
pleasure. We were often called upon to witness suffering and 
death. While I was on the trail, I visited Denver, Laramie, 
the Powder River via the old North Platte Bridge trail, Salt 
Lake, Ogden, Ft. Union, and Santa Fe, all of which trails </seg>

thence to Cincinnati, Ohio, where the daughter, Mary, became 
a teacher in the public schools of that city until he 
marriage. Iiobt. W. Furnas and Mary E. McComas were 
married at Cincinnati, October 29, 1845. Eight childre 
were born to the parents; six sons and two daughters, th 
three youngest in Nebraska. Came to Brownville, Neb 
April 6, 1856. The couple celebrated their fiftieth marriag 
anniversary at Brownville, Neb., October 29, 1895. Mrs 
Furnas died at Brownville, Neb., April 1, 1897. Her histor 
since in Nebraska was substantially that of her husband, to 
whom she was ever a constant helpmate in his efforts to d

introduce and develop the silk industry in Nebraska, i 
which she was successful. Specimens of her work can be 
seen at the State Historical Rooms, Lincoln, Neb.

FREIGHTING — DENVER AND BLACK HILLS. 

FREIGHTING— DENVER AND BLACK HILLS. 

The following paper was read by Mr. H. T. Clarke, of Omaha, before the annual 
meeting of the Nebraska State Historical Society, January 9, 1901. 

Fis with pleasure that I respond to the request for some 
1 as to the "Early Freighting," as I realize that few are 
to tell the story of those times. 

I But little freighting was done north of the Platte Rive 
itil the opening of the Pike's Peak gold excitement, abou 
59. The route from Bellevue, where we outfitted am 
?ighted from, and from Omaha, was westerly, crossing th 
khorn River by ferry, or ford, near Elkhorn City, nearl 
&gt;st from Omaha, entering the Elkhorn and Platte valleys 
that point, and thence up the Platte valley. Some crosset 
e Platte to the south side at Shinn's Ferry, owned by Elde 
linn, a few miles southwest of the present town of Schuyler 
)lfax County; others continuing up the Platte on the nort 
le to a point near old Fort Kearney and Dobytown, cross 
g by fording the river to the south side of the Platte there 
id continuing on the south side of the Platte and of th 
&gt;uth Platte to Pike's Peak, or Cherry Creek, now the beaut 
1 city of Denver. 

I Many of the Californians and Mormons going to Salt Lake 
ty and California kept on the north side of the Platte and 
i the north fork by old land marks, Court House and Chimy 
rocks (the former eight miles southeast and the latter 
ren miles west of Camp Clark), and on west. 

I The roads were usually very fine and the grass good ; were 
not so, it would have been hard to supply the mining 
pulation. 

A train usually consisted of from twenty-two to twenty- </seg>

six teams, five yoke of cattle to a team, and two wagon 
loaded with 4,000 pounds on the front and 3,000 pounds on 
the trailer, or rear wagon, which was attached to the leadin 
wagOB with a short pole. There were also two-horse coo 
wagons. Usually a wagon boss, or manager, and assistant 
had charge, and whose pay varied from $75 to $150 a montl 
ami teamster*, at from $35 to $60 per month. Men usuall 
slept under wagons; sometimes trains carried and used tents 
and at times the men crawled under wagon covers. 

In going into camp the teams would form a corral, swinj. 
: to the right and left until they came together, and follow 
; in this way, the first wheels of the rear wagon coining close 
the rear wheels of the first wagon, and when all were i 
ming a complete corral, oval in shape, leaving only rooi 
the cattle to pass out. The opening was closed by chaii 
en the cattle were in, and the wheels of the wagons wei 
chained together, so that in yoking wild cattle the corra 
uld he able to hold them, and in case of attack by Indian 
would he able to protect ourselves behind the wagon 
e cattle were then unyoked and driven out to water an 
d, we keeping two or more men with them so that tin 
uld not stray or stampede. When ready to bring in tl 
tie to yoke, they were all driven within the corral, ea&lt; 
n getting his own teams. 

I The usual drive was fifteen to eighteen miles a day, one 
im trailing on after the others. Many of the wagon bosses 
id men could take the time of night by the position of the 
g dipper to the north star, when the sky was clear. Usu!v 
we would start the teams in the spring as soon as grass 
is up, so as to make good feed, and, with active work, 
ake two trips to Denver (GOO miles) and return in a sean. 
If spring and grass were backward, at times we had to 
•ive back late in the fall to reach the Missouri River, or 
juld "grass"' cattle in the sandhills of western Nebraska, 
tiere the buffalo grass was plenty, until spring. </seg>

ally done on sheet iron or cast iron stoves, or pots am 
covens in absence of stoves. The hill of fare usually wa 
lry salt side pork, bacon, corn meal, loir, beans, drie&lt; 
les, coffee, tea, and sugar, wring "buffalo chips" for fue 

I hen in camp in dry weather the men would be looking to 
setting of tires of the wagons, and if any were loose, no 
ng machinery to reset or upset, or shorten the tire, th» 
on felloe would be increased with one or two thicknesse 
eavy cotton duck tacked on. Then this would be wet am 
wagon tire placed on the ground surrounded by "huffaU 
is" and set on tire. When red-hot ami fully expanded i 
Id be lifted on to the wheel, and as soon as in place 
er poured on so as not to burn the duck or felloe, am 
(»uld shrink into place. It was seldom that a tire ba( 
e set a second time. 

On the dry and sandy roads the oxen often became foot 
sore and lame and had to be shod, and before starting we 
would provide ox shoes to be used if Beetled. Tkej wen 
made in pain for each foot and required but a little col&lt; 
hanuneiiiu; to fit the foot. 

In the summer of 18(3, the Platte Kiver having so nearly 
tl up as to make it difficult to secure water for the cattle 
having a large train of some twenty-two teams, loade&lt; 
li valuable merchandise of all kinds, and being anxiou 
ut the train, I took the stage and overhauled it at For

I We sank headless barrels in the Platte, by digging out the 
kksand, to secure water from an underflow, and usually 
ove much of the night, when cattle will walk much faster 
an in the day time, and got our train through to Denver 
good time, where we sold our goods at satisfactory price*. 

I The quick freighting by horses and mules was done the 
ar around, and usually on goods that were in want, such 
coffee, sugar, candles, and flour, and other goods where 
e supply was short. It was usually done in four and six 
iile, or horse, teams, the freighter carrying his own supply 
ang for the trip, storing corn as he went west, at ranches 
stations where he could secure hay and stabling, to use on 
3 return. Some made money out of this, receiving eight to 
elve and fifteen cents per pound, as also did many farmers 
(1 small freighters, with a single team loaded with butter, 
gs, poultry, dressed hogs, sausages, lard, etc. 

(We used to drive six days in a week, and remain in camp 
I day Sunday. I think that most of the freighters except 
ex Majors, Waddell, and Russell drove seven days, but I 
ink we made as good time as those who did not lay up for 
tndays. 

PREPARE FOR THE REDS. 

I The fall of 1865 the Indians were very bad along the west 
atte Valley, and the government had stationed troops along 
e valley to protect the people, stages, mail, and freighters 
ssing, the officers insisting that they should keep together 
much as possible. The following is the order issued to

us were bad. This made it very slow work, and we coul 
make the progress as when driving single file. On th

Ehe United States court of claims officers allowed our bill

We were quite successful in the selection of goods, in 
freighting and selling the same, seldom having anything bu 
what paid a good margin. Merchants in the mountains 
would pay well when they wanted goods, but woe to the man 
who had to sell when goods were not in demand. 

HIGH PRICES IN THOSE DAYS. 

I Eggs, at times, would sell at $1.50 a dozen. One year w 
d a large quantity of butter and sold it at $1 a pound 
lolesale, in packages of 100 aiid 120 pounds. Oetego 
?el and rope were articles that brought good prices whe 
inted, fifty cents a pound readily, but one half of tha 
len a good supply was in. Sometimes Hour would ge 
arce and sell at $20 to $30 a sack, and so with coffee, suga 
id candles. Cove oysters, pea dies, caned corn, and wa 
ndles were like gold dollars — always staple. 

In 18G6, in closing out our stock at Denver, we traded to 
Hurtle &amp; Metz, formerly merchants from Bellevue, canned 
turkey and chicken, spices, vtc, valued at $1,300, for 320 
acres of land in Sarpy County, and later sold the same for 
$16,000.

HOW CLARKE BUILT HIS BRIDGE 

In the winter of 1875 and ! 76, Stephens &amp; Wilcox of 
aha and other merchants requested that I should look over 
North Platte line to Camp Kobinson and Sheridan. They 
I other Omaha jobbers wasted to make a short line be- 
K?n Sidney and the military stations and the Black Hills 
i country, which was then going as far west as Cheyenne, 
1 crossing the Platte at old Fort Laramie, ninety mil«-s 
it of Camp Clarke, and see if it was practicable to bridge 
Platte at that point. I did so, and reported favorablv. 
e bridge would be some 2,000 feet or more long. They then 
lertook to ton a bridge company and put in a bridge, but 
ind Omaha people were not willing to put money in so 
ge an undertaking in the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian 
mtry, and had to give it up. Then they came to me and 
nted to know if I would put in a toll bridge and accept a 
ius. I answered, "Yes," and the amount named was satactory. 
They soon made up the amount, and I placed

Son, Moline, 111., and Schruker &amp; Miller, Davenport, la., to 
construct the bridge. 

The Chicago &amp; Hock Island and the Union Pacific railroad 
saw the importance &gt;f the move and freighted all materia 
free of cost from those points to Sidney — consisting of thfCl 
large wagon train loads and teamed it from Sidney to th

I built, and is still standing. It was strong enough t 
TJ mining Machinery over, on short coupled wagon 
wn by seven to ten yoke of cattle, being, in fact, stron 
ugh to carry a railway train. 

Tins bridge is some nine miles east of Chimney Hock and 
is seven miles north and west of Court House Roek — old land 
marks on the California, Oregon, and Salt Lake trails, which 
are still to be seen, some on river bottoms and some on bench 
lands, where the great overland trains went to those • 
em countries in the 7&gt;0s and "(!0s.

Then came a stampede from the Black Hills, of some UM 
people, claiming the mines had played out. Captain Jack 
Me Coll of Lexington, Xeti. (late candidate for governor), 
with others came to inquire if they could cross the bridge, or 
would they have to go east on the north side to the town of

tgether, and many of them were broke and had no money, 
replied that they could cross, and those that had money 
uld pay and those that had none could pass free. 

I This looked discouraging, and I thought of the old saying, 
fool and his money soon parted." Fortunately for the 
•iter, there was much gold in the Black Hills and much 
lvel from Sidney to points north over the bridge. With the 
ening of the bridge and short route between the railad 
and Ettdaey, Dead wood, Coaler City, Lead City, 
ipid City, and other mining camps, the travel changed 
mi Cheyenne and other poirits to Sidney, and in a short 
ne Sidney was the great starting point for all eastern and 
stem people, the Indian supplies and travel changing 
oni Cheyenne to Sidney, and Sidney was the most lively of 
iv railroad town on the Union Pacific, and the road beeen 
Sidney and the hills was soon black with the people 
ming and going. 

[The postal department of the general government would 
t furnish mail to the Hills, claiming it was Indian eounv, 
and they had no interest there, although the revenue dertmeut 
of the government collected on whisky, tobacco, 

To make a success of my undertaking, I though it desirable 
that there should be mail facilities in the Black Hills, 
and put on Clarke's Centennial Express, and opened up postoffices 
in all the leading mining camps in the Black Hills. 

I placed Centennial envelopes on sale in all the camps, 
Omaha, and Chicago, and some of the railroad ticket offices. 
I had these made small so as to inclose in ordinary envelopes, 
so that parties could send them when writing to friends and 
insure quick replies. We made the trips each way once a

making it octagon in shape, with port holes on all sides. It 
was made of sawed timber, lying one above the other and 
spiked down. The roof was also made of sawed timber. They 
were anxious to protect the bridge, and placed a squad of 
infantry in the block house and a company of cavalry on 
the south end of the bridge, at Camp Clarke store and postoffice. 
They were large patrons of the bridge in passing supplies, 
quartermasters" commissary stores, artillery, soldiers, 
etc.. and with the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian war on, as it 
was late in 1876 and 1877, it would have been hard for them 
to have got along without it. They paid me large sums of 
money for the use of the bridge. The nearest bridge wist 
was ninety miles, at Fort Laramie, and 130 miles to North 
I'latte City on the east. 

Erhe rates for crossing were |2 for two horses, mules, or 
m, wagon and driver, and was fifty cents for each adional 
horse, mule, ox, or man. I had more fears that 
ie bad white men would burn the bridge than the Indians; 
: latter had always been friendly to me at Bellevue. in 
&gt;.". when we had l,(M&gt;0 Oinahas and the Sioux and Cheyles, 
from '76 to '77 and later. </seg>

I Later on I contracted with March &amp; Stephenson to put 
ur-horse coaches on to cany my mail, paying them ?4,000 
r year, and thus get stage services bet ween Sidney, Camp 
take, Camp ]{obinson. Rapid City, Peadwood, and other 
vvns iind camps in the Hills, and later the gwaMttlt conuted 
to transport the mails, taking the place of Clarke's 
nieiinial Express. 

Ehe bridge was a great success, bat the Centennial Ex 
¦ was unprofitable, owing to the large expense for men 
ML and feed. 

Ihere were but few buffalo in the valley after ISTti. Th 
one I saw was an old stray bull, in 1877. In passin 
th on the stage I saw him some distance on" eoming on 
hills. On our return we passed within a few rods &lt; 
, on Greenwood creek, with a score or more of steers, a 
hiag at the mouth, trying to drive him away, taking hit 
an interloper. They were unsuccessful, as he took hi 
i time to go. This was near where the Indians had killet 
ng Schaffer's family, from IMattsmouth, a short tiin 

In the matter of early transportation east and south, ther 
i been a wonderful change, as formerly we were dependen 
the Missouri River during the season of navigation, whe 
e from ice. We had the large boats from Omaha to S 
uis that plied between New Orleans and St. Louis in th 
iter season and often 1,000 miles up the river from Omah 
rammer. Many of them were very fine boats, and countet 
ten to fourteen days for a trip from St. Louis to Belle 
B or Omaha. The fare for passengers was about $2i 
ich included stateroom with board. 

(Freight was from thirty-five to forty cents per 100 pounds 
merchandise, and twenty-fire to thirty-five cents per 100 
corn, and thirty cents to $1 per 100 on wheat. 

rn 18fi.~&gt; I have loaded steamers with wheat at $1 per 100, 
sixty cents a bushel. At that time gold was worth |8.40, 
140 premium, and wheat $2.40 a bushel. All corn was </seg>

shipped in gunny bags, a coarse square bag holding about 
140 pounds, imported from Calcutta, India. Wheat was 
shipped in cotton bags, now selling at fifteen cents apiece. 
We paid U high as $1.15 each for them. 

I had the pleasure of shipping the first wheat on th 
Union Pacific Railroad, from Fremont and North Bend t 
Omaha, purchased by Hon. E. II. Rogers, of Fremont, an 
Mr. Cottrell, father of L. R. Cottrell, grain dealer at Nort 
Bend, now of Omaha. I think the freight was twenty-tw 
cents from Fremont and twenty-five cents from North Bend 
per 100 pounds, about the same price as from Omaha t 
Chicago, and more by five cents per 100 pounds than to St 
Louis, at that time by railroad, and that with three grea 
railroads to St. Louis and five to Chicago, and the Missour 
River a failure for transportation. 

WONDROUS TRANSFORMATION 

As we" now look back over the past twenty-five years from 
187G, with the loss of Caster and the many faithful follow 
ers, the Cheyenne Indian war — then forty years to the grea 
Pike's Peak gold discovery, and pushing forward to the 
same — then again back to the many thousands of Cali 
fornians and Mormons passing, who went west on foot an&lt; 
by wagon over the great overland route, fifty years ago, we 
stand amazed. 

Then only a few thousand people lived in Iowa and Ne 
braska along the Missouri Hirer Valley, not knowing wha 
they had before them — dependent on the Missouri River for 
transporting all supplies, save the staples we raised. I have 
often thought how fortunate Nebraska people were in hav 
ing Council Bluffs, Glenwood, Rockport, etc., along the eas 
side of the Missouri River, the same to supply us with flour 
meal, meat, butter, and eggs, and the great river, for a hal 
of the year, bringing in supplies. Little did we then think 
that this great river would be abandoned for connnercia 
purposes, and which is better to navigate to-day than thirty </seg>

tin* three great loads to St. Louis and five great roads to 
ietgo — a night's ride to St. Louis or Chicago, with 
neely Pullman and dining ears attached, instead of a ten 
fourteen days' trip to and from St. Louis. 

IA.nd then to look to the west — four great roads reachin 
Denver and California and Oregon, and out to the Orient — 
light to Denver and four days to the Pacific Ocean. Am 
?n at the cities of Omaha, Lincoln, and the many fine, a&lt;

rous people, l»st soil and markets for the great staple pm 
ts of life, wheat, corn, oats, cattle, hogs, and sheep; wit 
2 third largest packing industry in the world, and tha 
ly fifteen years old. 

I May we not stop and think of the wonderful progress we 
ve made, and what of another fifty years? If it has been 
r fortune to see all this, making part of the great link from 
ndon, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Portland, to 
iwaiian Islands, Japan, China, and Australia over our 
airies, what may we or our children see in this, the tweiith 
century? And why, as we start with it, may it not be 
th the feeling that "we have built better than we knew." 
d push forward, resolved, if possible, to make Nebraska

I For these many years I have been happy with the thougl

EARLY FREIGHTING AND CLAIMS CLCB DATS. 

EAKLY FBEIGHTING AND CLAIMS CLUB DAYS 

IX NEBRASKA. 

rn by Eugene Mann, University Flam, for the annual meeting of the 
Nebraska State Hi&gt;t irical Society, January 10, 1900. 

Et the solicitation of the Historical Society of Nebraska 
¦ri'with submit a brief sketch of some of the early times 
febraaka, and I can best tell it by giving some of my own 
'i-ienccH. 

Being of a venturesome turn of mind, I left a comfortable 
home in Ohio for the West in 185&amp; The fall of 185(5 found 
me in Nebraska with a resolve to east my anchor here and 
take my chances with the ingrowth of a new country, and 
nothing in s*tock save health and ambition. After drifting 
around at this and that until the summer of 1868, I went 
into the employ of IIusscll, Majors &amp; Waddell, who had a 
large contract to transport supplies for the army commanded 
by Albert Sidney Johnston, which had marched into Utah 
to quell the rebellious spirit of the Mormons. To supply this 
army required eighty trains of twenty six wa^ms each, each 
wagon being loaded with &lt;&gt;,000 to (i,."&gt;00 pounds and drawn 
by six yoke of oxen — there being 312 oxen to a train and a 
total of 12,r&gt;()0.000 pounds. The total number employed was 
L\40() men and 24,1K!O oxen. For this work, the company received 
$22 to $27 per hundred pounds. 

Ei re I wish to state that at that time there were no settlers 
veen the Missouri Hirer and Utah, except a limited minilocated 
at the government forts and occasionally a 
¦eh squaw-man. 

Ehis wild, venturesome life seemed to suit my fancy, and I, 
i thousands of others, did not settle down to quiet life 
1 after the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad when </seg>


            <seg id="p315">

I opportunity for leading this kind of a roving life was 
on from us. We so-called "overland freighters" received 
our compensation, as my memory serves WHt, alxtut f0.75 
5 per hundred pounds for each one hundred miles, 
dcd by distance, risk, and competition. 

Daring this period of nine yean there were millions of 
pounds of stipjdit's hauled by oxen and mules to the interior 
forts and mining camps in the mountains &lt;,f Colorado, Wyoming, 
Utah, and Montana. The supplies for the troops coned 
of (lour, bacon by the thousands of tons. Mgar, coffee, 
canned fruits, liquors, and Urge quantities of corn for the 
cavalry horses; for the mining camps they consisted of a 
general stock of provisions, groceries of all kinds, and dry 
Is and clothing; while the Utah trade comprised principally 
general merchandise and farm implements. 

At this point, I might cite one instance in 1866. I commanded 
a large train bound for Utah, and among the 
articles hauled were two '"Pitts" separators (thrashers) for 
which we received $0.25 per pound freight, gross weight. 
These machines were not on trucks, there were no extra straw 
carriers, and cost, laid down in Utah, $3,000 to $3,500 each. 
We also had twelve combined "Buckeye" harvesters and 
mowers, which cost, laid down in Salt Lake City, $1,000 

Another instance of a long haul: we delivered in lstii at 
Virginia City, Montana, a distance by wagon road in thoM 
days of 1,400. miles, a complete stock of drugs and ¦tore lixtures 
with a quantity of liquor, for which we were paid 
f0.28 per pound in gold dust 

Ehese nine years spent in overland freighting were brimof 
adventures, crossing swollen streams, in snow storms, 
&gt;unters with the Indians, etc. 

At one time in 18G0 I attempted to swim the Platte Kiver 
near the mountains when it was very high, and it came near 
being my last swim. I had given up all hopen of life, had 
ceased further efforts, and let myself down to drown when, </seg>

great joy, I touched bottom! I finally reached the 
re as near drowned as a man could be and yet not be. 

Again in 18G7 in swimming the Missouri Hiver in Montana, 
when the slush ice was running thick, I barely escaped 
with my life and that of my faithful saddle mule. 

These were hairbreadth escapes and yet never so thrillin 
and startling as the Indian war-whoop, which would start 
the coolest and most brave and cause his hair to bristle so 
fit iontly to lift his hat in polite response to "Brother L&lt;&gt; 
I have boon held up several times at close range, but was fo 
tunate enough to get the drop on my antagonist and cause 
him to retreat in haste. I never shot an Indian nor had on 

I While traveling up and down the Platte ltiver Valley, 
1 the pleasure of giving the old veteran chief, Red Cloud 
the Sioux tribe, many a meal of bread, coffee, and bacon 
was a grand old Indian. On one occasion he came int 
be oldham's, a neighboring camp to mine, and asked fo 
i captain (as the wagomuasters were called). When th 
•tain was pointed out to him, the old chief approache&lt; 
1 asked for something to eat (they always seemed to be 
ngry). The captain answered, "Oh, go away, you! 
en the old chief retorted that he had been to Washingto 
1 shaken hand with the "Great Captain"' and "you, yo 
away, you." It is useless to state that the old chie 
; his cup of coffee. 

IHany of you have heard of and perhaps some of you know 
uething about the Claim Clubs in the early days of Neisk 
— in 1856-57. These were committees organized by 
i early settlers to protect each other in holding more land 
in the United States laws allowed them. The law granted 
h bona fide settler 160 acres, while these clubs would claim 
•rything in sight, and when an outsider came in and 
[uatted' 7 on any of this land, which to all appearances, and 
record, was vacant, he was visited by this club, and I am 
Ty to say, many were never seen after being taken in 
irge by said club. </seg>

The nndenrigaed "squatted" on a quarter section in Cass 
County in May, 1857, built a claim house, not very expensive 
but sufficient to till the reqnireoKati of the law, and livc&lt; 
in the same long enough to make the claim good. He wa 
then visited by one of these clubs, known as the Hock Bluff 
Club, consisting of about fifty persons, all armed with vari 
mis kinds of weapons, and all to arrest one lone individua 
with nothing more than a pocket-knife about him. For 
tunately, I was acquainted with one of the men, L. I!. Box 
ley. an old Virginian. They organized a court and I wa 
called upon to state my case to the judge and jury. I did M 
after this manner, as I was not in a very good humor: first 
I said that a trial was useless and worse than a farce, for 
could read the verdict already in the countenances of th 
members of the so-called jury; second, that I was in tliei 
hands and that they could, and would, do with me as the; 
pleased. At this juncture my old friend Boxley, who came 
along with the club as a sort of mediator, stated that he hai 
known the prisoner favorably, and suggested that the claim 
ant and myself should each choose a man to arbitrate ou 
claims on said land, to which suggestion I readily assented 
as it was the only and best way out of it. The result was, 
was paid $5 per day for the five days that I had put in on the 
claim, with the privilege of moving my house off. 

f'he census of 1835 gave Otoe County a population of 
$; Douglas County, 1,028; and next, Cass County, 712. 
i census complete ga"ve the Territory 4,401 inhabitants. 
1856, when the writer landed in Otoe County, Nebraska 
y was considered the largest town in the Territory, having 
apulation of about 2,000. 

The early settlers located near the river, none venturing 
back far, for all had to depend on the steamboat traffic on 
the Missouri River for supplies. Almost everything that wa 
needed was brought up the river by steamboat. Pine lum 
ber sold at from $60 to $100 per thousand feet, and every 
other article was proportionately as high. </seg>

THE BUILDING OF THE FIRST CAPITOL AND IN- 

SANE HOSPITAL AT LINCOLN— REMOVAL 

OF ARCHIVES. 

•Written for the Nebraska State Historical Society by Franklin Ball, 
Palmyra, Neb. 

I MM most Important event in the history of the State at 
is period (1867) is the removal of the capital from Onialia 
Lincoln, the founding of the capital in the midst of an 
most nnbroken prairie, and the location of the capitol by 
itvernor Butler, Auditor (Jillespie, and Secretary Kennard 
I commission for selecting a site. The afternoon of July 
I, lS(i7, having examined all the favorable sites there, the 
lection was made, Lancaster haying received two voles ob 
e first ballot and Aslilaud one. On the second ballot ii 
us made unanimons in favor of Lancaster. The ground 
is broken for the foundation (the honor of which was giren 
Master Fred Martin Donovan, the first child born to the 
dest settler of Lancaster County) January 11, 1S0S. The 
intract for furnishing the material and labor and erecting 
e building was awarded to James Ward, of Chicago, for 
e sum of *&lt;;r&gt;,000. 

There was a sod building with a board roof east of the 
lpitol which was built for a boarding house and was used 
Mich until there was a boarding house built down town, 
&gt; that the men could get places to board. The south end of 
ic sod house was used for a dining room. On the sides 
ere bunks for the men to sleep in. They cooked in the north 
nd. In the northwest corner was a small room which Mr. 
Vard had his office in, until about the 1st of October, 1868. 
\fter it was abandoned for n boarding house it was used 
or a carpenter shop. </seg>

ight on the river. It took so many wagm loads that 
Id be impossible to get the capitol done by the 1st of Deber, 
for we were fifty miles from the Missouri Hirer, an* 
as almost impossible to get any material in season. 

The money to build the capitol was from the proceeds o 
the sale of lots, which was to be deposited witli the Stat 
Treasurer. This was not complied with because of the rumo 
that the enemies of the enterprise would enjoin the Treasure 
against payment of money upon warrants on the buildin 
fund, which most likely would have defeated the commis 
sinners, for it would have delayed operations till too late t 
secure the erection of the state house, even if the courts hat 
not sustained the injunction. The money was kept where n 
man knew about it but the commissioners. One man sak 
that lots of money was paid out and no record kept of it 
Everything was kept so that the enemies of building th 
capitol could not get hold of anything, so as to stop th 
building. They claimed that the location of the capital \va 
not constitutional, for it should be by the votes of the people 
The building of the capitol went on slowly until about th 
1st of December, 1889. About that time Governor Butle 
issued a proclamation announcing the removal of the sea 
of government to Lincoln and ordered the transfer of th 
archives of the Stale to the new capitol from Omaha. Th 
teams were got and all books and fixtures were boxed ant 
loaded up for Lincoln. The roads were bad and the weathe 
was bad, and some of the teams were on the road from six 
to ten days. As they arrived at Lincoln they were unloads </seg>

Nebraska City in a scow and made the first road from that
