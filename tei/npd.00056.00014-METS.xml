            <seg id="p002">THE Scottsbluff Experiment Substation is located on the North Platte Reclamation Project, 6 miles east of Mitchell and 8 miles northwest of Scottsbluff, Ne - braska. The tract consists of 160 acres of land irri - gated from the Government Canal. A wide variety of experiments are being conducted with irrigated crops. The work of the farm is maintained cooperatively by the University of Nebraska and the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and is under the direction of a superin - tendent detailed by the Office of Western Irrigation Agriculture, U. S. Department of Agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">Crop Rotation Under Irrigation JAMKS A. HOMlEX &gt;TTSRI. UKK EXPERIMENT STATION From results obtained during the past 11 years from the 35 different crop rotation systems conducted at the Scottsbluff Experiment Substation, it is evident that the cropping system followed by the farmers of the North Platte Valley determines to a very large degree the success or failure of the fanning operation. If the farmer follows a well planned cropping sys - tem and properly cares for the crops, he will realize a profit, while if he follows a poor cropping system he will lose money even tho he gives his crops the best of care. l'l:i\&lt; IIM.K.n AXI) ADVANTAGES IX CROP ROTATION KSSEXTIAL.S OF A l.oill) ROTATION' By crop rotation is meant the growing of 2 or more crops in a more or less fixed cropping scheme wherein one crop fol - lows another in a definite order and requires as many years as there are crops grown to complete the cycle. While it is true that no one cropping system is the best for all farms, there are certain fundamental principles that should be followed in all rotations. Every rotation should include either alfalfa, sweet clover, or some other leguminous crop and the application of barnyard manure to keep up or increase the productiveness of the land. No rotation is complete without a cultivated crop, such as potatoes, corn, or sugar beets. Small grain should also be included in the rotation but should be used only when alfalfa or sweet clover is seeded with it. The farm should be divided into as many fields of somewhat equal size as there are years in the rotation, so that the respective number of acres of each crop will be grown every year. SAY KM I \ Hi &gt; II If the rotation is properly planned the farm labor will be better distributed, so that less hired help will be needed. Since all crops do not require planting at the same time, it is possi- </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 190 ble to plant one before the proper time to plant the other. For instance, small grain and alfalfa should be seeded between April 10 and 15 ; sugar beets, between April 15 and 30 ; corn, the first week in May or a little earlier ; potatoes between May 20 and June 1. With such a variety of crops the proper time of planting is distributed from April 10 to June 1. No one crop could be successfully planted at such wide range of dates. What is true of planting is also more or less true of irrigating, cultivating, and harvesting. hi:tti ii isk ok \\ \ i i n A better use of irrigation water is another very important factor in favor of crop rotation. When a crop needs irrigation it is very important that it be irrigated at once. A week's delay will sometimes materially reduce the yield. All crops do not need irrigating at the same time, however, so that it is possible, under a crop rotation system, to irrigate one crop before another crop needs it. Inigation usually begins with alfalfa followed by small grain. These 2 crops in normal years can be irrigated twice before sugar beets, potatoes, or corn needs irrigating. Where water becomes scarce during the summer, it is advisable to begin irrigating early so as to have the alfalfa and small grain well irrigated before the water is needed for the cultivated crops. Where a one-crop system is followed and where the amount of iirigation water is limited, it is impossible to irrigate all of the crop before some of it suffers badly from a lack of moisture. This is especially true of such a crop as alfalfa or small grain when the land is flooded. l.l&gt;» DIMKAKK The practice of crop rotation lessens the trouble from various pests and diseases. This is especially true of some of the diseases of potatoes. The organisms producing scab, Rhizoctonia, and wilt in potatoes are capable of living in the soil for 2 or 3 years in the absence of the potato plants. The growing of potatoes continuously or in short rotations allows these organisms to increase in such numbers that the potatoes become so badly diseased that they are unmarketable. What is true of potato diseases is more or less true of the diseases of some of the other crops. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Crop Rotation Under Irrigation 5 LESS KISK FKOM HAIL Damaging effect of hail depends largely upon the stage of development of the various crops when it comes. A severe hailstorm early in the season might completely destroy a stand of sugar beets but would be too early to injure small grain, corn, or potatoes, while later in the season a hailstorm could completely destroy some of the other crops with but little injury to the sugar beets. The practice of crop rotation, there- ire, lesser s the risk from hail. Production of various crops tends to lessen the effect of low markets. When a farmer fails to adopt a definite cropping system, he is often tempted to jump from one extreme to another, as was the case during the summer of 1922 with the potato acreage. It seldom happens that the market prices of all farm products are low for the same year. In 1921 the prices of com and alfalfa were low but potatoes were high, while the next year, corn and alfalfa sold at a high price with prac - tically no market at all for potatoes. In 1921, potatoes were more profitable than sugar beets, while in 1922 sugar beets were far more profitable than potatoes. The only safe prac - tice is for a fanner to decide what crops under his conditions are the most profitable for him to grow and then plan his cropping system accordingly and adhere to it as closely as possible year after year. KASIF.H TO KKKP LIVESTOCK A properly planned rotation facilitates the keeping of live - stock, in which the farms of the North Platte Valley are con - spicuously lacking. On many farms the only livestock is the necessary work horses. It is becoming very evident that the farmer who keeps a small flock of hens and a few good dairy cows is far more successful than the strictly crop-farmer. With sweet clover as a summer pasture and alfalfa and corn silage as a winter feed, dairying should become one of the leading industries of the valley. Hogs are also profitable on irrigated farms when grown on alfalfa with a limited grain ration. Pasturing alfalfa or sweet clover on the land or returning these crops to the land in the form of barnyard manure will l.KWSKNS KKKKCTS OF LOW MAHKKTS </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 190 greatly increase the yields of succeeding crops and thereby produce a greater profit from the farming operations. Low yield is the fanner's greatest handicap. It costs practically as much to produce a low yield as it does a high one. It is that extra bushel or ton above the cost of production that makes the profit. SUMMARY OF ROTATION KXPKRIMEXTS The land on which these rotations are being conducted is a light sandy loam, fairly representative of the soil under the Interstate canal. The soil is comparatively uniform, well drained and irrigates easily. As the yields of all crops are greatly increased when following an application of barnyard manure or a legume crop such as alfalfa or sweet clover, it indicates that the soil is low in organic matter. The land was broken out from native sod and seeded to oats one year before the experiment began. Thirty-two different rotations were be - gun in the spring of 1912 and 3 more were added in the spring of 1920. These are arranged in different cropping and rotation systems, varying in length from continuously cropped plats to a 7-year rotation. Some of the rotations receive manure at the rate of 12 tons per acre, while others do not receive any. Some have alfalfa or sweet clover and others do not. The size of the plats used in these experiments is one-quarter acre. I.KI'K&lt; 1 OK M\M 111 AMI AI.K\I.I \ As it frequently requires a number of years of cropping before the effect of the rotation is manifest, the first 5 years' results here are omitted and only the results of the past 6 years are used — that is, the results from 1917 to 1922 inclu - sive. The plats that received no manure or that have never produced alfalfa gave much higher yields during the first 5 years than they did the last 5 years. The manured plats and the plats previously in alfalfa yielded about the same for both periods. The spread in yields, therefore, from these differently treated plats is due to a decreased yield from the plats Hot receiving manure nor having alfalfa, rather than to an increase from the manured or alfalfa plats. The average yield for the 6 years clearly shows the effect of manure and alfalfa. Sugar beets on unmanured land yielded 9.6 tons per acre, on man - ured land, 17.5 tons, and on alfalfa land the second and third year after it was plowed up, 16.6 tons. This is an increase of </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Crop Rotation Under Irrigation 7 7.9 tons from application of manure and 7 tons from growing of alfalfa in rotation. Sugar beets grown in the sweet clover rotation, which was begun in 1920, show that pastured sweet clover land is equally as good as alfalfa land. Potatoes yielded 113.7 bushels on unmanured land, 183.8 bushels on manured land, and 289.3 bushels when following alfalfa, or 70.1 bushels increase from manure and 175.6 bushels increase following alfalfa. The average yield of corn was 32.2 bushels on unman - ured land and 60 bushels when grown on alfalfa land. The average yield of oats was 46.1 bushels on unmanured, 62.2 bushels on manured land, and 66.6 bushels on alfalfa land ; and wheat yielded 20 bushels on unmanured land and 28 bushels on alfalfa land. Flax has been a complete failure the past 6 years. The yields in 1922 of all crops in the rotations were uni - formly good. The season was not favorable to one crop and unfavorable to another. The yields, therefore, of the different crops grown on unmanured, manured, alfalfa, or sweet clover land will show the beneficial effect of manure, alfalfa, and sweet clover on the yields of succeeding crops. Table 1 gives these yields when figured to an acre basis : TABLE 1 — Yields on an acre basis from crops grown in the tation experiments, showing effect of manure, alfalfa, and tweet clover on yield of different crops for the season 1922, the eleventh year The crop yield of the eleventh year, as given in the above table, plainly shows the value of manure, alfalfa, and sweet clover in keeping up the productiveness of the land. Where no manure is applied or alfalfa or sweet clover is not grown on the land at frequent intervals, the land soon loses its producing power and the yields become so low that they are unprofitable. The manure used in these rotations is applied directly either to the sugar beet crop or to the potato crop. Oats in the rotation follows the manure the second and third season Croi Un- manurvd j !

            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 190 after it is applied. Potatoes, com, and wheat follow alfalfa the first season, sugar beets the second and third season, and oats the second season after the alfalfa is plowed up. The short rotations that receive manure produce good crops of sugar beets but potatoes grown in any of the short rotations are so poor in quality that they are unmarketable. Potatoes and corn give best results when grown on alfalfa land the first year after the alfalfa is plowed up, but sugar beets and small grain give the highest yields when following potatoes that were grown on first year alfalfa land. Cora will not do its best when grown on sugar beet land. CASH UK I I K.\H II l( &gt; Kill' When the returns from these different crops are expressed in dollars and cents the effect of the rotation is even more apparent. The prices used in figuring the returns from these different crops and rotations are : Interest and depreciation of farm equipment, taxes and water charges, $10 per acre ; man and team, $5 per day ; alfalfa hay, $6 per ton ; sugar beets, $5 per ton; No. 1 potatoes, 60 cents per bushel; cull potatoes, 15 cents per bushel ; oats, 35 cents per bushel ; and wheat, 70 cents per bushel. No charge is made for the manure except the cost of hauling it and spreading it upon the land. On the basis of these prices and the 6-year average yields, potatoes show both the greatest loss and the highest profit as will be seen in Table 2. On an acre basis, potatoes grown on the same land year after year show a loss of more than $42, while the potatoes grown on alfalfa land in the 6 and 7-year rotations show a net profit of $75. The average loss from all the potato plats grown in the short rotations — 3 years or less — amounted to more than $35 per acre, while those grown on alfalfa land in the longer rotations yielded a net profit of more than $50. Sugar beets grown in rotations not having alfalfa or sweet clover nor receiving manure showed a small loss, but when grown in rotations having either of these legume crops or receiving manure, they returned a net profit of between $20 and $40 per acre. Corn varied from a small loss in the poor rotations to a net profit of $12 per acre when grown on alfalfa land. Small grain always showed a loss from the poor rota - tions and seldom a profit from the good ones. The same crop in all rotations is treated alike so far as the variety, the quantity and quality of seed used, the date of </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Crop Rotation Under Irrigation 9 planting and cultivation and irrigation are concerned. In other words, the cultural practices are the same. The only variation is the difference in the rotation or the applying of manure. l \»ll HI II UN PKK ROTATION These 35 different cropping systems might well be divided into 2 classes — poor rotations and good ones. The poor ones are short and do not contain either alfalfa or sweet clover, while the good ones are longer and in them about one-half of the land is kept in alfalfa or sweet clover. Table 2 gives the profit or loss from some of these different cropping systems when figured to the basis of an 80-acre farm in which 77 acres re cropped and when the prices as above stated are used. The Ids used are 6-year averages. </seg>

            <seg id="p011">Crop Rotation Under Irrigation 11 As will be seen from Table 2, all one-crop systems show a financial loss, varying from $192 with com to $3,234 with pota - toes. All rotations not having alfalfa show a loss, except one 2-year rotation of oats and sugar beets manured. Every rota - tion having alfalfa shows a profit even tho the alfalfa crop shows a loss in the shorter rotations. With the information furnished in Table 2 it should be pos - sible for an irrigation farmer to plan a profitable cropping sys - tem. On many farms it will be necessary to have 2 separate rotations. This is true where both alfalfa and sweet clover are used. The diagram on the cover page represents an 80-acre fann on which 2 different rotations are used — one a 4-year rotation and the other a 7-year rotation. The 4-year rotation has 3 acres of sweet clover, 6 acres of silage corn, and 3 acres of barley seeded with sweet clover. This rotation is planned primarily to furnish summer pasture and winter silage for a small herd of dairy cows. The 7-year rotation occupies the greater part of the farm and produces the "money" crops, alfalfa hay, and barley, and supplies alfalfa pasture for hogs. If the farm is a considerable distance from a beet dump, corn can take the place of sugar beets in the 7-year rotation. When com is given proper care and fed to hogs on alfalfa pasture it is a profitable crop. [.-.M] </seg>
