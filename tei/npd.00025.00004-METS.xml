Kr. McLeod: I find Boone county not represented. That Is, the report isn't In. All we can give are the counties that have the reports </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Secretary Mellor: I will state that there is a postal card report from Boone county. You have a postal card report from there. Mr. McLeod: I didn't copy that in. Secretary Mellor: It is there. President Rudge: Who is the delegate from Boone county? Secretary Mellor: There is none named on the postal card report. Mr. McLeod: Boyd county, Henry Rineheimer; Brown county, W. H. Peck. These are the presidents: Buffalo county, Henry Gibbons; Cedar county has no full report, although it might have a card, although I didn't notice. Clay county, W. F. Holcomb. Now, as to Cunting county, the committee has not taken formal action yet; and I want to state to the Board, that, so far as I am personally concerned, I think the law would compel me to act adversely, although I would rather see Cum ing county come in as the Wisner Stock Show, than a great many of our county fairs. They have a stock fair that is a credit to the county, a credit to the state, and is only excelled by the State Fair in the state of Nebraska; and if there is any legal way to allow them representation at this meeting I would like very much to do it. But, as I understand the law, and as the law sounds to me, although I have to differ with our Secretary somewhat, I do not think they are entitled to a vote here to - day. But that is left entirely with you. They filed a report the same as any county association, and their president is S. Emley. Custer county. W. A. George; Dawes county, Charles Mann; Dawson county, B.

President Rudge: What pag&lt; ■r. McLeod: On page 21, the constitution and by-laws. (Mr. Mc - thereupon read law referred to, as follows:) "3. The membership of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture consists of twenty-nine members as named in the original act creating the Board, each member being elected for a period of two years, with statutory provisions for further perpetuation, together with the presi - dent of each county society, or delegate therefrom duly authorized, who shall, for the time being, be ex-offlcio members, for the purpose of deliberating and consulting as to the wants, prospects, and conditions of the agricultural interests throughout the state. Presidents or dele - gates from county agricultural societies in actual existence, and which hold fairs annually, regularly making reports to and complying with all other requirements of the State Board, only are 'members ex-offlclo' under the spirit and intent of the law in this case: Provided, any county society not having its annual rcpcrt on file with the Secretary on or before the annual meeting in January of each year forfeits representa - tion at said annual meeting, either by its president or delegate." Mr. McLeod: Now, that is not a county society there. They have wanted to make it a county society. The county would like to haTe It a county society, but it is a corporation. 1 don't know whether they filed articles down here with the Secretary of State or not, but it is a corpor - ation, in which private citizens went to work and subscribed around $5,000. They put up good buildings. They have the best stock. I think, in the state of Nebraska surrounding Wisner. I think if we could possibly allow them in without establishing a precedent that would be detrimental to the interests of the Board, I would like to see it done. If it is legal I would like to see them in; but I can't see where we can legally allow them in. Br. Hervey: I would like to have Mr. McLeod read the section of w creating agricultural societies, county agricultural societies. Mr. McLeod: There may be something In that Mr. Hervey: I think that will define the requirements of an agri - cultural society In the state; that Is, It will define what a recognized agricultural society, county agricultural society, is. Just as Mr. McLeod has expressed, I think that it is a great misfortune that there are not more stock growers' associations permitted as members on the same basis as the county agricultural societies; but, as a matter of fact, w« </seg>
            <seg id="p010">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 10 are obliged to observe the rules, or the law, creating the county agri - cultural societies, and the requirements of those county agricultural societies to make their reports to the State Board of Agriculture. Secretary Mellor: Mr. President. President Rudge: Mr. Mellor. Eretary Mellor: I think you will find that there are possibly three nents for a county agricultural society: One is that it is tn - ted; another is that it contains the membership of twenty or tizens of the county in which it is located, and another is that all secure receipts annually to the amount of $50. As soon as elation complies with those three requirements, it is a question ■ it does not come under this organization. (Copy of statutes banded to Secretary Mellor.) Secretary Mellor: This is the law relating to county agricultural societies: "Whenever twenty or more persons, residents of any county in this state, shall organize themselves into a society for the improvement of agriculture within said county, and shall have adopted a constitu - tion and by-laws agreeable to the rules and regulations furnished by the usual and proper officers, and when the said society shall have raised and paid into the treasury, by voluntary subscription or by fee imposed upon its members, any sum of money, in each year not less than fifty ($50) dollars, and whenever the president of said society shall certify to the county clerk the amount thus paid, in counties having a population of thirty thousand (30,000) or more, the county board shall, and in counties having a population less than thirty thousand (30,000) the county board may order a warrant to be drawn on," — and so on. But those requirements and qualifications are the Incorporation of twenty or more citizens and the payment into the treasury, from receipts of the fair or subscription, the sum of $50, and making a report to this State Board of Agriculture. Now, these things have all been done in the case of the Wisner Live Stock Association. There is no other organization in that county asking for membership to this Association. Therefore. I would consider that this Association be considered as one of our members. Mr. Hervey: Mr. Chairman. President Rudge: Mr. Hervey. Mr. Hervey. There is a further obligation that Mr. Mellor has not read there in regard to what shall be encouraged by this Agricultural Society. It defines distinctly what the work of the Agricultural Society is; and there Is no getting around it. The county agricultural society must in fact be an agricultural society. This association up there being a stock association and exhibiting stock does not disqualify it In any sense; but, as I understand, it Isn't exhibiting other lines of agricul - tural products, as is required by the law. Now, it will be very easy for Mr. Mellor Just to proceed there and read the balance of that, and we will get a little more definite idea of the requirements. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 11 Mr. Mellor thereupon read the remainder of the statute referred to. as follows: "All county agricultural societies organized pursuant to law shall annually offer and award premiums for the improvement of soil, crops, tillage, manures, implements, stock, articles of domestic industry, and such other articles, productions, and improvements as they may deem proper, and perform all such acts as they may deem best calculated to promote the agricultural and manufacturing interests of the county and state. And it shall also be their duty so to regulate the amount of premiums and the different grades of the same as to enable farmers of small as well as large means to compete therefor; and in making the awards special reference shall be had to the profits which may accrue or likely to accrue from improved methods of raising crops, or of the fabrication of the articles thus offered, with the intention that the pre - miums shall be given for the most economical mode of improvement. All persons offering to compete for premiums on improved mode of Ullage, or the production of any crops or other articles, shall be required, before such premiums are adjudged, to deliver to the awarding committee a full and correct statement of the process of such mode of tillage or pro - duction, and the expense and value of the same, with a view of showing accurately the profits derived or expected to be derived therefrom." Secretary Mellor: Now, if Mr. McLeod has personal knowledge we should like to know if they did not offer premiums on agricultural products at this fair. B. McLeod: Really, I don't know; but in this report I see that they total amount of premiums offered, $100; total amount of premiums d, $41-50, but know nothing about it My supposition is that was icultural products, although I failed to get there this year. I near - lys attend. I failed to get there this last fall, but I was told they very fine agricultural exhibit, and I have an idea that is for agri - 1 premiums. Understand, I have no authority for saying It. Eirelary Mellor: I have a letter from the secretary, and he says, hibit live stock at this fair for the glory there is in it." He says, &gt; not give premiums on live stock"; and he says, "We have one best live stock shows in the country." Now, if that is the case, 1.50 must have been paid for something else than live stock. Mr. McLeod: I would judge so; that is my supposition. Mr. Hervey: I would ask Mr. McLeod if Cuming county has any other county fair, — holds any other county fair. Mr. McLeod: I think not. Hooper. I think, is in Dodge county. There is one at Dodge and Hooper, — the same form of association. Mr. Hervey: I believe that this association at Wlsner is really en - titled to a membership In this convention. The mere fact of It being called a stock growers' association, or show, or fair I do not think would necessarily disqualify It, when it has complied with the other provision* of the law. Mr. OUi&gt;: It does not seem to me there la any question, or at </seg>
            <seg id="p012">least, very little question but what these people are entitled to repre - sentation here. I think we want to encourage every county in this state to have an association of some kind and come and be represented in this Association, and if there are counties that haven't developed their associations to the extent that they are offering premiums on everything, as the law says they should, but if they are putting up a good show, as I understand they are there, especially in live stock as they are, without any premiums, I think they are entitled to representation here; and I move you, Mr. President, that they be notified to be represented here. Motion seconded by Mr. Hervey. E President Rudge: It has been moved and seconded that the asscci - i from Cuming county be given a seat in this convention. Axe there remarks? If not, all those In favor of the motion signify by saying contrary, No. The motion is carried. Are there any other delegates here who have not handed in their credentials? .Mr. L. M. Graham: I notice the name of the delegate from Frontier county was not read. I understood this morning that his credentials were here. President Rudge: Mr. Mcl^eod, have you the credentials of Mr Graham from Frontier county? Mr. McLeod: From Frontier county I have Mr. J. D. Bailey. Secretary Mellor: It should be Mr. Graham. We received a cer - tiflcate with the seal on It, stating it is Mr. Graham. I think it is that way. Look for Frontier county report and see if it is not in there. B-esident Rudge: Are there any other delegates here that have ported to the Credential Committee? EE. EL Toungs: Gentlemen, I am here from Dawscn county. I in my credentials to the Credentials Committtee. But I think a had been sent in prior. Am I not right, Mr. Mellor? from Daw - -nty. I am president. Secretary Mellor: I think it is here. President Rudge: What Is the name? Mr. Youngs: E. E. Youngs. President Rudge: E. E Youngs from Dawson county. Mr. McLeod: I will state in regard to Dawson county that I can find no report of this kind from Dawson county. Secretary Mellor: Have you a post card? Mr. Youngs: Since I arrived here I handed in the credentials from our secretary, but, as a matter of fact, he had Just moved his office, and the official seal is not on the document. But we have a live Institu - tion up there, and I think we are entitled to a seat. Secretary Mellor: You have got a letter? Mr. McLeod: I have this letter: Thereupon Mr. McLeod read a letter certifying that Mr. Elbert E. Youngs had been vested with full authority to represent the Dawson County Fair Association, as follows: </seg>

Besident Rudge: The motion just carried, as to the report of the ttee, and let them continue and report further on. That motion ed a few minutes ago. Mr. McArdle: Just so they continue outside, and we go on with some other business, we don't care. Kssident Rudge: If there is no objection we will allow the com - to continue their matters and make a report later on. (No objer - .de.) The next order of business. I think, is the President's report. President Rudge thereupon read the following report: THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT. To the Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture gather year has passed into history and with it are recorded the acts Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, and we trust that our efforts ;hten the agriculturist are appreciated by the people of our state. Id be our aim in future years to grow in strength and usefulness to nufacturing industries as well as the agriculturist. Bit efforts have been to encourage and educate the farmer whereby ild increase the yield from his farm from year to year, and we must ue along this line, for by comparing our yield with those of foreign ies we have much room for Improvement I he boundless extent of fertile unoccupied land is gone; each year e consuming more of our products and exporting less. The United i with the most fertile soil in the world, but with its wasteful, slip - method of seed selection and cultivation, produces an average of only fourteen bushels of wheat to the acre, whereas England ces more than thirty-two bushels and the Netherlands more than four bushels. Of oats, the United States produces an average annual of 23 7/10 bushels per acre; England forty-two bushels; Germany </seg>
            <seg id="p014">&gt;r forty-aix bushels; and the Netherlands fifty-three bushels per acre. Of potatoes the average annual yield is eighty-five bushels per acre, while that of Germany, Belgium, and Great Britain is two hundred and fifty bushels per acre. Are not these facts startling and discreditable? As they are suggestive of very serious thought, what are we to do? One hundred yean ago the average production of Great Britain was about the same as our present yield. A royal commission (which is still in existence, was appointed, a campaign of education was entered upon, and today the farms of the United Kingdom, tilled for centuries in a climate less favorable than ours, produce over thirty-two bushels of wheat per acre All this is self-evident that we must continue the agriculture education with more vigor than in the past; as with the soil, sunshine, and moisture in Nebraska we should stand at the top of the ladder, and be an example to other less favored countries and states. State Fair. The three days of rain during our 1909 Fair reduced our attendance about thirty thousand, which resulted in a much smaller balance in our treasury than has been in the past three or four years The Secretary's report will give you a complete statement of the receipts and disbursements for the past year. Permanent Improvements. In the past year we have placed the following permanent improve- ments on the Pair Grounds: Two show pavilions in Swine Department at a cost of $1,350 00 New fence around outside of race track 700 00 New shed for forage 250 00 1600 feet new sewer. 330 00 New water mains, fire plug, and water meter. . 1,150 00 New floor in Educational Hall 350 00 New shelving in Agricultural Hall . . . 600 00 New toilet building in Machinery Department 600 00 Expense filling ground 756 00 Moving two cattle barns, remodeling same for horses 600 00 New cement walks around Auditorium 396 00 New roof on Mercantile Hall 720 00 Plans for Live Stock Coliseum 500 00 Cinders for walks and driveways 538 00 Making a total expended for permanent improvements the P«t year $8,840 00 </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 Live Stock Coliseum One year ago we introduced a bill in the Legislature asking for $115,000 to build a Live Stock Coliseum. We were favored with an ap - propriation of $50,000, and it being Impossible to build a $115,000 build - ing with only $50,000, your Board of Managers decided to build and com - plete only one-half of the building at this time. At first the building progressed very slowly on account of the difficulty in securing a good foundation for the walls, but since the last Fair it has progressed very satisfactorily and will be completed and ready for occupancy by the Exhibits. Too much praise cannot be given to our exhibitors for the show and display made at the past Fair, which exceeded any previous one and in many ways was far superior to those of our neighboring states. Class A. — Horses Under the supervision of J. A. Ollis, Jr., was by far the largest and best exhibit we have ever had. all the barns being filled and classes well represented, and the time is not far distant when we should provide more complete and commodious quarters for this department. Class B. — Cattle. Kuch credit is due Superintendent O. E. Mickey and his able assist - i. R. Danielson, for the greatest cattle show west of the Missouri The new barn was comfortably filled, and the long row of Short - and Herefords that were brought out in the ring would be a credit International Show at Chicago. Class C — Swine, Mr. George Leonard in charge, and L. W. Leonard as assistant, was well conducted, as in this department the entries are mnch larger than in other live stock classes. The exhibit, while not as large numerically as last year, was of a much better quality, and more animals were for exhibition purpose than in former years. Class D. — Sheep, Eaa. McLeod, Superintendent, was up to its usual standard. Ex &gt; seem well pleased with treatment received, and we trust an te gets older and more sheep are raised that we may be able to e this department and make a larger showing than in the past. Class E. — Poultry, Mr. A. H. Smith. Superintendent, was very complete, nearly all (Imw being filled and a much larger variety of birds were shown this year </seg>
            <seg id="p016">than former years. This department is much in need of permanent coops to display the birds and which would make a much better looking exhibit. Class F. — Farm Products. — Wm. James, Superintendent. Elt has been often said the right man In the right place will always ke a success, and we certainly have him in this department. For no « in the past has Agicultural Hall had as attractive and good a play as was put up at our last Fair, and after visiting other state ■s and comparing their agriculture exhibit with ours, we are as far tad of them as our exhibit of today compares with our exhibit of twenty irs ago. Class G. — Dairy Product. — W. F. Johnson, Superintendent. Shis department we have a fine display made by the Beatrice Cream - nd I am sorry to say it is the only attractive and interesting ex - and that has been the case for a number of years, so there is no dit on the Superintendent, but more so on the Board of Managers, imething radical should be done to bring this exhibit up to compare ither classes. Class H. — Domestic Product. — Mrs. R. A. Maloney, Superintendent. The entries in this department were up to its usual number, and much credit is due the Superintendent for the manner they were dis - played, as the quarters and fixtures for this department are very crude, and they should be provided with larger and better facilities for making an attractive display. Class I. — Bees and Honey. — W. W. Cole, Superintendent. ■"his department was ably looked after and shows improvement former years. They could use more space and are very much In of a better building. Class J. — Women's Department. — Mrs. C. A. Mansfield, Superintendent. tthis class we have the greatest number of entries and by far the number of articles on exhibition, and we are under lasting obli - to Mrs. Mansfield for the ability shown in the management of this This display is entitled to more room, and I trust before another tens we may be able to provide it. Class K. — Fine Arts. — Mrs. Ross B. Curtice, Superintendent. Els department shows much Improvement, which is largely das . Curtice and the former superintendent, Mrs. Hall, and It will a new building for this class before we can look for any la- I showing in fine arts. Class L. — Educational.— Mr. E C.

            <seg id="p017">a buildimg 50x100 feet, and could use much more room if we had It to spare, and we owe much to Mr. Bishop for his energy and push in bring - ing this department to its present size. Class M. — Machinery. — Joseph Roberts, Superintendent, The largest display on the ground, and one that requires a man of good judgment to handle, and we find the present superintendent fully equal to the occasion. The exhibit the past year was in better shape than former years on account of some of the exhibitors having put up perma - nent buildings to display their vehicles and implements. Class Q. — Special. — Mr. Chas. Mann, Superintendent. We are sure of this being well cared for, when Mr. Mann has It In charge, and his duties of looking after the Feed and Forage Department assist much in helping to accommodate our exhibitors. Class 8. — Speed, Will be touched upon in our Secretary's report Horticulture. This exhibit is made by and managed by the Nebraska State Horti - culture Society and shows a large amount of labor and effort on their part in making the Horticulture show one of the most attractive on the ground, and we trust the day is not far distant when we can furnish them a building that would be a credit for the good show they put up. To Exhibitors. The Nebraska State Board of Agriculture desire to express their appreciation to all exhibitors through whose efforts we were able to make the largest and best Fair ever held in Nebraska. Officers and Members. Efore retiring from the office of President I wish to thank all the and members for the loyal support given me, for it is only by d and wise council that we can expect to continue to grow. Trusting my efforts have met with your approval, I remain, Your obedient servant. C. H. RUDGE, President Eesldent Rudge: It has been suggested that before we hear the reports that it would be well to have the nominations to fill the :ies on the Board, for the reason that we can get the tickets printed night. It Is quite a saving of expense, if we have to hare the </seg>
            <seg id="p018">B printed for tomorrow. So if there is no objection to this method 1 change the regular order of business and receive the nominations time to fill vacancies on the Board created by the members whose of office expire at this time. Any remarks? ■ecretary Mellor: It might be well to pass around the premium lists ich the names of the members whose terms of office expire at this appear. President Rudge: Now, if there is any objection whatever to a change of this kind, we would like to hear from the members. Secretary Mellor: I would suggest now, that tonight at 6:00 o'clock you are all invited to meet with us at the Commercial Club rooms for lunch. President Rudge: Dinner. Secretory Mellor: Well, dinner, is it? President Rudge: Sure. (Laughter.) Iicretary Mellor: Well, dinner; and also to talk over matters of it to county fairs. I think that this meeting will be productive of erable good to the county fairs of the state of Nebraska, and I hope very president and every secretary of an organization represented rill be present with us at 6:00 o'clock, in addition to all the mem - if the State Board of Agriculture. The Commercial Club rooms the Fraternity Building, just across the street and down at the corner from the IJndell Hotel, 13th and M streets. Mr. Haws: Mr. Harmes is president of the Franklin County Agri - cultural Society. He has no credentials, claiming that he received no notice of this meeting. Perhaps the secretary has not notified him. Secretary Mellor: I don't know. Is Franklin county represented? Mr. McLeod: John Harmes is given here as representative. Secretary Mellor: He doesn't need any credentials as long as he Is president. Are there any nominations? Motion to proceed to the nominations to fill vacancies put and carried. President Rudge: Nominations are in order. Kr. Mickey: Excuse me, just a mement, Mr. President. Would be well. Secretary Mellor, to place up there the number of members D out from each congressional district? Secretary Mellor: We will do that after the nominations are made. LIST OF NOMINATIONS.

President Rudge: If it goes with the — Mr. Wilson: If it carries with it, if he receives sufficient votes to have elected him if there were three candidates to be elected. I didn't quite understand the wording. President Rudge: There are but three nominations anyhow. There are three nominations and three places to be filled. EC McArdle: It is immaterial if there were one hundred running. an that is third highest is elected for the short term. It is im - al what the vote Is; whether it is a majority or not. That allows o higher than him to fill the long terms, and places him where ongB. Mr. Wilson: The point I make is this: if there were a number running and there were not sufficient to elect any of them, under this motion the man receiving the third highest would, under this rule, be elected, even though numbers one and two were not elected. Secretary Mellor: The motion should be. third highest and a ma - jority; that is what it should be. President Rudge: That is the way I would like to hear the motion. Secretary Mellor: I amend to make it the third highest and a majority. (Seconded.) Br. McArdle: It wasn't customary. We didn't do that last year idn't go according to the majority of the votes cast You gave President Rudge: If we didn't that is a mistake Kr. McArdle: You didn't think that last year. It was the highpst There were men elected last year that received only twenty vot*-s. make that rule my motion is out of order. If you stick to the old ent made last year it is strictly in order. Secretary Mellor: It Is a motion; it has been made and seconded. Evident Rudge: Gentlemen, you have heard the amendment to the The gentleman receiving the third highest vote from that dis - declared the man elected for the short term, and that being the y of the votes cast. Are there any rpmarks? ■r. McArdle: Yes. Mr. President. Wouldn't it be a good idea that of the men receiving the majority of all the ballot, that is, only in that district.

Ream; It seems to me the original motion covered the ground *ely. Of course, the one receiving the highest number of votes district would be considered elected in that district; and if there ree to be elected from that district the third receiving the highest r of votes from that district would certainly be considered duly ary Mellor: That is if it was a majority of the votes cast President Rudge: Gentlemen, you will vote on the amendment A Member: What is the amendment? President Rudge: The amendment is that those receiving the highest number of votes, and that being a majority of the votes cast, will be de - clared elected. Kr. Woods: As this gentleman says, I think that the three elected one district, the third receiving the highest votes might cause 1 ballots. President Rudge: That is what we are here for Mr. Wood: I know we are here for that purpose, but it might nece* - sarily call for several ballots. Why not vote as heretofore, thoi-- ■ig the highest number of votes? I am not a stickler for that point, believe that would be a fair thing to do. K. Roberts: Supposing under that rule there would be one candi om a district and only one nomination from the district, and only 'inber to fill it, supposing the members did not vote for that man; strict then wouldn't be represented, would it? ry Mellor: You might suppose you died before you voted, too. Br. Roberts: They could keep the votes from that man if they I to get him out, and that district would not be represented. President Rudge: This is not likely to happen B. Woods: That might happen, but it isn't probable that it would. t, but it isn't probable that it would. Mr. Hendershot: Leaving out about the majority of the vote* cast makes it possible for a man to do a little "cute" work. For instance, Mr. Roberts is a candidate up in his county, and I am a candidate down in Thayer. I will get three or four fellows up in his district to nominate two or three other men while I have only got one from down in Thayer county, and his friends will be divided. I may not be the man for the place, yet I will receive more votes for the place than Mr. Roberts, be - cause I have got two or three men from up in his neighborhood. It makes It possible to elect the wrong man. This other way it makes It very easy, if there should be a little tie-up, to change the rule. I think it is a good thing. An ounce of prevention is worth a whole pound of cure, and I am in favor of the motion, Mr. Wilson: I think the objection which is raised is not good for thli reason: They are elected by diitricU, and unless the candidate U </seg>

Mr. Hendershot: I mean in the same district, of course. The dis - tricts are large. I might be in the same district with Mr. Roberts. While I am not, I am just taking that for example. If I wanted to, and I should be a candidate against him, 1 could go around and get Mr. Roberts' friends to get other men nominated in that district. He would have three candidates in his end of the district, and there would be only one in my end of the district, and in that way I would be elected.

We will now to the reading of the report of our Secretary- Secretary Mellor thereupon read the following report SECRETARY'S REPORT. To the Officers and Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: The year 1909 has passed into history with its joys and sorrow*, its conquests and defeats, its successes and failures. Farming, In the main has been quite satisfactory. Crops have not been record-breaker* in yield, but have touched the high mark in prices obtained. The trend of </seg>
            <seg id="p023">our people as in past years has been city-ward, and away from the farm, and so long as this condition prevails, coupled with a prosperous country. we can look for advancing prices. We must have more producers before we can have lower prices, as the demand is increasing while the supply is proportionately diminishing. On August 1, Nebraska had the finest prospect for a record-breaking corn crop ever promised at that date, but the continuous dry hot weather of the entire month played havoc with our yield, which dwindled from a prospective 250 million bushels to 170 million. The small grain crop was about normal in yield with advancing prices. LJve stock prices have continued to advance, and are now higher than at any time since 1886. Nebraska lands continue to advance in price. which advance is causing a number of our people to purchase cheaper land elsewhere. We wish to again remind our citizens that there are no investments elsewhere to compare with Nebraska investments. Do not make the mistake of piling up a bill of trouble and expense in the purchasing of foreign real estate — buy it where you can attend to it at a nominal expense, and under personal supervision. Statistics. The State Bureau of Statistics have issued the following compilation as to the total yield of our principal crops for the year 1909. Acreage. Yield. Value. Corn 6,477,282 169,179,137 $98,123,171 Wheat (Winter) 2,306,385 46,444,735 41,800.261 Wheat (Spring) .. 257.944 3,868,865 3.481.973 Oats 2,359,395 59,653,479 23,861.389 Barley . . 128,358 2,820,632 1,2(9477 Rye 70,640 1,227,332 736.399 Alfalfa 615,329 1,971,770 17,745,930 Wild hay 3,257,096 4,252,430 29,767.010 Tame hay 1,254,997 2,647,839 21,182.712 Potatoes 105,005 8,024.173 6,427.341 Minor crops 10,660,000 165.045,463 Poultry products 18,732,436 Dairy products 36.74S.fi* 862,327 horses 82,781,392 80,301 mules 8,030,100 2,619.730 cattle 62,873,120 1,780.683 hogs 21.SC8.1M 261.696 sheep 1,177.632 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">B&gt;nsideration of this wonderful showing of Nebraska's resources, we for a moment to observe that the above figures do not take Into t land values, merchandise, machinery, vehicles, household goods, uents, and numerous other items of value. Stock-Yards. Owing to the fact that Nebraska has within its borders the third largest stock-yards in the United States, it would hardly be fair to include the immense business done by this company in exclusive statistics of this suite. During the year the total receipt of stock at South Omaha, has been 1,124,618 cattle, 2,135,493 hogs, 2,167.014 sheep, and 31,711 horses and mules. The total shipment of stock from the yards has been 373,908 cattle, 277,891 hogs, 959.034 sheep, and 28,817 horses and mules. The grand total of stock handled since the establishment of the yards twenty-six years ago is 109,237.892 head. Corn. The report of the State Bureau of Statistics for the Trade Review gives the total corn crop of Nebraska for the year 1909 at 169,179.137 bushels, a decrease in round numbers of 9 million bushels from the previous year. The government estimate for the year 1909 is 196,565,000 bushels, a much higher figure than that given by the state bureau, but a decrease of almost exactly the same amount— 9 millions — from the crop of 1908. The crop of 1909, according to the State Bureau of Statistics, which figures will be used in the discussion and comparison of the crops this year, are almost exactly the same as those for the crop of 1907, the exact figures for the 1907 crop being 169,732,885. It will be seen, therefore, that not - withstanding the fear of a short corn crop this year It is, taking the state as a whole, practically equal to the crop for the last two years. A comparison of acreage shows that the present year there was an acreage of corn in Nebraska of 6,477.282, compared with an acreage one year ago of 6,339,019, so there is an increase of acreage with a little lighter crop the present year. The average yield of corn this year, taking the entire state over, is 26.7, as against a yield one year ago per acre the state over of 28.17, while the average yield in 1907 was 2S.76. The value of th« corn crop of this state, however, for the present year la larger than for the year 1908, notwithstanding a shortage of 9 million bushels In yield. The value of the corn crop in 1908 was $89,299,798. The value of the com crop this rear la $98,048,460. . The corn crop of the present year Is widely different in this state from Agricultural products 255,045.463 Oalry and poultry products 56,478,036 [Jve stock 176,132.440 Bank deposits, November 30. d'j 186,080,005 Total $672,735,944 </seg>
            <seg id="p025">the fact that in the North Platte country the crop is above an average, while in the South Platte country the crop is far below the normal yield. This has greatly changed the record of counties standing highest in pro - duction, and some of the counties biggest in territory and acreage have fallen out of this list, while smaller counties have come decidedly to the front. In first place in the corn crop of 1909 stands Cedar county, with a total production of 5,421.895 bushels, an average yield of 42.5 bushels per acre. In second place is Saunders county, with a yield of 5,141,138 bushels and an average yield per acre of 31.3 bushels. Cuater occupies third place with 4,987,615, an average yield of 24.1 per acre. In fourth place Antelope county stands with 4,566,370 bushels production; and the high average yield of 37.6 bushels per acre. Lancaster county is in fifth place with 4,486,912 bushels and the very low average yield of 17.5 bushels per acre. Last year Custer occupied first place, Lancaster county second place, and Saunders county third place. This year Cedar and Antelope counties come to the front with the other three counties named above. Last year Valley county had an average production of 45 bushels per acre; this year Cedar county leads with 42.5 bushels per acre. Wheat. The winter wheat crop of Nebraska for the year 1909 is the largest in volume of production in three years, the crop this year amounting to the total of 46,444,735 bushels, an average yield the state over of 20.13. This crop has been raised on a smaller acreage than the crop of one year ago, and the yield per acre in 1908 was 17 bushels per acre. In 1907 the yield of winter wheat in Nebraska was 18.55 per acre, while in 190fi, the banner winter wheat crop year for the state, the yield was 24 bushels per acre. Last year the value of the wheat crop of Nebraska was $37,265,832; this year the value of the crop is $43,659,174. For the comparison, while the crop of this year is over 6 million bushels less than 1906, the much greater value of this year's crop is shown in the fact that the big crop of 1906, at the market price then, was only $29,503,085. E.eir order of production the first leading counties in winter wheat ! year 1909 were Adams, with a production of 2,058,637 bushels; on county in second place with a production of 2,046,349 bushels; county in third place with 1,884,600 bushels; Clay county fourth list with a crop of 1,881,915 bushels, and York county holding fifth a production with a crop of 1,600,555 bushels. Last year the three ; counties in wheat production were in their order, Clay, Adams, Lmilton. The following counties in Nebraska raised over a million bushels each of winter wheat: Adams, Buffalo, Butler, Clay, Fill more, Qage, Hall. Hamilton, Harlan, Kearney, Lancaster, Nuckolls, Phelps, Platte, Polk. Saline, Saunders, Seward. and York. The lint three counties in yield of winter wheat in bushel* per acre were Deuel, Scotts Bluff, and Cheyenne. While these counties produced a small amount ot winter </seg>
            <seg id="p026">wheat, their big average yield of over thirty bushels to the acre shows the possibility of western Nebraska in growing winter wheat and also the way the area of winter wheat is expanding in the state. The spring wheat crop of Nebraska, that has declined since the coining of winter wheat, amounted in 1909 to 3,868,865 bushels, grown on 257,944 acres of ground, the average yield for the state being 15 bushels per acre. The leading county in the production of spring wheat was Cheyenne, with 414,863 bushels, and this county also stands at the head in the yield of spring wheat, the average yield in that county being 27.5 bushels Oat*. One of the largest crops of oats produced in Nebraska in recent years was the crop of 1909, amounting to 59,653,479 bushels. In comparison with this high yield the oat crop of Nebraska in 1908 was 56,163,528 bushels, and the oat crop of 1907 in Nebraska was 53,622,262 bushels. While the price of oats is a little below that of a year ago, the additional heavy yield has brought the total value of the oat crop of Nebraska for 1909 to $23,861,391, as against a value for the crop of 1908 of $22,465,396. The total acreage of 1909 for the oat crop of Nebraska was 2,359,395, an in - crease in acreage of 6,000 acres in round numbers. In the production of oats for 1909 Knox county stands in first place with a crop of 1,941,375 bushels. Platte county is in second place with 1,880,982 bushels. Cedar county la In third place with 1,775,554 bushels. Saunders is in fourth place with 1,716,838; and Madison in fifth place with 1.715,452 bushels. One year ago the three highest counties in the production of oats in their order were Platte, Cedar, and Custer. There were some high yields per acre in the oat crop of 1909, and again the western counties take the lead in this line, with Cheyenne county first, with an average yield of 54 bushels per acre, and Deuel county second with an average yield of 51 bushels to the acre. Some remarkably high yields are reported from the irrigated lands in Scottsbluff county, but the high average by counties as a whole go to Cheyenne and Deuel. Barley. Nebraska produced in 1909, 2.820,632 bushels of barley from 128.358 acres, an average yield of 22 bushels per acre. In 1908 the production of barley was lighter than for 1909, the total bushels last year being 2,131,793, with practically the same acreage. Barley production is hardly maintaining a general average in volume during the last ten years, al - though prices have ruled high for whatever of the crop has gone to market In their order the following were the leading counties In the production of barley for 1909: In first place, Hitchcock county, with 349.933 bushels; Dundy holds second place with 211,740, and Red Willow third place, with 144,609 bushels; Hayes in fourth place with 141.910 bushels, and Box Butte fifth in the list with 117,447 bushels. It will be noted that the barley production is confined very largely to the southwest </seg>
            <seg id="p027">counties of the state; and the two first counties in the production of barley in 1909 were the two high counties in 1908. Rye. The rye crop of Nebraska continues to make a declining record, the production in bushels for 1909 being 1,227,332 bushels, 1,266,448 in 1908. and 1.407,699 bushels in 1907. Going back to the year 1905 Nebraska produced 2.200.998 bushels of rye, and that volume of production has never been reached since that time. The decline in acreage is fairly in proportion to the decline In bushels. The leading rye counties in their order for 1909 were: Cheyenne, Lincoln, Holt, Brown, and Keya Paha. The high yield for rye for 1909 goes to Gage county with an average yield of 40 bushels to the acre. Alfalfa. No product of the soil in Nebraska has shown greater development or wider expansion in the last ten years than alfalfa. This marvelously profitable crop found in this state a waiting field. At first it was sup - posed that Irrigation was necessary for the production of this farm prod - uct. Later it was found that through the central and eastern parts of Nebraska that the crop did equally well under natural conditions, in the last few years It has developed that in the high semi-arid section of the state that alfalfa will grow and thrive. Nebraska, therefore, has only just commenced in the development of this most profitable of all crops. In the year 1909 that has just closed Nebraska produced, from 615,329 acres, 1,971,770 tons of alfalfa in addition to all that was fed when the crop was growing. This 1909 crop of alfalfa is worth $23,661,140. There la nearly one hundred thousand more acres in 1909 than in 1908, and owing to both a heavier yield and higher prices, the value of the alfalfa crop of Nebraska in 1909 was nearly one-third larger than the previous year. In their order of production of alfalfa the first five counties in the state, with their tons produced, are as follows: Daw son. 122.300; Custer, 105,441; Buffalo, 98,543; Webster, 70,791; Boone, 70,2»4. The following Illustrates the growth of alfalfa production in Nebraska in the last eight years. Production Acreage.

            <seg id="p028">H.y. The magnitude of the hay crop of Nebraska ii largely neglected and overlooked in the fact of the great yield of the more popular moneyed crops; but Nebraska produces an enormous crop of both wild and tame hay, and under high ruling prices for this forage the hay crop of 1909 was worth $59,258,712; worth more than the entire wheat crop of the state, and worth over half the amount of the corn crop of the state. In the year 1909 Nebraska produced 2,647,839 tons of tame hay from 1,254.997 acres. In 1909 Nebraska produced 4,252,430 tons of wild hay from 3,267.096 acres. The five leading counties in the production of tame hay in their order are: Cuming, Wayne, Cass, Saunders, and Dodge. The five leading counties in the state in the production of wild hay are: Cherry, Holt, Lancaster, Madison, and Harlan. Potatoes. As a potato-producing state Nebraska has advanced by leaps and bounds In the last few years and in the northwest counties of this state is found one of the greatest potato countries in the nation. In 1909 this state produced 8,024,173 bushels of potatoes from 105,005 acres, an average yield of a little over 76 bushels per acre for the entire state. In their order the following are the five counties ranking highest In the production of potatoes, with the number of bushels produced by each: Sheridan, 719,640; Box Butte, 382,656; Scottsbluff, 346,500; Brown, 248,600; Lan - caster, 243,200. The highest average yield in any single county in the state was in Deuel county, where potatoes made an average yield of 150 bushels to the acre. The Banner Counties in Production. Prom the foregoing summary It will be noticed that the following counties are the banner counties in the state, holding first place in the production of different crops as follows: Ki, Cedar county; wheat, Adams county; oats, Knoz county; rye, nne county; barley, Hitchcock county; alfalfa, Dawson county; hay, Cuming county; wild hay, Cherry county; potatoes, Sheridan It la generally conceded that the land suitable for profitable agriculture in Nebraska is now practically all in use; therefore in order to increase the agricultural output it is necessary to realize greater yields. This Is a matter for serious consideration, which heretofore haa created a demand for experimental stations in different parts of the state. We confidently believe that the yield of crop production will be nearer perfection if each county poor farm be made an experiment station, under the control of an experienced, scientific agriculturist, for whose serrlces the county and state might share equally in expense. These expert! could be obtained from among the young man taking the long </seg>
            <seg id="p029">term course in our School of Agriculture, and would furnish a means of providing funds for worthy young men to secure additional agri - cultural knowledge. It is a well-known fact that people II ring twenty miles away from an object lesson receive very little benefit, from the fact that in the busy season they have very little time or opportunity to learn what is taking place out of their limited range of vision. Their time and attention must of necessity be devoted to home Iaboi3; therefore the nearer we can bring proper methods in agriculture to them, the greater their profit. In addition to the county farm experiment station, the time will come in Nebraska when each school district will have from one to five acres of an experiment station, to be scientifically worked by the scholars as a part of their schooling, for which proper credits will be given. This will create the ideal method, as the father and mother who have charge of the work on the farm throughout the day will hare daily instruction from that gathered by the children along timely, prac - tical lines, ultimately resulting in love of farm life, a growth and retention of farmers for the future added fertility to the soil, and wealth to the The University Farm. Within the past year the University has organized its Industrial College into a College of Agriculture and a College of Engineering. This will enable the teaching of agriculture in the University to be brought more prominently before the people, not only offering an opportunity for young men to secure an education fitting them to live upon the land and make the most of a life in the country but also offering opportunities for young men to fit themselves for responsible positions as teachers in colleges and secondary schools, workers in experiment stations, and managers of extensive farms. The demand for agricultural education in secondary schools is increas - ing from year to year, and the educational system of Nebraska and other states is adapting itself to these new demands so rapidly that tha demand for teachers of agriculture in secondary schools is likely to exceed the supply. The demand for thoroughly trained men in agricultural science is so great at the present time that any thoroughly trained man has no dif - ficulty whatever in securing a remunerative position witu promise of promotion as he becomes efficient in his work. The results of agricultural investigation in experiment stations have also led to a considerable demand for demonstration farms, especially in new and undeveloped sections of the country, to determine what crops and what methods will succeed in these new regions, and educated men to fill these positions are continually in demand. The School of Agriculture has prospered during the past year and has maintained its normal increase in growth, indicating that the farmers and farmers' sons still rely upon this school as a meads of securing technical knowledge to aid them in their practical farm operations. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">The permanent improvements at the University Farm for the current year hare been small, and consist mainly in the establishment of a private water plant, the erection of greenhouses to be used in growing stock for campus decorations, and the development of a systematic plan of decoration for the University and Farm campus. It is to be hoped that money to build one or more of the four much-needed buildings at the farm will be supplied by the next Legislature, so that facilities for ln- Ectlon may grow with the Increase in students and the demand for cultural instruction. The University Farm maintained its reputation for its knowledge In practical cattle feeding by winning several prizes at the International Live Stock Exposition at Chicago, including the champion two-year-old beef carcass, the champion yearling beef carcass, and the grand champion beef carcass of the show. Three of the twenty scholarships offered by Mr. Armour to the agricultural colleges, to be awarded according to the money prices won in open competition in the show came to Nebraska. The students of the University also upheld the honor and reputation of the state by winning, at the International Dairy Show at Milwaukee, Wis., October 15, 1909, the Holstein-Friesian cup as the best judges of Holstein cattle, and Hoard's Dairyman cup as the best judges of all breeds of dairy cattle, and the grand champion prize as the best all-round judges of dairy cattle; also, a member of the team, Mr. Will Forbes, won the first prise in individual judging of all breeds, first in Jerseys, first in Holsteins, and second in Ayrshires. It is granted that the promotion of agricultural education in all Its branches makes for the upbuilding of the state. Farmers' Institutes. Bug the past year 144 Farmers' Institutes were held, 36 of which or one day, and 108 for two or more days; 86,621 people attended meetings, and 37 speakers were used; 3,000 reports were printed e total expense was $10,000. Two short courses, each of a week's », were held at Broken Bow and Hebron. This year arrangements have been made for the holding of 150 institutes, and six short courses — to be held at Cambridge, Blair, Beatrice, Broken Bow, Hebron, and Franklin. This Board furnishes each institute with a supply of the Agricultural Year Books for distribution. Weather Bureau Perhaps the most important work the Weather Bureau does is the issuing of a weather forecast each day. That this forecast is of practical value to those who understand it has been demonstrated over and over again. It Is equally certain that to those who do not understand it it is of little value. Therefore, at the present time efforts are being made to explain the forecast to the people as well as to inform them how It can be obtained promptly. The forecast can be obtained by practically </seg>
            <seg id="p031">31 E'ho have a telephone, free of expense, delivered in the forenoon containing the indications of the weather for that night and the day. A daily weather map is now sent to a very large proportion of the schools in the state for use by the teachers in instructing the pupils u to the basis, nature, and reliability of the forecast A knowledge of the local climate will enable a person to make better oae of his energies along all lines, as well as to interpret the weather forecast more Intelligently. Rain gages and thermometers are loaned to a large number of people in the state to enable us to determine the climate more accurately. This has proved a decided advantage to those keeping the record and to the large number of people who are Interested in, and anxious to know, what they may expect, especially in temperature and rainfall, in the various parts of the state. Veterinary Department. In co-operation with the United States Bureau of Animal Industry during the year 1909, our Deputy State Veterinarian has tested 6,028 cattle for tuberculosis. Of that number 5,241 passed the test as in perfect condition, while 787 reacted to the test and were thus found to be af - fected. It was found that the greatest per cent of tubercular, reacting cattle were those confined in close, unsanitary quarters, and affected the dairy and pure bred cattle, which are housed the greater part of the time, to a much greater extent than ordinary breeding stock accustomed to wind-break or shed protection. ■ the dairy cattle supplying the Omaha trade, about 30 per cent have found affected, while those coming from the western part of the to the South Omaha stock yards were singularly free from disease. Stallion Law. The 1909 Legislature passed a new stallion law, compelling owners of registered stallions to secure state certificates of registration, based upon the original certificate obtained from an association recognised by the United States Department of Agriculture. This permits every breeder to secure the knowledge as to the pure breeding of the stallion. Under this law 339 certificates have been sent in for registration, all except twelve of which proved to be genuine. Pure Food Commission. Is work of the Food Commission for the past year has been conducted the educational line, especially as to proper branding of package i. Samples of various articles of food have been gathered and very adulterations have been found. There have been cases of mis - ling that have come to the attention of the department which were i up with the manufacturers, and in almost every case the manu - rer has been willing to comply with the rulings of the department. </seg>
            
            <seg id="p032">The inspectors have also been gathering samples of standard drugs from the various drug stores in the state, and in many oases have found them below the standard recognized in the United States Pharmacopoeia. In October the Commission adopted a sanitary score card for all grocery stores, restaurants, hotels, bakeries, butcher shops, saloons, and drug stores. These score cards are filled out by the inspectors and mailed to the department, where they are placed in a filing case, and any person asking for a duplicate card is furnished one by the department. The dairy inspectors have been busy inspecting dairies, cream-receiving stations, and creameries. There have been two convictions for manipula - tion of tests, and there are three cases pending. These five cases are against persons acting as operators of cream-receiving stations. There has been one prosecution and conviction for the use of formaldehyde In milk. The dairy inspectors make daily reports of creameries, cream stations, and dairies inspected as to sanitation. Census. The first census taken in the United States was in 1790. It is said that at that time Sweden was the only country in the world having taken an enumeration of its people. In this country, agriculture did not enter into census returns until 1850. although in 1839 Congress appropriated $1,000 at the behest of Hon. H. L. Ellsworth for the purposes of seed Jlstribu - tion, prosecuting agricultural investigation, and procuring agricultural statistics. This event may be termed the beginning of our great agricultural department at Washington, which, in 1909, upon the request of Secretary James Wilson, received from Congress $12,995,000 for ex - penditure In the department which now employs over 10,000 persons. During this year of 1910, our general census is taken, and the farm inventory Is called for by the decision of Congress as of April 15. B usual for manufacturers and merchants to take an annual ln - y of their stock, but very unusual for farmers. Therefore con - ile effort will be necessary to secure reliable data. L&lt;et us urge loyal Nebraska farmer, who has the interest of our state at heart, an accurate list of his farm property required which will include — 1. Total value of the farm with all Improvements 2. Value of all buildings. 3. Value of all implements and machinery. 4. Number and value of all animals. 5. Number and value of poultry over three months old 6. Number and value of swarms of bees In addition to the above each farm operator will be required to give quantity and value of crops of 1909. The securing of reliable data is a matter of great moment to Nebraska. as from the results of this census Nebraska will be Judged for ten years to come. Let us all put our shoulder to the wheel and help to overcome any prejudice which may impair the truthful results. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">Farmer Clubs' Literature A year ago it was thought advisable to branch out in a new line, that of furnishing reading articles to Farmers' Clubs. We prepared and furnished forty-nine applicants with a constitution and bylaws for such a club and sent reading articles to each, also to the country press as follows: March 1. an article on the "Germination of Seed Corn," with instructions for making the germinating box and testing of the seed. April 1, an article on the "Preparation of Seed Bed for Corn Planting." "Preparation for Oats," and "How to Kill Gophers in Alfalfa Fields"; May 1, "Corn Cultivation." and "Poultry Mites"; June 1. "Alfalfa"; July 1, "Finishing Corn Cultivation"; August 1, "When to Sow Alfalfa," and "Fall Plowing"; September 1, "Good Roads," and "Selecting Seed Corn Boys' Corn Contest During the year 1909 this Board offered premiums amounting to $150 to boys under eighteen years of age for the largest number of bushels of corn produced from a single acre, to be prepared, planted, cultivated. and gathered by the contestant. Ninety-eight boys entered according to the terms, and reports were finally received from eighteen, as follows: Name and P. O. Address. No. Lbs. Bu. Lbs. William A. Wiese.

            <seg id="p034">Peter Youngers, and myself as delegates to the various meetings held In Chicago about December 1. With the exception of Mr. Hendershot your committee attended these meetings, and at the meeting of the American Shorthorn Breeders' Association was instrumental in assisting to elect flve western men as directors, so that now, instead of only two directors west of the Mississippi, that stream divides the directorate as nearly equal as possible. One of the directors so elected was Governor A. C. Shallenberger. We also attended the meeting of the National Association of Fairs and Expositions, which recommended as our dates for 1910. September 5 to 9 inclusive, and also uniform classification and rules which are Included in the report of our revision committee. County Fairs S believe it is the province of this State Board of Agriculture to foster elfare of the county fair associations, representatives of which le ex-offlcio members of cur Board. From the reports received organizations are gradually growing less. Many of the counties commissioners, or supervisors, hostile to appropriations for their ;nance, and unless the officers have an excess amount of magnetism, ', and inclination for labor, it is a hard proposition to permanently uccessful county fairs without financial aid. From reports received d that 34 associations have held county fairs during the year 1909. 6 report, "no fair held." Can thi6 Board do anything to help these associations. In Iowa the state makes an appropriation based upon the amount of premiums paid by the association, with a maximum amount of $300 which maximum amount was received by only 3 out of the 88 counties holding fairs. The total sum paid for 1909 by the state was $19,060. Such a law seems a great incentive for the holding of county fairs, when 88 out of a total of 99 Iowa counties held fairs in 1909. This method is also followed by Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and other states with increased appropriations. If some legislative action could be had along this line in Nebraska, it would have a tendency to build up and foster county societies. To do this, these interests must secure representative, friendly men to run for legislative office, as new innovations are fields for hard fighting in which those imbued with the righteousness of the cause only can hope for success. We have contemplated the advisability of this Board making an appropriation out of Its funds, say, of 10 per cent of the amount of premiums paid, other than for speed, by county societies, up to $1,000, or some certain amount. By compiling the amount for premiums, we find that the county fairs of Nebraska last year paid out $20,921.77. The counties paying out more than $1,000 were Douglas, $2,925.32; Custer, $1,430.00; Boone, $1,310.00; Madison, $1,200.00. and Lancaster, $1,095.20. If this Board had given aid to the county fairs last year on this basis It would have cost us $1,796.11. If we were to offer this for the coming </seg>
            <seg id="p035">year it would probably be an Incentive for Injecting new life in slumbering societies, and the offering of better premiums all along the line, and might cost us In the neighborhood of $2,600.00. Would it be worth wall* for this Board to offer this assistance for the coming year? Would It have a tendency to organise, build up, and strengthen the Nebraska county fairs T Reports have been received for the year 1909 from county societies having held fairs, as follows: Boone, Boyd, Buffalo, Clay, Cuming, Cutter, Dawea, Dawson, Douglas, Flllmore, Franklin, Frontier, Furnas, Gaga, Oreeley, Hamilton, Harlan. Hitchcock, Holt, Johnson, Kearney, Keya Paha, Knox, Lancaster, Madison, Merrlck, Nuckolls, Pawnee, Red Willow, Saunders, Scottsbluff, Seward. Stanton, and Valley. </seg>

I ere are two sides to a Fair, the educational and the financial, though the financial side was a bit unsuccessful this year, certainly &gt;ud can be cast over the educational side. Under the various ments the magnitude of the show is thoroughly set forth and the ' Is directed to the various sections for specific figures." The "Twentieth Century Farmer" said: "Nebraska held Its forty-flrst annual State Fair last week on Its State Fair Grounds at Lincoln, under the most unfavorable weather conditions that have ever fallen to the lot of this Association. But notwithstanding the wet. cloudy, and dis - couraging situation, the work of the Fair moved steadily forward.

The crowds that left home and came to the Fair hoping that the rain would Boon be over, seemed to measure the situation in a philosophical war, that it could not be helped and no mortal influence was responsible for the unfair conditions that prevailed. "In all respects aside from the weather there has never been as good a showing made on these Fair Grounds. The departments all indicated improvement, more exhibits and better quality. The general tendency to development and a bettering of conditions, was a matter of remark by visitors. The Agricultural Hall was one of the centers of attraction. and has developed Into the greatest annual agricultural exhibition in the world. It is no longer a class of the usual state fair agricultural prod display. In extent of display it is from five to ten times greater than any other state fair in the United States. In quality, exhibition, taste, and arrangement it has no equal." I'allace's Fanner" among other remarks said: "The forty-flrst a.1 Nebraska State Fair was held in Lincoln last week, and so far ;hibits and entertainment was concerned, it was the most com; •ss in the history of the Association.

"The men In charge of the State Fair management are a gentlemanly lot and did everything in their power to make the fair a success and to give visitors a good, clean show and make them comfortable. As the Fair develops and some new permanent buildings are added to the present equipment, the Nebraska State Fair will gradually assume a standing and an Importance in keeping with the wonderful agricultural possibilities of the state. Much must be done in the way of better equipment, and the state legislature should help in this with liberal appropriations. Nothing will bring better returns to the state as a whole, both from an educational and advertising standpoint, than a couple hundred thousand dollars Invested in adequate permanent im - provements for the State Fair grounds. The Fair Association can do much in the war of minor Improvements, but it is too much to expect them to put up the larger buildings." Brould be possible for us to continue quotations of Ilka character "Kansas Farmer," "Orange-Judd Farmer," "Stock and Farm," Homestead," "The American Homestead" and other farm journals representatives were present, but time and space prevent. Eer, an editorial from the "Kansas Farmer" on the objects of fair covers Its purpose so well that we are pleased to repro- ' The state fair is full of interest and meets the wants of the city and country worker alike. It is the state on exhibition. It is a great showing of its products, manufactures, crops, live stock, machinery, minerals, and all the methods and processes by which the state has attained its position in the world. It is a great university which teaches by object lessons. It is the one place where the result of their labors may be seen. "The state fair is the advertising agent of the state. It Is the great •how-window of Its store of accomplishments, and what she h M to offer. It Is the exposition center of all the Interests and industries of the commonwealth, and it Is the place for the annual reunion of Its cltliens. To all of Its people the educational and social value of the state fair is unquestioned and unmeasured, but it has a patriotic doty as well. It is a duty which each citlien owes to himself, his family, his neighbors and his state to attend the Fair and see what is to be learned, touch elbows with his fellow men in the march of progress, and spend a meet profitable vacation."

The Legislature of 1901 appropriated $35,000 to purchase the present State Fair Grounds site, adjoining the city of Lincoln. In 1903 an appro - priation of $3,000 was made for a public comfort building; in 1905, $10,000 for a live stock pavilion; in 1907, $20,000 for a cattle barn hold- Ing 660 head; and there is now in course of construction one-half of a live stock judging coliseum, such as other states enjoy, for which the last legislature appropriated $50,000. Of the above sums, the state has paid out to date about a total of $76,000, and the State Board of Agri - culture, out of Its earnings at the various fairs, within the same period of time, has paid out a few dollars over $100,000. The 128 acres which comprise this tract of land is deeded to the itate of Nebraska. The land with the improvements is conservatively estimated at the present time as being worth about $250,000, property having steadily advanced since its purchase. The Fair is the show-window of the great storehouse of the state. Here its choicest animals, products, and manufactures are exhibited. Here Is the place to secure education in a shorter space of time, and at a less outlay, than at any school of learning in the land. This marks the beginning of desire for better herds, products, and machinery on the farm.

At no other place in the world can 60 much be seen for the money as at a state fair. There can be found the best animals of all the various desirable breeds, true to type. There are the best agricultural products. arranged in a manner pleasing to the eye. There are all the varieties, makes, and kinds of machinery, where those who desire may see a half - dozen different makes of the machine for the same purpose, shown by an expert, so that the particular kind adapted for the buyer's purpose can be judiciously selected. There the ladies may examine the wares of the textile, fine art, and domestic products departments, and how much enjoyment is secured to those connected or in sympathy with the schools of the state, in the examination of the educational display. Nebraska is said to excel every other state in the Union in its educational and agricultural display at the State Fair. With what pleasure and de - light Is viewed the fine exhibits of flowers, plants, and fruit displayed In Horticultural Hall; what an attraction the fish present at the Fisheries building to the thousands who annually visit this exhibit. What a vast amount of study or lectures it would take to acquire the knowledge gained at a glance as to the difference in the characteristics of the various exhibits made. When patrons grow tired of the educational features at the Fair, there are the amusement features, which attract from the fact that a ■election can be made for the specific kind which the beholder most thoroughly enjoys. A few steps takes one to the Auditorium, where one of the best bands and grand opera concert companies to be secured In the United States Is rendering programs from the world's best masters. If it is a contest of speed which is preferred, then the grandstand at the race track as a resting place is most alluring. In Nebraska, the enjoy - ment is marred only by a lack of seating space in the grandstand, which handicap we hope to remove soon. Occasionally we hear a complaint that the racing part of the State Fair costs too much money, or that more In proportion is offered than for any other department. This Is erroneous, as it Is seldom that tbe entry fees, grand stand receipts, and concession privileges do not more than foot the total expense, leaving the amount received from those who come for this specific sport at the ovts'de gate to apply on premiums and expenses.

President Rudge: There was a question we wanted to have brought up. K Brown: I thought without reading it there may be other similar we wanted to discuss. Mr. Ollis: I thought it would be a good thing to allow this part of the report to be read in full, because the part he has read are rules that have been adopted by the different state fairs, and the state fairs are all adopting those. The Iowa state fair will have the same rule in regard to the coupon ticket, — other states will have the same rule, so exhibitors will be working under the same rule in all the states. Eident Rudge: Mr. Ollis, may I ask you a question? Can you state gentlemen here whether this report increases the premium list uces it as from last year? And also tell them about the appropri - we are getting from the Shorthorn Association and how that vided.

Mr. Hendershot: Yes, sir. M. Graham: Well, I would like to see added to lots 4 and 6 a distinct variety of corn that is not given there. That is Northern White Cap. It it an early grown corn, and it Is becoming very much grown in the western part of the state. ■ Hendershot: What lot is that? Graham: Lots 4 and 6. B Hendershot: The committee has heard all the recommendations, are no objections. Mr. Mickey: Would it not be well to mention that in the Angus Mr. Hendershot: Pardon me. Let us finish the matter now under KvonForell: That corn is almost grown exclusively in our part of Lte, Scottsblufl county, with very good results. It seems to me would be well to add this variety. President Rudge: If there are no objections, then, that class will be added for the Northern White i_.ap in lots 4 and 6. Mr. Russell: While I think of it, I want to make a little explanation in regard to an Increase of $50 in Duroo-Jerseys. Some of the breeders of the other breeds will wonder why they are not increased, and I will explain. This was given by the American Duroc-Jersey Record Associa - tion, and it Is to be given only to hogs recorded in that association.

Some counties will require a longer space. A short county might make theirs big up and down and not so wide out, so we have scaled it down to 30 square feet. Mr. Johnson: Not to exceed that? Mr. Hendershot: Not to exceed that; yes, sir. President Rudge: Mr. Brown asked a question a while ago In regard to the exhibitor's tickets. I would like to ask If there is any objection to charging the $2 for the exhibitor's ticket. That is what is recommended by the Association of Pairs and Expositions. Mr. Brown: I think with the smaller exhibitors of horses there would be considerable objection. B Leonard: I think it would cut out a good many poor exhibits we want out.

All those in favor of this motion will signify by saying "Aye;" contrary, "No." Motion carried. Gentlemen, what is your further pleasure? Secretary Mellor: In relation to the matter of exhibitor's tickets the question that Mr. Brown raised. I desire to say that I was In a hopeless minority on that revision committee in Chicago when that rule was passed. All those other fairs are in the habit of charging for one exhibitor's ticket. We have not been doing it in Nebraska, and I tried to keep up the old plan, but all the rest of them are in favor of charging, and that means that each exhibitor applying for space pays $2 for a ticket. That Is, one ticket. The superintendent furnishes him with transportation, for his helpers, just the same as they have done heretofore. It Is only one ticket that Is asked for, and it seems that Iowa and some other states charge for exhibits in every department Mr. Brown: Yes. sir; I exhibited there in Iowa. They always hare charged for everything. Secretary Mellor: It seems to me that Mr. Simpson said they have charged the women and the children's department. — everything. If a person makes an exhibit at the Iowa State Fair he receives an exhibitor's ticket. That is in lieu of the entrance fee. Of course, Nebraska dis - continued the entrance fee a number of years ago in all departments except speed; so that, as long as this is adopted by all the fairs; thirty - eight of the state fairs, interstate fairs, adopted this in their reports. The meeting In Chicago cut out many things that were not adopted, and put In some things that we did not recommend. It was a case of being on our feet during consideration of that report from 10:00 in the evening until a little after 1:00 o'clock the next morning before we finally got through with changes the majority desired; and I think we had better </seg>
            <seg id="p105">adhere to the rules laid down by the Association of State Fairs and Expositions. (President Rudge asks Mr. Hervey to approach the chair.) IvonForell: There is nothing before the house just now. I want : some questions and get sour- information, and that is the position stain to general agricultural education. If there were some ways icb our agricultural co.iege, or industrial college, could be brought &gt;loser touch with this Association and its meetings, it certainly be a good thing. Not only that they might give this Association advice, but that we might also suggest some things that the people ally want and desire on their part. I have been interested in this ular line for a good many years. A Member: A little louder Mr. vonForell: I say, I have been interested in this particular line of agricultural education a good many years, and I find that the Agricul - tural Society is a great educator, and that upon our object school at the State Fair Grounds a great many people are pleased with the instruction and inspiration they receive. The state of Nebraska has also made appropriation whereby the students may be properly equipped in order that they may be helped in this Agricultural Society and at our State Fair to produce better exhibits. The question in my mind is, Can there not be closer relationship existing between the instructional force at the agricultural school and the Society in its meditations and deliberations; and it seems to me that the Dean of those departments, somehow, ought to be in our Association, and help in our deliberations, if only as an ex-offlclo member or honorary member of the Board by consent. It seems to me to be a good thing for the very reason I do not beliere we are getting the very best out of that school we ought to get out of it yet Understand, I believe it is a great institution. It has done wonders. There is scarcely a student who has been there but who says he has been well paid from the start. I haven't found a father yet who has sent his son who is not loud in its praise. In spite of all that, I do not believe it is doing the best it could for the state, and the management of the school are not all together to blame: and it seems to me oar in - fluence ought to go together. There is today a conglomeration of students, a great host of students there with an inadequate teaching force. In spite of all you can say, there is not a systematic individual training that develops studentship in those boys and girls that are going there. I am going to call attention to that matter; and when you see the number of students that have gathered there and how few men in largo classes that deliver lectures. — and, mark you. eighth grade students can not receive proper instruction by formal lectures. It may do for the technical student later on, but it doesn't do for the eighth grade stu - dent who enters upon his ninth grade work there in grade lectures. As a matter of fact, it seems to me that this Society ought to call attention to the fact that there ought to be sufficient instructional force in agriculture so that individual attention and individual training may be given to those </seg>
            <seg id="p106">106 and then I think we would get greater results than we are now. the roaton 1 spoke of this is simply because I have been studying . tions for the past year with the view of sending a son to that insti - tution, and I am not Beading him there, and I am not going to send him until there can be a little more individual attention given to the individual student at the school. I consider it is the greatest institution in the state to promote agricultural interests, and I do not think the peo - i the state of Nebraska can be penurious, nor ought they to in any way hold any other purpose than to make it the very best school of its kind. There ought to be no debate as to whether it is established upon the proper basis, but the only question is. Is there sufficient instructional force there in order that these boys and girls may be taken care of I, for one. want to see the very best gotten out of it if we possibly can. We are on the right road, only we haven't gone far enough. President Rudge: Are there any other remarks? Mr. Russell: I move you that the treasurer be instructed to pay the members $6 each and railroad fare. President Rudge: Anybody second that motion? Mr. Keedle: Mr. President, I move to amend that and make it $9 for the reason that we are away from home three days, going and coming back, and the hotel bills are higher, you know, and we are money out. We come down here to attend the peoples' business while they are at home. We leave our cattle, our hogs, at the mercy, in the winter, to hired help, and I don't think we ought to be right close on these people coming down here and showing their presence and helping. I don't think $9 would be any too much. Therefore I move to amend and make It $9 and railroad fare. I would like to meet with a second. If I can't, it Is President Rudge: Do I hear a second to the amendment? Mr. Johnson: I second the original motion. President Rudge: Seconded by Mr. Johnson. Gentlemen, you have heard the motion.

If not, those in favor of the motion signify by saying "Aye"; contrary, "No." Motion carried. I will call on Mr. Hervey. I think he has something to say about the retirement of one of our oldest members from the Board. Mr. Hervey: Mr. President. I would like just a moment to speak of a matter that came before the Board yesterday in the letter of resignation from Elijah Filley. Elijah Filley is one of the oldest members of the State Board of Agriculture. He is a man who has been very faithful and efficient in all of his duties. He has held responsible positions, and under all conditions and circumstances Mr. Filley was found not only faithful and courteous and kind to his exhibitors, but he looked to the interest of the Association in a way that made him firm and determined in all his actions. Now, this man, Mr. Filley, — it is hard to know Filley without seeing him in his home and on his farm. I had oc&lt; . to viBit Mr. Filley a couple of years ago. and I found a very remarkable condition with Mr. Filley. He is an admirable man in his home, and he is an extraordinary man on his farm with his hired help, with his ani - mals, with everything that pertains to the work or management of a farm. It illustrated to me more fully than anything that had *M curred, the qualifications of that man for the very position that he was occupying here as a member of the State Board of Agriculture. He is a handler of men. If you recall the way that Elijah Filley handled the cattle department, how gentle and kind and considerate he was with all of his exhibitors; at the same time when Elijah Filley told those men what to do, they all did it. There never was any quibbling at all never had any contention. There never was any difficulty at all in Mr Filley's department. He was a remarkable man in handling people. I observed in visiting Mr. Filley that his hired help were all doing their duty. He had a method of starting his men at work at 7:00 o "clock in the morning and quitting promptly at 5:00. The only farmer I know of who had adopted that plan. Now, Mr. Filley's men were prompt, and they were courteous to him. Those men all referred to Mr. Filley a* "Uncle." A close kindred tie seemed to exist between Mr. Filley and all the people about him. The same mild condition of feeling and exhil of feeling was with his stock. We were walking through the stock lot, and there were three or four hogs lying here and there. I observed at once, in place of walking up and kicking those hogs to get them out of the way in order to walk straign. across to a building we were going to. Elijah Filley always walked around: and I never heard a hog squealing the two days I was on his farm. Everything was quiet. I never heard Elijah Filley speak above a very ordinary tone of voice; and the same way with all of his stock, even his cattle. You never came to Elijah Filley's and find cattle bawling. Everything was quiet, orderly, and H~*~matic, from beginning to finish all through. It was a very remark - condition to me, because I had visited hundreds of farmers and stock where I discovered all conditions and dispositions in the men, and </seg>

Kstary Mellor: I will say that all of these men were credited the districts on the board. It seems to me that this correction.

(Seconded) President Rudge: Gentlemen, you have heard the motion. Are there any remarks. Now, let us get this clear, it being that Mr. Riesen belongs to the Fourth district instead of the First and that any votes cast for him on your ballots will appear as being in the Fourth district There are three to elect in the Fourth, and that will make four in thf Fourth.

I presume you ran se that I ever found myself in such the last twenty-four hours. Alter that I was to make an address th Breeders' Association in response I thank you. I am almost over - that I am blushing. I don't think a. predicament as I have been in for coming into the city I was notified l morning at 9:3n AM. to the Stock o Chancellor Avery's address to that association. Well, I studied up Chancellor Avery's history from the snt time. I got his record; I got his fort- me. I got a photograph of him how good looking he was, and got time he was born up to the pre pedigiee, and I have got it all b&lt; and studied that, and found out everything just about right; anc I met Dean Burnett, and he saw: down on the campus this morning "Say, Hendershot, I am to take the place of Chancellor Avery and give the address of welcome." I had already given my speech to the press, you know, and there I was (Laughter.) Well. I ..ave been thinking about this meeting, and I kind of figured up — Now. here is the man that has got the address (referring to newspaper reporter who entered the room at th&gt; time) — thinking about what I could say down here today in ( ase something happened, and I got a little story, you know, and President Riidge wanted me to talk down to the banquet last night, and I says. "No, I don't want to talk at all." But you know, Ollis got up and told my story. I was out again, and I went out and thought a while and came hack in with a new story. McArdle was on the floor and Mack told that story: so I was In a I*; and I went out to the chef knew a story, and he told me antam and the ostrich egg. and I &lt; out there our friend James tol know. That is the funny part norning Uncle Mann sat down bi 'e a story that I want to sprins you. and if it sounds all righ nt you to tell me." He says. told that last night." Now. that down at the club and asked him he did. He told me the story of says, 'That is capital." And while 1 that s'ory, but I didn't know It. So coming out on the car and I says. "Uncle Mann 1 the boys. I am going to tell t I will tell it. and If it doesn't Now. the stor&lt;- Is all right, but the position I stt in. My stories </seg>
            <seg id="p116">have all been told, I have made two addresses this morning, bo I will go back again to this story of the bantam and the ostrich egg. The bantam was watching the ostrich egg, you know; and let us keep our eye on the egg. We all have ideals. I hope they are high. I believe they are. Let us look high. Always look up. Never be satisfied with what the State Board of Agriculture has done, with all due honor to all our predecessors. We must say, they have set the standard very high; but you know that perfection is never reached on this earth, so we must aim high and have faith. That is, keep the eye on the egg. You know that Is the moral of the story. I was intensely interested and pleased with the organization that started last night and was con - summated here today. This will be, in my mind, the greatest stimulus that the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ever has had. If we get the cooperation of all the agricultural societies in the state, and there should be one in every county, we certainly would have a bumper State Board of Agriculture at the State Fair. That is the idea. We are catching the idea as we go along. I am glad to know that it is the State Board of Agriculture and not the Farmers' State Board of Agriculture. I must go back to the early history of my own county. Pardon me for taking that, but I am very well acquainted with it. At one time Thayer county had the credit of having the best county fair in the state, and I believe she did. We put up a thousand dollars in prizes for the trotting horses. This organization was organized by selling stock in it We raised enough money to buy eighty acres of land. They happened to want the land I owned. I did not want to sell it, but I said in order to encourage the fair I would let it go. I did so. When the meeting first met and organized, the farmers. I would My, had the majority of the stock; but when they came in there this had been worked up by the merchants, and it was called the Thayer County Agricultural and Mechanical Society. It was officered almost entirely by the merchants, and the first fair was a cracker jack. The farmers all came and they brought in their pumpkins and their pigs and their cows and calves and the rest of the farm products, and it was a cracking fair; and we had a cracking race meet there. The race men were paid in the evening before the sun went down. The farmers were paid in the Sweet Bye and Bye. Well, the first year; we had so much stuff there that year we couldn't take care of it — the farmers did. The agricultural hall was too small, and the art hall was too small. It is always small. They extended the buildings. That was wise. We built it well; but when they got ready for the pumpkin show there were no pumpkins there. No pumpkins there; no pigs there; just a few pigs; just a few horses; just a few cattle, but the racing was superb. Ah, it was a crackerjack. It was going some, too. The next year Mr Farmers says, "We will change this thing. We will show these boys how to run a fair"; and they did. They came in. They elected a president, a farmer; they elected a secretary, a farmer; they elected </seg>
            <seg id="p117">the board of managers, farmers; and the farmers went to work. They plowed up the in-fleld and rented it for $10 an acre to a gardener in our town named Mr. Boyes. He raised a cracking good crop of potatoes there. We had a fast race, a slow race, and another race — a human race, I guess. They had a cracking good pumpkin show, and everything was filled brim full. They had the double decked business all filled up. Er had the pumpkins piled clear around the house, and they had Btock pens filled up, and they had a cracking pumpkin show, but didn't have much of a horse fair. The amphitheater was empty. I don't think they sold $10 worth of tickets for the amphitheater. The Eyear we came back there to the fair, and they had the race track ted to watermelons. Mr. Boyes had got hold of that. I think he told me he sold $800 worth of watermelons off of that race track. (Laughter.) That is not a joke. That Is what he sold. The next year we didn't have any race track. We didn't have any pumpkin show; we didn't have any fair, and we haven't had since. That ground was paid for when we commenced, by selling stock — every dollar of It. They paid me $6,500 for it, and they paid cash. Before this thing closed they borrowed money of the First National Bank of Hebron to the amount of $2,600. That money was expended on finishing the improvements they had already started, and paying for them. After that all the land went into the hands of a receiver, and was sold at receiver's sale. No n ore fair down there. It is all potato patch now. I am pleased to in that on the State Board of Agriculture we have represented almost every class in Nebraska — the stockman, the farmer the doctor, the merchant, the preacher, the banker, the lawyer; and we have got a splendid set of gentlmen. And I might say for the benefit of my friend McArdle, that we have a few politicians. Well. we need them. Indeed we do. We need the politicians. We need ♦■very one of you. and you have all got a place; and I believe you are able tot fill it. Now, just cooperate with the incoming Board of the State Board of Agriculture as you go out all over this western country — preach the doctrine of better cattle, better horses, better hogs, better farm products, and bring them all to the State Pair. We will be building new buildings and piling pumpkins up on the outside of this old Agricultural hall. We will have Old Daddy James jumping up and down and calling for help and saying. "Where will we put it; where will we put it?" It Is in your power. Will you do It? I believe ytm will. I believe you will There is a duty that devolves upon me as your President that some- ■I almost shrink from. It is no trivial thing. It Is a serious thing. Mack would tell a story right now.

Secretary Mellor: Gentlemen, before you elect the Secretary I would like to make a little statement. The Premium List and the Year Book of Agriculture will probably be out — so far as our office work la concerned — the last day of April; and it may be possible that I would like to take a vacation. If so, I am not to be paid during my vacation, but I would like to take a vacation, If you elect me, during the months of May and June, and if you would desire to elect somebody else for Secretary who would give the months of May and June along with the other months, why. this is the time for you to take proper action. I state this because it is possible that we shall make arrangements to take a trip during the months of May and June. I do not say It is absolutely certain we will do this. It is not settled yet, but I want to be fair with this Board, to give you knowledge at this time before you elect me. if you intend to elect me as Secretary. Mr. Keedle: I move that the rules be suspended and the President be instructed to cast a full vote for Mr. Mellor as Secretary for the ensuing year.

Of course, that is another consideration, although you have been very kind in doing this, and I appreciate it very much. When a man feels that his work is appreciated, it is the highest compliment that any one can pay to him, and I really feel that the State Board of Agriculture have complimented me this morning in this vote, taken as it has been, and you know that I am grateful. I thank you. gentlemen, (Applause.) Eident: Gentlemen, what is your further pleasure. The appoint )f the Board of Managers, I think, is the next order of business, will ask Mr. Hendershot then to name the incoming Board of ers. Er. Hendershot: Mr. President, Members of the Convention: I inate, for your approval, the following members for the Board of agers for the incoming year: Charles H. Rudge, LJncoln, chairman; V. Hervey, Omaha; Peter Youngers, Jr., Geneva; Colonel L. W. lard, Pawnee City; E. Z. Russell, Blair. ■ McArdle: Mr. President, I move you that we ratify the selection President. President Rudge: I did not hear the motion. Mr. McArdle. Mr. Ardle: I thought it was necessary to ratify it, and made a motion to that effect. I supposed it was. President Rudge: Do I hear a second? (Seconded.) Gentlemen, It has been moved and seconded that the nominations made by our President be approved by this meeting. Setary Mellor: Now, are we doing the thing that is right. I under that there was a law in our books that the First Vice-President member of the Board of Managers, is that right or not? ■ Wolcott: That is right. Mr. Rudge introduced that three yean Made that motion. President Rudge: I don't think there Is any law to that effect. Mr. Hendershot: Gentlemen of the Convention: I do not want to take one lota from Mr. Haws. He Is my friend. He Is one of the best workers on the State Board of Agriculture. He Is a gentleman in every place, but this State Board of Agriculture owes to the older men some duties. Mr. Haws is a young man and can come again. Colonel Leonard has worked, to my knowledge, for the State Board of Agriculture for many years, and if he is ever rewarded, it has got to be soon. I had hoped that things would have been different, and this could have been averted. Precedents are dangerous, mighty dangerous things, and it is a bad thing to get into. I am opposed from the beginning to the finish to this precedent of electing a Vice-President, and forcing him upon the President of this Society as a member of his cabinet. There is no other organization in the land that does It; and gentlemen, if this Board succeeds, it must not be by precedents. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">They are dangerous. They are treacherous, and they will not stand the test That is all I have to say. SMcArdle: Mr. Chairman, I was under the impression that Mr. was on the Board of Managers when I made that motion to it. I certainly would not have made such a motion only under take. Mr. Hendershot: If there is a rule for it, I will change my Board of Managers. If there Is no rule for it, I shall stand pat. Mr. Keedle: If my memory serves me right, back when Mr. Filley was Vice-President, some three or four years ago, if you will get the minutes of that meeting, that we adopted, and so amended our rules, that the First Viee-President should be on the Board of Managers. He should be recognized and have a certain place, and in the absence of the President should be chairman of the Board. I think you will find that on the minutes; and of course we adopted that. If it is not practicable, why, of course, it is all right. As I understand, at that time that was the question. Kdent Rudge: Will say, gentlemen, that Mr. Mellor has gone report of that meeting. You will have it here in just a few ) so that we will proceed. Mr. McArdle:What is that? President Rudge: Mr. Mellor has gone for the report of the meeting which Is referred to; and my recollection, though, of the meeting la that up to that time we had keen kind of at sea and hunting for a Vice-President, and in placing in nomination Mr. Filley at the lime, I said I did not believe this was a position that ought to go begging, and we ought to have a man for Vice-President that was on the Board of Managers, so he would be In touch with the Fair, in case of the necessity of him serving in place of the President I do not think there was any amendment made to any by-laws or anything, but I think it was just from a little remark made in placing Mr. Filley in nomination, in his favor, and I think Mr. Filley was placed on the Board of Managers. I do not think he was for the reason I had made those remarks, but I think he was put on there because the President wanted htm on there. However, we will have the minutes here in just a few minutes. Mr. Youngers: Mr. President, I guess we can discuss this matter? President Rudge: Yes, sir. Mr. Youngers: It looks to me like, in the absence of the President, you should have the Vice-President on the Board to take the chair. President Rudge: The chairman of the Board of Managers takes that position In the absence of the President — of the Board of Managers. The chairman of the Board O. K.'s all the vouchers and claims unless they authorize the President to. Mr. Roberts: Mr. Chairman, I wounl like to ask a question. President Rudge: Mr. Roberts. Mr. Roberts: As to whether or not our organization does give the </seg>
            <seg id="p122">President the full power to appoint the Board of Managers. Does it or does it not? President Rudge: I am up against it. I can not answer the question Mr. Roberts. Mr. Mellor will read the proceedings of that meeting. Secretary Mellor: At the 1906 meeting, during the counting of the ballot, Mr. Rudge said this: "During the counting of the ballot I would like to say a few words in regard to the Vice-Presidency as an empty honor. It has been considered by a great many of the men who have been elected to the office of First Vice President as being out of the way and out of lines for everything elM. I think we are inclined to look at it that way. Since this Association last met two of our most valuable members have been called away, and in the natural order of things this Is liable to occur — who knows what may come round, when our President may be disabled, or perhaps — we all have to die and pus away — and I think we should have as First Vice-President a man who Is in touch with the running of the State Fair. There is no good reason why the man who is elected to the office of First Vice-President could not serve on the Board of Managers, and I would suggest that the First Vke-President be made a member of the Board of Managers, but I think it it necessary to go back and incorporate It in the rules. There is no good reason why the Vice-President can not serve as a member of the Board of Managers as well as superintendent of any class. One thing I notice that ever since I have been a member of this Board that the Vice-President has never had anything to do with the fair, even as superintendent of any department. I think we should select a man who is in full touch with the running of the State Fair." Secretary Mellor: The remarks of Mr. Rudge were there deferred for the election of a President President Rudge: That is while they were counting the ballots? Secretary Mellor: That was what he said while they were counting the ballots. » Roberta: Turn here in the Constitution on page 23: "11. The int. Secretary, and live managers selected by the President shall Board of Managers." Are we working under that rule, or are we President Rudge: There is no other rule covering that IMcArdle: I believe I made that motion myself at that time; that n is already covered by a previous rule. There is a previous rule that the Board of Managers shall be appointed, I think, by the dent and ratified by the Association. As far as I know, that is set rule, but just a custom you had here. President Rudge: At a suggestion that was made here at that time, but not voted upon. It was just talked about in those rambling remarks I made while the ballot was being counted. There was no action taken on it whatever. A Member: On page 22 the duties of the Vice President are plainly pointed out, as follows: "7. It shall be the duty of the Vice-Presidents, </seg>

If at any meeting of the Board it shall appear that neither the President nor either of the Vice-Presidents are present, then the meeting may choose a President pro tern." President Rudge: Gentlemen, the motion before the house is to ■ the nominations, — adopt the report of the President on the Board of Managers. (Seconded.) All those in favor of motion signify by saying "Aye"; contrary, "No." Motion carried. What is your pleasure, gentle - men? Is there any unfinished business? If there is no further unfinished business, I will ask Mr. Hendershot to take the chair. (Applause.) The following resolution was adopted: Ireas, a bill has been introduced in the United States Congress by entative McLaughlin of Michigan for the purpose of appropriating annually to the Agricultural College of each state and territory United States, to be used for purposes of agricultural extension, mere' Institute Schools, in the operation of demonstration farms, r other work similar to the work now carried on by Farmers' te movement of this state; be it Eved, That the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture at its annual held this nineteenth day of January. 1910. heartily approve House ). 15422. and that we ask our Senators and Representatives in is to vote and work for the passage of said bill.

IMcKelvie: The time was. and it is within my memory, too. when r papers were not looked upon in the same light that they are and I think it was largely because they were edified and published :n who knew little about the business. The fellow who could not made a pretty good farm editor, and there you found him. But that has changed. Some ten or a dozen years ago, maybe fifteen years </seg>
            <seg id="p124">ago. men came into the profession who knew what farming meant. They were really the horny-handed sons of toil. They had held the plow handles and knew just what they were talking about; and we see today in the agricultural newspaper field, those papers the most successful which have been published and edited by men who were actual farmers and knew whereof they spoke and whereof they speak today. I am glad to say to you that we have with us this evening one of the oldest pub - lishers of an agricultural paper who was really a farmer, and whose paper is read by farmers, and is just strictly a farm paper. A few yean ago we had elected to our presidential chair a man who had been out upon the soil somewhat himself and had gathered something of the Information about the farmers. That president, Mr. Roosevelt, realised that with all the fertility of the soil and the productiveness of the soil there was something wrong. The boys and girls were flocking to the city; so he appointed what he called, or what he was pleased to call, the Country Life Commission, and at this time this farm paper editor of whom I speak was called to be one of that commission. En glad to introduce to you tonight, ladles and gentlemen. Honorable r Wallace, the Des Moines editor and publisher of "Wallace's er." and late of the Roosevelt Country Life Commission, who will o you about the work on the Rural Life Commission. (Applause.) Honorable Henry Wallace: Mr. Chairman, Fellow Farmers of Ne - braska: When I received a request from Mr. Keyser asking me to talk about the work of the Rural Country Life Commission I had already begun the preparation of a lecture entitled "Some Rural Problems," — three or four subjects which I wish to get clearly before the minds of the farmers of the West. It has grown out of my observation on the Country Life Commission, and therefore not to disappoint you I will pre - face it by a brief statement of the work of that commission; and I do It the more readily because the conclusions which I have reached and are expressed in the paper grew out of that work. In August, 1908. I was very much surprised by an appointment on some commission. I did not know what. The first notice I had of It was a telegram from the New York "Herald" wanting to know what I thought of my appointment As I had not heard of any appointment I could not answer it But In a few days I got a letter from the President, asking me to serve, without pay, in connection with four other gentlemen, on what is now called the Country Life Commission. He asked us. first, to ascertain the conditions of life in the open country. Now, that means not merely farmers, but all people who have to do with farmer*: for example, country doctors, country preachers, rural route mail carriers, etc That was the first thing. — to tell him what were the conditions of life In the open country. Second. To suggest remedies for such evils as we found. And, third, to suggest a way by which this work could be carried on after he left office. We met in September. The members were, the Dean of Agriculture of the Ithaca College, New York (Professor </seg>
            <seg id="p125">I); President Butterfleld of the Agricultural College at Amherst; • Page of the World's Work; Giltord Pinehot, forester, and myself s was subsequently added Mr. Barrett, the president of the Fanners' , an organization that had at that time 1.780,000 farm members in good standing; and Mr. Beard of Sacramento, California. We .nd organized in September and sent out 500,000 circulars asking an questions, and twenty-four subsidiary questions, covering sub - which we wished to investigate; for example: "Is the sanitation ir neighborhood satisfactory? If not, why not? What suggestions you to make? Is the rural school education satisfactory?" And i. "Are the arrangements of the banking facilities satisfactory? Are the buying and selling facilities satisfactory?" And so on right hrough twelve questions, with which we endeavored to cover the promi - nent features of country life; and closed this with the question. "What n your judgment is the most important thing to be done to correct the evils of country life?" Now, to those we received 125,000 answers — a most remarkable return. The Census Bureau thought we would not get over five per cent We got 25 per cent. In addition I sent out myself 28,000 circulars covering the points of landlord and tenant; the tenure of the land, and farm labor; and I received about 6.000 or 7,000 answers n full. These were turned over to the Census Offlce to be tabulated. They were not through coming yet when we closed our report. Then we visited twenty-five Btates and held meetings, to which the people most likely to give most satisfactory answers and those that were most deeply interested in country life were invited. We did not aim to have more than one hundred. Sometimes we had as high as 500, — seldom less than 100. Now, mind you, we were not out to preach. We were not out to give opinions. We were not out to tell anybody anything; but to find out what the people thought on the points covered in the circulars. We had with us a couple of secretaries who took shorthand notes of — not the answers, but of the condensed answers. We had an official stenographer. We had. in addition. Dr. Stiles as the medical attache. We had with us one of the men connected with the Irrigation Reclamation problems and also an official of the Agricultural Department. We visited twenty-five states, among them Nebraska. We had a meeting in Omaha, which was the least satisfactory meeting we had, for the reason that half of the time the people didn't know where we were to meet, and we scarcely knew ourselves; and we had no room sufficiently large to accommodate the people who wanted to come, anyhow. We then went to Washington, and we had a meeting with the National Grange Com - missioners; with the Association of Experiment Stations; and with one or two of the general women's associations. Then finally we made up our report. The long report has never been published. It contained 30.0*0 words. There was a short report of perhaps 5,000 words that was pub - lished as a Senate Document, but has not seen the light since. A great many people wonder at it. I will tell you why. The lines were down between the two ends of the Avenue. Our friend Teddy was at war with </seg>
            <seg id="p126">the House and with the majority of the Senate. Unfortunately he ap - pointed two other commissions. One was the Conservation Commission, of which Mr. Pinchot was the head; and another was the Homes Com - mission. I don't know who they were or how ihey were paid. Their object was to investigate the conditions of city life, and they laid on the table a document which the Senate, in an unguarded hour, published as a document, and then concluded the next morning that in view of the maps of the cities covering the districts 'ommonly known as the "Red Light Districts," and the reports of the prevalence of certain diseases unmentionable in polite society, together with maps of some of the cities of the United States, they concluded it wasn't fit to go through the mails. Half of the senators didn't know but (hat was the Country Life Commission. (Laughter.) And besides they didn't want to pub - lish the conservation report, for reasoi.s which are more obvious now than they were then, and so, in a spasm of virtue. Mr. Tawney of Min nesota arose in the House and offend a resolution that the Hmm do not publish the reports of any commissions which it did not appoint — which was a whack at our friend Teddy. — aimed at him. and which, unfortu - nately hit all of us. The most valuable work of the commission are those 125,000 answers to the questions sent out. In addition to that there is a vast volume of essays, of contributions, of discussions, which Sir Horace Plunkett says is the most vaJuable mass of material on country life that has ever been gathered since the world began. The President asked $25,000 to be put in the hands of the Secretary of Agri - culture to enable him to tabulate it and edit it, and put it in shape for publication or for the investigation of students in social and country life. That is what the appropriation was for. The Senate granted it, but the House refused to concur. I am glad to tell you that the short report, which only hits the high points of the subject, has since been published by the Commercial Club cf Spokane; and if any of you will write to the "Spokesmen's Review ' of Spokane you will get all the report of the Country IJfe Commission which lias ever been Riven to the public. The large report exists only in manuscript, of which I have one, I think, of the fifth revision: and do you know, gentlemen, they have been coming to me in Des Moines asking for the loan of it to be copied with the typewriter. You may ask what we got out of it. The Commission all gave their whole work gratuitously The circulars were printed by the Department of Agriculture; the work of tabulation was done by the census offl.ee; the attaches, with the exception of the stenographer, belonged to one or the other of the departments of the government. The total money expense was $.",800, of which a lady, whose name I am not permitted to mention, gave us 13 000 advance and the other $800 was paid by the commissioners themselves. We gave suggestions as to remedies, but we did not say anything as to how this work would be carried on. I will tell you why. We realized, under the present con - dition of the public mind, that any work of this kind that would be done effectively must be done without money and without price, unselfishly. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">The President told us at the start, — and he asked us to give our time freely, — that he found that the best work ever done was done without being paid for. That is the kind of work Mr. Pinchot has been doing.— spending all his income, and sometimes more, in carrying on this life work of conservation. We didn't care to ask that we should be con - tinued. We would have been willing to give some time and some money, but we did not care to accumulate data of value and put it before the people of the United States at our own expense; and until the Government will work up the material that we have, and put it before the people, we do not expect to continue the work. President Taft says we are still in existence, but my observation is that if in existence at all. we are in cold storage. (laughter and applause.) Now. gentlemen ubject tonight is "Some Rural Problems;" and. as I said to you. the discussion is largely the result of my work on the life commission. There are several things the farmers of the United States need to seriously think about: and that is my nbjo. r in rrf^nting I Some Rural Problems. I proceed to Ike discussion of borne Rural under Uv pr &gt; conviction that the perpetuity of a truly Democratic form of government depends more than anything else, or than all other things combined, on the prosperity, the health, the intelligence and the patriotism of the American farmers. The open country supplies on the one hand the food, and furnishes the bulk of the purchasing power that makes a prosperous city possible. The open country is the preferred breeding place of strong men and pure women. The plainer load, tk*. enforced economy and industry, the more natural and wholesome family life, and the 'om - parative freedom from the temptations to vice and immorality, put the bone and the sinew in the country-born that enables ih- .11 t:&gt; gain the great prizes of life in competition with the city-bred. The over-populating power of country stock, in connection with the great improvemeir machinery and methods, which render less labor necessary by rendering It more efficient, enables the country to pour a constant stream of freeh blood into the city. On the other hand, the city uses up country bred men as It does country bred horses. Not only individual men and women, but families. Even in a great city like London, it is said to be hard to flnd a man of any note or power of efficiency whose grandfather was I^ondon born. The farm boy makes a start. His children acquire wealth: the grandchildren spend it in luxury, dissipation, and vices that sap the foundations of character, and the family soon dies out altogether or ceases to be a force or power for good. The farm boy when he goes to town either succumbs to the temptations of the city, if he is badly bred, or "makes good" If he is well bred. His grandchildren curl up by the lire, and It takes more than the paternal kick to force them to make good as their grandfathers did. Hence, the big business of the cities is con - ducted by the country-bred for the first or second generations, while </seg>
            <seg id="p128">the great masses of the city-bred, incapable of self-government, render the cities the plague spots of our American civilization. Rome passed from a republic to an empire shortly after her farmers had moved to the towns and cities, and their great city, the mistress of the world, became dependent on Egypt for bread. In the cities wealth untold becomes concentrated, and its enormous influence is wielded by the few. In the country, taken in the aggregate, is much greater wealth, but it is divided among the many. In the cities corporations have the control. Control of the politics and politicians of the nation is easy. In the country it is difficult; in fact, impossible, except when the country is Imbued with a great moral purpose and righteous cause. Concentrated capital, controlled by the few. has ever stood firmly against reform, except when the reform would result to the immediate benefit of capital. It has always stood, and always will, for the kind of government, good or bad, that puts money at once into its coffers, whether that be the wages of sin or of righteousness. The money classes of the world have not reformed since the day when Jesus Christ drove traders out of the temple. There - fore, the permanence of the institutions we received as a sacred trust from our fathers, government of the people by the people and for the peo - ple, depends on the prosperity, the uprightness and the Intelligence of Jie country people. No people can be strong, healthy, or intelligent unless they are enjoying a reasonable degree of financial prosperity. There is no virtue in poverty, although we have known people who made a virtue out of it. There is no sin in property or prosperity if honestly earned and wisely used. If farmers are to wield their proper influence, or even to hold their own, they must be prosperous. If they are to be premanently prosperous, it is only by conserving and maintaining the fertility of the soil. This, therefore, is the first of these problems. Maintenance of Soil Fertility, I am convinced that few farmers, or even professional students of agri - cultural conditions, realize the extent to whteh we have already wasted by far the greatest of all our national resources, the available fertility of the soil. To even begin to realize this we must go back at least one hundred years. At the beginning of the Nineteenth century the country west of the Alleghanies was either unbroken forests or unbroken prairie, on which Nature, or to speak more correctly, the great force which is always behind Nature, had been storing up fertility for ages by the slow processes by which what we call "Nature works." The forests east, north, and south have, for the most part, disappeared, and a large pro - portion of the forest products have been absolutely wasted. Acres of black walnut, each one now worth a king's ransom, have been used for fence posts and firewood. Great white pine forests, the growth of two and a half centuries, have served mainly to lay the foundations of colossal fortunes that, in ways often devious, are now able to control the lumber and other resources of the intermountain states on the Pacific Coast. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">The soil thus denuded of the timber has been mined rather than farmed, until a large section of this once heavily timbered conn : y refuses now to grow red clover on account of its acidity, and cries out for com- mercial fertilizers Let not the farmers of the prairies brine a railing accusation against Kpthren of the timber sections, for they, too, have been miners and bers. rather than farmers. Possessed of the strange infatuation ese deep, rich, black soils of the western prairies were inex- ■ble in their fertility, they have continued to demand of them which are invariably soil robbers, and adopted rotations only when ■■lied to do so. Even then they have largely failed to adopt such ins as will at once retain the vegetable matter and nitrogen. They been saved from bankruptcy so far in our day by the increment of land prices, due to the great increase in population, both natural and by immigration. Today the question of how to restore worn-out land romps to us from Nebraska as well as Illinois: from Dakota as well as Ohio, and the states farther east. If we turn to the South, conditions ar far more pitiable. As a member of the Country Life Commission I traveled through Maryland. Virginia, North and South Carolina Tennes- Kentucky, Mississippi. Louisiana, and Texas; and, while the study of the soil fertility was only incidentally in the line of our investigations. I was deeply impressed with the waste of available fertility evident on v hand. It is estimated that fi.onn.onn acres of land that once grew profitable crops of cotton are now growing up in timber, in many of whtcb the old furrows are yet visible. In addition to this there are other millions of acres more recently abandoned, on some of which even weeds will not grow. There are others on which erosion is don? Its work, '.at these acres Mem to turn their tear-furrowed faces In prayer to heaven. On still others one may see sedge grass growing in cotton rows with small pine trees, lending its aid in the beginning of the slow processes of Nature in restoring to the land the fertility which its owners have recklessly wasted. In the southern states, east of the Mississippi, erosion is doing Its deadly work. The smaller rivers of the South which once ran clear as al are now colored with the yellow soil of the uplands, while the at the mountains, denuded of their timber, for the growth of which !!)•■&gt; were alone fit, is rapidly filling up the river beds, furnishing an Kto southern statesmen for a division of the spoils in the "pork " The black waxy lands of Texas, like the black corn lands of , can endure this hard treatment longer, but, owned as they are for the most part by landlords and cultivated by one-mule farmers, who know only cotton farming. — can give only cotton as security for the rent, or with the season's crop mortgaged, in advance. — it is only a question KB when these lands will refuse to grow a crop which will command B markets of the world more than the actual labor required to Ke it. The tenants with families will then be driven to the factories, r are the states east of the Mississippi where such factories are now </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 K established. The landlords will then be obliged to either divide lands or rent to men competent to .leal with them, or else learn farm them themselves. I'alifornia we found large cattle ranches which were once great fields. The one-crop system did its fell work there, as it Is In part of the agricultural world. Where water is available, these heat fields have been converted into vineyards or fruit farms; and it is not, the only recourse Is the pasture, where, surely if slowly, will carry on the work of binding up the broken-hearted land. I have all heard of the abandoned farms of New England. Some of ■re now being allowed to grow up in timber, for which, after all. *ere best adapted. Others are converted into pastures. On many se lands machinery can not be used to advantage, and the change ■ise one. Some are homes for the wealthy of the cities, and In the many more will be converted into orchards. Given the same care aying, pruning, and packing the fruit, there is no reason why New nd can not grow better apples than are grown in the most favored s of the intermountain states. Ksame process is going on in the great corn states of the Middle There the results are not so apparent, simply because of the jus fertility of the soil. The patrimony is larger, and therefore s longer to waste it. The verdict must be that the Nineteenth ■ farmer was not a farmer at all, but a miner of the soil fertility, en as a miner, a notorious waster. And yet throughout all the last century there were good farrriers; quite as good farmers, under the circumstances, as there are today, and on whose practices modern science has set the stamp of her unqualified approval. There were farmers who used clover wisely, quite ignorant of the great discoveries of modern science; who fed wisely, while they ignorant of its chemical analysis. There were farmers who used lime In the main wisely, although they had never heard of soil acidity; had never heard of the word "flocculate," but knew that lime improved the physical condition of heavy clay soils. What few agricultural papers were able to exist without much advertising, were better edited than the average agricultural paper of today, for the good and sufficient reason that they were controlled from the editorial room and not from the business office. Looking back over it all, however, we can see that it was quite in - evitable that good farming should be the exception and not the rule. It is human nature to spend lavishly that which costs nothing. Th. wealth of the forests and prairie came to us as a nation, composed mainly of farmers, as a free gift from the hand of Nature; a gift which we were not sufficiently intelligent to use wisely. The virgin soils pro - duced so lavishly that we did not need to farm well. The extension of railroads from the seaboard to the grain fields enabled us to find a market for this available fertility in the Old World, and we sold it. Under the delusion that our soils were Inexhaustible we set fire to our straw stacks, </seg>
            <seg id="p131">and preferred to move the cheap, prairie stables rather than haul out the manure. (Laughter.) Many people think that is a joke. It is a fact. I once bought a farm they said \va3 pretty badly worn out, and I went to work hauling out manure. Finally I came to a post that had it off; and I said to the man, "What does this mean?" "Well. he says, "I used to work for this man, and here is the stable." "And he says, "it got so full of manure we found it was cheaper to cut those poets off and set them over there than it was to haul out the manure." ( laughter.) The railroads, the growing factories, the cities with their 1 1 diversions and greater opportunities, and the desire for shorter hours of work and a more luxurious life, lured the brightest farmers' sons to the city. Improved machinery multiplied vastly the efflcacy of the farmer's work and therefore his power as a soil robber. The man with a gang plow and binder could waste more soil fertility in a year than his grandfather in a score, or perhaps in a lifetime The homestead law. a subsidy to agriculture, scattered population over ntire west, greatly Increased the actual crop acreage in proportion to the population, and made grain so cheap that the only profit lay In vp farming. Thf fartuei ■ speak of his "home.' but talke of his "farm." which he was always ready to sell. If he let it, it was for but one year to a tenant who regarded his lease as a license to get out of it all he could and put nothing back. Then prices of products advanced and speculation of Und s&lt; t in. To garner the unearned incrfr ment. rather than grain, became the chief aim of the average farmer in Nebraska and adjoining states. Under the circumstances, human nature g what it is, soil exhaustion was inevitable. With an annual addition f millions of virgin acres, our average yield per acre has not increased until within the last few years. England, which once grew no more wheat per acre than we, now grows twice as much on a soil and in a climate no more favorable. Lands in the more progressive sections of the Old World that have been farmed for a thousand ye«irs shame us t the only thing we can boast of is that we grow more wheat per acre than the peasant of Russia or of India Fortunately, there must be an end to all this. There remains now no land watered by the rains of Heaven to be possessed. Fortunate with the exception of soil erosion, disclosing available fertility that has been wasted, the Great Creator in His wisdom allows man to rtility to a certain extent, then locks up that fertility and lows the land to produce only so much. — just about enough to pay for the labor, but nothing for rent or profits. He thus compels the bonanza larnier to divide up and sell bis land. He compels the landlord to either maintain the fertility of his farm or in time to sell it at a lower price. England brought up her yield of wheat from 12 bushels to over 30 per acre. an do the same when we learn to farm instead of mine, or to really farm instead, as we are now, of speculating in land </seg>
            <seg id="p132">The Problem of Farm Labor. The next problem to consider, closely connected with this, is that of health on the farm as part of the labor problem. If our wasted heritage of the soil fertility is to be restored, or the present supply is to be maintained and increased, more labor must be employed. Farming must gradually become more and more intensive. The labor must, for the most part, be farm bred, for the reason that, with the introduction of improved machinery and stock breeding, feeding and dairying, the skill required can not be obtained in a day or a month or a year. The foreign - hat are pouring in upon us from year to year by the hundreds of thousands are of no use on the average farm. They may be used in the sugar beet fields, in the vegetable gardens, and in the large fruit-growing &gt;ns, but are not at the first worth more than their board, if that either on the grain farm or on the stork farm, or even in the cotton field. Our crop production is now limited to a very great extent by our small supply of reliable farm labor. I am amused at the wise men of the East lamenting the lack of intelligence of the farmer, asking why they don't get these people from the south of Europe. Why, every man who has ever tried it knows that they are not worth their board : that farm labor is skilled labor, and a much higher skilled labor than in the ordinary factory or in the office. Our crop production is now limited to a very great extent by our small supply of reliable farm labor. The man ac - med to city life will not go back to the land; the town bred boy Is valuable, provided he has inherited farm tastes and is taken when he is young. The farm laborer of the future must be farm born and farm trained. Hence, the health of the farm from which the future supply of farm labor must come is a question very closely associated with the 'ion of soil fertility. The waste of child life and the inefficiency of adult life, due to lack of sanitation, ventilation, and sunlight in farm homes is far more serious than the farmer or students of farm life are aware. I was appalled while on the Country Life Commission at the waste of child life and the inefficiency of farm labor in the South, due to the prevalence of what is now known as the hook worm, something I had never heard of before, and especially in the sandy district on the Atlantic Littoral or sea-coast plain. The southern one-mule farmer is not lazy as we think he is. He is sick. His sickness is due to a para - disease, which is said to carry ofl about one-fifth of his children before they are five years old, and which robs him of from 20 to 50 per cent of the red corpuscles in his blood; and, hence, of his efficiency. Not more than half of these farmers have privies at all; and not one in ten of them is sanitary. The farmer and his children go barefoot much of the year and thus fall a prey to the hook worm, a parasitic i similar to the strongylus contortus. or round worm of sheep. It gets between the toes, burrows under the skin and gets into the capil - laries, and then into the circulation, and in about 62 days becomes a fully developed worm, capable of reproduction. Closed privies, shoes, and </seg>
            <seg id="p133">R about seventy-flve cents worth of thymol and epsom salts work a cure In about a month. And as a result of our investigations John D. Rockefeller (whether as an insurance against something in the future or not, I do not know), has wisely put $1,000,000 into the hands of a committee, the present guide and leader of which is an attache of the Country Life Com - mission, Dr. Stiles. Not only in the South, but over the entire country tuberculosis takes its fearful toll of human life, — a disease which we now understand is not heriditafy, but can be prevented by proper housing, sanitation, care, and food. The pioneer, in his temporary home, is comparatively free from it. Tuberculosis comes 1b with the new house, often heated almost to suffocation, without proper ventilation and sunlight. All over the country typhoid fever, which also takes its fearful toll of human life, is now almost universally regarded as a country disease, due to impure water in defiance of the well-known laws of sanitation. The country slaughter house, usually located at the head of a slough, and each one by itself, receives the tuberculous cattle which the farmer is not willing to risk sending to the markets to have inspected. The offal is fed to hos?s. whirli necessarily become tuberculous. These slaughter houses are infected with rats, which travel back and forth to the farms and sometimes carry trichinosis. This is another menace to the health of the farms. If we are to grow skilled farm labor, which alone is worthy of employment, we must stop this enormous waste of life and efficiency on the farms, due to preventable diseases of many other kinds, which levy their fearful toll from the farm. Farm folks should be the healthiest, the most vigor - ous people in the land, and will be when we ventilate our houses, as well as our up&gt;to-date cow barn, when we learn to feed our families with rations as wisely balanced as the skilled breeder feeds to his horses, his cattle, or even to his pigs. (Applause.) Many a farmer takes infinite pains to provide sanitary conditions, ventilation, and balance-1 rations for his live stock, but makes no special effort to provide any of them for himself and his wife and children who are to perpetuate his name and spend wisely or foolishly the results of his toil and care. In short, if the lack of farm labor is to a very great extent the limiting factor in our agriculture, as indeed it is, if our soil fertility can be maintained only by intensive culture, which always demands more labor, if this labor to be efficient must be farm born and farm trained, then the problem of health on the farm is one of the most serious that confronts the American farmer today. We can not as farmers, east, west, north, or south endure this con - tinuous drain on our resources, — this loss of the efficiency of young men and young women, caused by the plainest violations of the laws of health. We must produce our own labor and increase its efficiency. In the corn and grass states it must become more highly skilled as farm machinery becomes more complex, and this can not be done without sani - tation and the lighting and ventilation of our homes that will insure vigorous health and a higher degree of efficiency in the farm born and farm bred. </seg>

It is idle health and efficiency of the farm icnt in the fertility of the soil or a wider and more comprehensive health; know where to observe nd the plant and he animal before the earth will yield us our lull fruitage and feed and clothe the hungry nations. Our scant crops and many of our bodily ills are due to our own ignorance of and our disobedience to the laws o? nature. Therefore the problem of rural education is at once the most mportant and difficult of the many problems which await solution at the hands of the people of the open country. We are just beginning to realize he importance and to make earnest, if as yet comparatively ineffective, efforts towards its solution. The Country Life Commission visited wenty-five states, and heard delegations from some ten more. In all but one of these states, great emphasis was laid by the witnesses on the defects of the rural schools. In the remaining state, in Nevada, we ieard no complaints because there are no rural schools in that state. (Laughter.) In fact, having hean and it was our mission to hear te an opinion) we could very easily of the rest. The complaints wen ony in three or four state timony and not in any way to express and accurately forecast the testimony made that the teachem were, for the most part, young and inexperienced; were not in sympathy with rural life 'ven when bred on the farm: were for the most part gaining experience o qualify them for more lucrative positions in the town schools, or awaiting an attractive proposal of marriage, town fellow always preferred laughter); that the attendance was mall, lomposed mainly of the younger children; that the teacher, even if earnest and efficient, was landicapped by the lack of proper grading; that the schoolhouses were neither well heated, well ventilated, or well lighted, and altogether un - attractive; that the subjects taught were not taught in terms of farm ife; that both the teaching and the teat her pointed townward, rather than farmward, and the farmers fled to the towns to educate their chil - dren. The laws of some of the southern states, it is true, require the eaching of agriculture, but we could hear of no actual teaching. It was bluntly stated in Tennessee that the better the school was the worse it was, because all the more effctively it pointed to the town. In Massa - chusetts it was stated that there is no rural school, but only a poor town school located in the country. Swas not within the scope of our instructions from the President to lire into the teaching or the schools in the cities or towns, but it 16 Hess to say their teaching pointed to the college, the store, and the »ry, rather than to the farm. We didn't find any too much agriculture ome of the agricultural colleges in the South. Most of them empha - i the mechanical arts and the sciences relating thereto, rather than culture. In justice to the rural school it must be said that it is now in a state </seg>
            <seg id="p135">of transition, and has not had time to adapt itself to the changes that taken place in agriculture itself. Fifty years ago, or even twenty - fiv.\ the schools were larger in point of numbers and pupils ranging in age from five to twenty years. In the former period they were taught almost altogether by men. I never went to a female school teacher in a rural school in all my life. The rural population, and especially the school population, was greater than it is at present. The farm the Kast had not as yet been driven to the town by the declining ft-: of his land, nor in the West by the increase in rental values, which led him at least to hope that he could live with much less labor and greater comfort in the town, thus sterilizing the schools by the removal of hi? children. Boys from thirteen to twenty had respect for a male teacher, and would rather take chances of a drubbing than to be taught by a girl, for whom at that age they had little regard, however they might, and certainly would, change their minds afterwards. The educational facil - ities of the town were not nearly as great then as now, nor were there so many alluring fads in the system of high school education. Sometimes we older men long for the old rural school crowded with pupils large and mall, with a male teacher, with a bundle of well-selected and wel!- ■med birch rods just back of his desk, and the chance of "barrin' out" at Christinas if he didn't furnish us the customary treat of s, cider, and candy. It is a vain longing; for those days will never return. Prosperous farmers have retired to town, and taken their children with them. It is not popular for the larger boys and girls to attend the rural school taught by a girl who must, perforce, waste much of her time, teaching often as many classes as pupils. From my heart I pity her. I - meantime the average farmer retains his affection for the rural school, asserting that a school that was good enough for him is good enough for his children. By nature the farmer is conservative, and changes his opinions, methods, and institutions only when forced by necessity to do so. He therefore pours out his money, and is pouring it out today in Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois, without stint and without inquiring as to value received, and prefers to retain the old schoolhouse and offlcers to a chance of better schools for his hard cash by making some changes, and especially is he opposed to it if he happens to be a school treasurer. At least, that is so in Iowa. The present condition of rural affairs can not last always. Transition periods come to an end. Sooner or latter, the problem must be solved if the farmer is not to become a mere peasant; but no one solution will apply to all sections of our diversified country. In scattered localities It it already solved by the centralized school in the township, properly graded, with domestic economy, manual training, and an elementary agricultural course In the higher grades, with an assembly room for lectures, and with an acreage adjoining for sports and a garden. Wherever climatic and other conditions render it practical, that is the ideal solution. In other sections it is partially solved by the temporary grouping of two or more schools with less than six, or even ten, pupils each. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 The final solution must be shaped to a Kivat extent by changes in rural population. It is by no means certain that in the corn states the quarter - section or in the wheat states, the hall' hi lion, will continue to be the recognized economic holding; that is, the holding that will give the fanner and his family a good living- A qui • of land farmed as It should be, and in time will be, will support two families quite as well as it now supports on?. The return of normal seasons in the semi - arid section, will sooner or later check the westward and northward migration of young people from the corn belt. The high prices which farm products will assuredly bring as the result of the lower purchasing power of the dollar, together with the competition of foreign labor in the cities, must in time at least check the present drift from the farm fo the It will dawn upon our retired farmers, or farmers about to retire, that they can build on their own farm a house with all modern con - veniences quite as cheap as they can buy a lot and build one in town; and thus keep in touch with country life. This means a check in the decline of rural population in proportion to urban. Intensive and a more widely diversified farming will provide profitable occupation on the farm for a large portion of the natural increase which has been drawn by ambition to the town, or by land hunger to the new sections of this country and Canada. It is even possible that the retired farmer may come to see that he can be even more comfortable la a home with modern con - veniences on his own farm than in a house with or without them in the town or city. Certain it is that the more intensive cultivation will be forced upon us, will increase the rural school population, possibly double it in ten years. It will then be possible, by intelligent rural school distri - bution and grading, to employ one male among two or three teachers ami thus command the attention of the larger boys, who prefer the chance of a thrashing to being taught by a girl. Until agriculture passes out of its present state of transition, the rural school problem can not be finally The education of the country child begins in the rural school; its agri - cultural education begins elsewhere. The most that the rural school, as at present organized, can do. is to teach in the spirit of the farm in - of the spirit of the town. It must not be forgotten that the boy receives valuable agricultural education on the farm, and the only way by which any education can be permanently valuable is mainly by the do'ng of the thing taught. Why, you don't know a word in your Bible that you can understand except by the doing of it. The better the farming, the better the education; the more intensive the farming, the more valuable the farm education which the boy gets at home. Methods will be learned on the farm. For knowledge of fundamental principles he must look to the agricultural press, the agricultural college, agricultural writers, agricultural books, the bulletins of the Department of Agriculture and agricultural college, and to the farmers' institute. Through these, and particularly through the work of the extension de - partment of the various states, he has had a taste of the new agriculture. </seg>

Taxes will be levied to the limit on his property, because he can not hide it. Other industries, both laborers and capitalists, are organized quite thoroughly, and the organization will lie perfected from time to The farming class alone is unorganized and unsyndicated; and before the syndicate the unsyndicated man must ever go down. The individualism which has been the strength of the farmer in time past will be his weak - ness when it becomes necessary for him to organize and cooperate. I failure of former cooperative enterprizes among farmers, where lave failed, was undoubtedly due to the fact that they could not together, in view of the temptation to the individual of immediate whether in buying or selling. They can not hang together, because o not trust each other, and they do not trust each other because o not know each other. I socialization of country life, the development on the farm of a life and a rural civilization, if we care to call it such, quite dis - and separate from the social life of the cities, is, therefore, one coming problems. — difficult, serious, and of the utmost importance. This socialization will not become general until forced by necessity, by pressure from other organized forces; but it Is not too early to talk about it now. It is time to cultivate a farm spirit, quite distinct from the urban; a social life quite distinct from that of the town. This social lfe must have a center in each locality around which it revolves. It may be the local grange. There is at present nothing better, if the life of the Individual is deemed worth more than the dollar, or, in other words, If the social and educational sides are made prominent.

            <seg id="p268">PART OF ADDRESSES AND PAPERS. AT THE FIRST ANNUAL MEETING CONSERVATION AND STATE DEVELOPMENT CONGRESS. Dean Bessey: When I graduated from college, of course I was just about as green as a cabbage leaf, and as I look back I wonder that they hired me, but I did know one thing. I was brought up in Iowa, In the middle of the state. I got a little patch of ground there to make a garden of. My idea — I came from Michigan to the Iowa prairies — my idea was that it was good to put manure on the ground. The old farm superintend - ent who was in charge of the college farm then — they do not have that kind now at Ames — laughed at me. He was an old Scotchman, and he thought that I was just twelve kinds of a fool to actually pay to take the manure out of the barnyard to spread on my garden, and he laughed. That was a great joke, that ha was able to at tually sell that manure. I hauled that manure from the barnyard and covered the ground with it to a depth of about three inches, because I had the idea then that the soil, to be kept, i 'd. 1 have had that notion since. But just a word along there. We must not stop with these material things. We must work for the conservation of our people, so that to be a Nebraskan a century from now will mean more than it means now. I wish I had in my pocket a letter from a Filippino who got his education over here on the campus, in which he tells us of what it means to him, — he is In the Philippine Iatudi now. — to have had four years here on the campus, — what it means to him to have had something of the Nebraska uplift; and he is promt that he is a Xebraskan, that he has had the opportunity of calling himself a Xebraskan for four years. So let us con - serve our people, — you are a pretty good looking lot of men now, — so that a century from now your sons, and your sons' sons, and your sons' tons' sods as they gather here in a conservation meeting shall be still a finer looking body of men. Let us conserve our people, — our men or women, our children. — the hope of the future. (Applause.) Dr. Condra: Let me give you a little bit of history. A few years ago when they were organizing the state conservation commissions, — there are something like forty now, — and when Governor Sheldon ap - pointed a commission for this state, he appointed a commission that was to be a non-political commission. He looked about and found the men who were working and trying to build up the resources of the state. Then when our present governor came into office we did not know just what he would do; but the president of the commission went to him and said, "Now, it is up to you. If you want to fire this whole bunch, do so, but they were chosen for this particular kind of work." And the presi - dent of the commission felt pretty good when the Governor said, "Well, the bunch looks pretty good to me." Our present Governor is Interested </seg>
            <seg id="p269">F A A I in conservation, and he ?a« fit to take these men who were appointed non politically, and continue them in that work, and he did. I feel very kindly toward the Governor tor that, and you do. The Governor of our itate is interested in conservation. He will now deliver the principal Governor Shallenberger: Ladies and Gentlemen — I thought I was go- »be a little tardy here this morning. I found that I had not been as ided as my friend the Mayor had been, — had not reduced anything might say to you to the written page; and the reporters were all about my office this morning wanting me to help them out with something that they mignt say in say to this gathering, so I stopped ing the experience that I have har the papers on what I should have to to dictate a little to them, remember - a good many times on occasions such as this when I have not prepared anything, as I should have done. You l know, somebody has said there are three s|iee&lt; hes one always makes on occasions such as this: First, the one we write and prepare very care- fully and give a great deal of consideration to; second, the one we actu- ally make after we have forgotten what we have written down; and, third. the one the newspaper fellows fix up in the morning. 1 see my friend is very busy over there now. You know, my friend Condra has been a little Bmentary to me here this morning, and I listened with a great deal rest to his idea of conservation in this state of ours. He has got t thought. He has got a subject there that is on his mind a good I was with him up here at Lyons last summer. I went up there to a speech at a school graduation exercise. We were riding along. and we noticed that the Logan river was far out of its banks and washing down over the country destroying the corn and one thing and another: Ih-ofessor Condra looked out and right in front of us in the car Is, looked around and said, "Yon offensive." (Laughter.) said. "Oh. Lord! What a waste." A who weighed about three hundred ne: man. those personal remarks are I appreciate very much the honor the opportunity of welcoming you hf In our state. This is the first one. a! has been held in Nebraska, and it is in any state in the Union. I added I "State Development" because, as I c and the privilege of being accorded re to the first conservation congress Professor Condra has told you, that the second one that has been called •&gt; the call for conservation the words insider those matters that are mate- Eus here in Nebraska, the problem of developing the natural re - that Nature has so kindly bestowed upon us, that is perhaps a of equal importance at least with the preservation and conserra - the natural resources that are now ours, perhaps more or leaa un- You know, Nebraska is somewhat peculiar among the states in the Union in that we are dependent upon agriculture for our material re - sources; more so, perhaps, than any other state in the Union. We have not great mines of wealth stored here beneath our soil of gold, lead, line, or copper, or any of the useful or precious metals. We have not great speech of the morning. Governor Shallenberger. </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 forests from which we can get lumber from which to build our buildings. We have manufactories principally upon our eastern border here, and therefore our principal and constant product of material wealth mu - that that we take from this fertile soil of ours. And I think perhaps we are fortunate in that the wealth of Nebraska, the material wealth of our nation, — of our state rather, — lies in these two great things, that Is. in the matchless richness of our soil and In the wonderful climate that we are blessed with. Some Canny Scotchman once told me that the wealth of the world was in the weather, and if that is true of the world at large it certainly is especially true of Nebraska. And because of the fact that our material wealth is stored in the soil, and that the climate and the rainfall are so essential to the realization of that wealth, I think we are especially fortunate in that it is impossible that monopolistic corporations or combinations of men in any way can ever control or absorb the natural wealth that is stored in the soil or limit to us the benefits that this gen - erous climate has bestowed upon us. We are fortunate in the respect that the conservation of the great fundamental wealth of Nebraska, that is. the worldly wealth, that is stored in the soil is dependent upon the in - dividual efforts of our citizens. It lies primarily with the farmer and the stock-grower himself. And therefore I am glad to have so representative a gathering of men from all of the different counties of the state to come here and to discuss and consider this, in that we may carry back, if. we will, to the thousands and hundreds of thousands of representative far - mers in the state, this wondenul lesson of the fact that the very prosper - ity, and promise of prosperity, of Nebraska is dependent upon the indi - vidual effort and intelligence in the conduct of the soil that is enti . to him, as Dean Bessey has said, almost as a matter in trust to be held for the generations that shall come. There are now many things that we can consider earnestly in the de velopment of our state. I have had the pleasure of speaking a number of times in the last year as a representative of Nebraska, sometimes where the representatives of other states have been gathered, and I have Mi to all of the methods that the other states can boast of In the way the wealth, conservation of natural resources and development have been brought about by the efforts of the citizens of those states. I was up in Seattle last summer at a gathering there of representatives of a number of the states of the Union. The governor of every state was invited there on that occasion. They had the great irrigation congress there, and one governor after another boasted of the world of wealth that Nature has provided and stored in his particular state. The Governor of Florida was there from that far-off Southland telling us of the delightful climate in that sunny land, of their great water frontage, of their tropical fruits, of all the wonders that that Southland could boast of; and there was the governor of the young state of Montana, I remember. You know, Mon - tana is the most wonderful state in the production of copper of any in the Union. I remember that he boasted that there at Butte they had a copper mine, a veritable mountain of copper, that produced six millions of copper </seg>

That great Btion was fostered and built by our republic in order to exhibit to us sources of Alaska, because it was considered so valuable to our re - ; and the commissioner of Alaska told us of the marvels of the wealth of that country. The thing t thing that means most to us. of cuu ,(1 of most of all, and the ■v. was the production of gold there. I remember of his stating, in telling 1 the marvels of Alaska, that in fif- teen years they had produced $1 of gold from the gold fields of Alaska, and they had sent it down through those great cities there that surround the Puget Sound country, the portals of the nation, — added $15",- portals of the nation, — added $150.- 000.000 of gold to the actual money U it carries on the commerce of this Well, finally when I Nebraska I admitted all the world- ly wealth that all of th had produced because of those a Kl things that Nature has sti imented the Commissioner of are 35,000 of them he told u 1 of gold, because we all kn in their borders, and I especially ■r Alaska upon the fact that his people, — . — had produced in fifteen years $150. - w that that is a lot of money. — $150,- 000.000. I told them we had no m Idaho; no great forests like they lies of gold and silver like they had in have in Washington and Oregon; we had no coal mines like they have in Alaska; we had no copper mines such as the governor of Montana boasted of; no mines of wealth except that which God had stored beneath the surface of our fertile plains; and yet such is the wonderful richness of our mines that, not in fifteen years, but in every one, the farmers of Nebraska had produced $150,000,000 of actual wealth out of our cornfields; and our "gold" mines are not exhausted when they take that worldly wealth from them from the fertile mines and our fields. If we conserve them as we should, and if the generations to come will enter into the great project of the conservation of the soil of Ne - braska as they should, our fields will be just as rich in a thousand years from now, yes, richer than they are today. And there is no other kind of wealth, my friends, that has that wonderful faculty. Now, there are a great many things that we can stand for here ii. braska, I admit, but I speak of development and conservation. Here is </seg>
            <seg id="p272">this matter of the forests, for instance, that our friend Dean Bessey re - ferred to. We have no forests, as I have said, in Nebraska, no great for - ests, from which we could gather lumber. Because we value a tree so much for its beauty in Nebraska, we will not cut it down for its utility; but, my friends, we have the prospect and possibility of forests in Ne - braska that shall be commercial and shall be useful. The prairie fires have swept for hundreds of years over our prairies and destroyed the nat - ural efforts of the forests to spread their growth over our fertile plain. I live down here, my friends, although you know, some among you, that I am a Democrat of the deepest dye, I live on Republican river. (Applause and laughter.) And that river winds its way for 230 miles through the southern border of our state. There are four hundred tributaries of liv - ing water that flow into the Republican river through that 250 miles of fertile Nebraska prairie. Up and down those streams Nature has scat - tered oak, walnut, elm, hackberry, and ash. and all of the varieties of wild fruits, — and many more, cottonwood. and other useful timber. Not in quantities as a rule that we can cut commercially, but indicating as plain - ly as Nature can the place where man can grow trees easily, naturally, and profitably. My friends, those lands upon which grow those trees are rough, they are broken, they are of little value today, but in every pocket, in every draw, in every little rock that is around those streams, up and down, are hundreds of thousands of acres that today are of almost no value, but if man will intelligently plant those same varieties of trees that Nature has scattered over there as a lesson to us that we can grow, we can make those lands that grow those trees the most valuable of land to the farmer. The same is true of the sandhill region. You and I know that that is the largest region of one particular geological formation we have In the state, and already the United States is carrying on wonderful experiments to show us that those sandhill regions, properly protected, can grow pine trees profitably, practically, and to the general advantage of the state, just as easily as they grow out in the sandhill regions of other states, in like circumstances, and better protected than ours has been. We talk about the possibility but not of profitably growing lumber. But here within thiR week a man from Saline county came into my office, and showed me three pictures. One was of a forest he had grown upon his farm in Saline county; another a picture of a sawmill in which he was cutting up lumber he had grown there; and the third, a picture of a splen - did house he had built with lumber he had grown upon his own farm in a generation. That is a living example of what we can do in our country when we have the foresight. As Dean Bessey said, we are no longer liv - ing for the hour. We are not simply waiting to get back to our folks and make a little money. We are trying to build a country that will be eter - nal. We should build for all trhie. The question of the forests should :ve our attention, because forestation after all is a subject of agri - culture, a branch of agriculture. They had a little quarrel down here I believe in Washington as to whether Pinchot belongs to the Agricultural Department, or whether the Agricultural Department belongs to Pinchot; </seg>
            <seg id="p273">273 but in any event they don't affect the component parts of growing plant life upon the farm; and this same man who grew the trees that built his house here in Saline county showed me a picture of a little forest he had grown there of walnut trees now big enough some of them to cut a board aa wide as would make a seat upon that chair (indicating chair In front of speaker.) The lumber in that little forest would sell today for as much as the entire farm was worth. He said that while hi.s neighbor's farm has come to be worth about flt.MX the natural advancement in the pri foresight thirty years ago to plant farm now has a farm that today is much to his land by planting a few has added by all his labor and toil we must consider. or $15,000 in the last thirty years by ■e of the land, this man who had the a few acres of walnut trees upon his worth $30,000; and he has added aa walnut trees as the farmer adjoining upon his farm. These are the things There are other things that we can stand for in the way of conservation and development in our state. Here is this question of water. You know we are always thinking of water in Nebraska, and especially in the summer time. I live down here in Harlan county on the south side where the Sappa and the Beaver come together there and flow into the Republican River; and in 1894 we did not have much of a crop down there, and we didn't have much of a crop anywhere in the state. You know that in 1896 we had a great battle all over this state, and the country, you remember, to determine what our standard of value should be. We were quarreling whether it should be yellow or white or paper. We didn't have any money. That was the trouble with us; and when we were quarreling about that I was riding on the train down to Oxford to get home, and I met a banker friend of mine from New Orleans. I was at that time in the banking business at Alma. We were on opposite sides of the question, and we quarreled about this matter of the free and un - limited coinage of silver all the way to Oxford, and by the time we got down there I was so hoarse I could hardly speak, and he could not be heard above the noise of the train. When we both got up a farmer friend of mine who had been listening to the conversation drew me to one side, and he said "Shallenberger, I will just tell you this, the trouble is not whether we have a free and unlimited coinage of silver, or the free and unlimited coinage of gold. What we need is a free and un - limited supply of water. Give us plenty of water, and I *ion't care what money you make. We will have all kinds of it." In 1898 I had a friend who came up from Missouri to earn a little money in Nebraska and go back to his wife's folks. He came, and he went hack without the money. Just as he was going to leave I met him and said "Crum. where are you going?" He said, "Well, I will never stop until I find a place where it rains, and then I will just laugh myself to death." I have no doubt that when you men leave here if you find it is raining that every one of you will laugh until you split your sides. That only touches the value and importance of conservation of the water upon our soil. We have sufficient rainfall in Nebraska to raise </seg>
            <seg id="p274">splendid crops if we conserve that water rightly. The aim and object of our education up here that our agricultural students are receiving at the agricultural school is to teach them the value of intelligent fanning, not only to retain the richness that is stored in the soil, but properly also to conserve the moisture that falls upon the soil. Why, you think sometimes, my friends, that we are getting to be rich here and our farm lands are productive and we are good farmers. My friends, in certain things you ought to be ashamed of the farming you now do when we con - sider what men do In less favorable circumstances than confront us here, and when we accomplish what we do with all tue natural conditions that surround us here. Why, my friends, I was to make a speech some years ago In Nebraska at a gathering of business men in the western portion ol' the state. As you know, here about the central portion is the wheat section of the state, and our aggregate yield out here was the largest of any portion of the state. And that particular year I remember the average yield of wheat per at re in Nebraska was larger than that in any other state in the Union, and I felt that as a nation our great Union was able to produce the greatest aggregate of wheat of any nation in the world, and that in Nebraska was the greatest place to produce the staff of life of any place on earth. When I began to look up the statistics I found that 1 was wrong. The average yield per acre in the Inked States is 13 bushels. In the British Isles, where they have raised wheat for a thousand years, the average yield per acre is 40 bushels. They raise three times the amount of wheat. And we in many of our states have been going back in the last few years. Nebraska is about the only state in the Union that shows an increase in the average yield in its oats and corn; something like 30 bushels to the acre. My friends, we ought to get 40 bushels of wheat to the acre, and we will when we get the right kind of farmers here who will appreciate the right kind of agriculture on the Nebraska farm. \a-i me give you, if I do not talk too long, a concrete illustration of what I mean. We haven't scratched upon the possibilities of our agriculture, because we have got an intelligent set of citizens. We have the highest average in intelligence and character per individual that you can find in any state anywhere on earth. I may be making a mistake in comparing the average yield of wheat per acre with the rest of the world, but I do not make any mistake in comparing the average citizen, the boy and girl, in Nebraska today with any other state on earth. I am sure of that. Now, let us look back and see what men have done in other regions less favored than ours. I have an uncle that lives in Derbyshire. England part of the time, and part of the time he lives in Ames, Iowa, where the great agricultural school is located, really the most famous one In the United States. I went over to tell them what I knew about farming a short time ago, and I met him there, and he had some farms around Ames, Iowa. He said, "You know, you think these are good farms here, but you don't know how to produce wealth upon a farm here." And he showed me a picture of a bunch of cattle, an English farmer, his wife. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">and six fine sons and daughters; and he said, "Let me tell you the story of that man." He said, 'Thirty-five years ago he was working upon a British farm and not receiving more than two shillings a day," which Is fifty cents In our money,— "except in harvest time when he received three shillings, and his wife got far less wages than he was receiving. And they got married. The father of this man, knowing he was an In dustrious, careful fellow took notice of him and he went to the Duke of Devonshire, who was a great land owner there, and he said to him. I have a young couple that will make you good tenants.' They were looking for good tenants there just the same as they look for them in Nebraska when the land is valuable, and the Duke of Devonshire said Wht-n I find a piece of land that he can handle I will let him have It In about two or three years he came to him, and he said, 'I have a piece of land for your young man. 1 And the old man went to the young man and said. 'I have got a good farm for you.' The young man said, 'I can't take that farm and stock it. I haven't got the money. It is impossible for me to raise that money.' The old man said. I will lend you the money and he did lend the money himself. After thirty-five years a son came back from Iowa and visited this man upon the farm, and he saw the man and his wife and six as fine children as he ever had seen. They had an old, beautiful British homestead, covered with ivy such as they grow in that country,— a beautiful typical English home,— with all thoge children about it. They showed him the books upon that farm for six years back. And during that .six years that man had lived upon that farm in Derbyshire and kept his family as well as any farmer's is kept in the best parts of the United Stan&gt;s. Hi&gt; had kept two of the older boys and girls all the time in a school where he paid $600 a year for B tuition. He reared them and educated them well. They were , intelligent children. During the six years, in addition to this. lad made $25Ou actual money profit upon the farm, loaned out at st." And this man told me that that man had made more money upon that farm where he paid $14 an acre, kept up all the taxes, making an aggregate cost of $18 an acre per year cash rent, and where he iu only allowed to plow 37 of the 178 acres he had,— 150 acres had to be kept in grass all the time, — than the average farmer in Nebraska and Iowa does upon the farm that he owns in fee simple, as we do in Ne- braska. So, I say, my friends, the profit of the Nebraska farm is scarcely Ied here. That man had a market for his milk, and he ran a dairy in which those boys and girls had worked and added to the wealth that farm; and that same thing can be worked out here in Nebraska, must be, because our land is getting more and more valuable all the is the years roll around, because we are in the very center of that portion of the republic that must produce the surplus for the people of the world. You know, my friends, when we encourage the increasing by intensive farming the production of more corn, wheat, and all the staples of the Nebraska farm, we are adding not only material benefit to the people </seg>
            <seg id="p276">of Nebraska but to the people of the world. You know we produce a larger surplus now of the agricultural products than the people of any other nation of the world. Our prosperity is based upon a rock because of these things. We people in Nebraska produce the essentials of civiliza - tion. Panics will come and the mine and the factory will close down; the demand for the products of the mine will cease. The man will lie Idle, commerce will become dormant, but there never will be a time and there never has been a time In the past, and we know It will not be In the future, when you can not put the corn, the beef, the wool, the mut - ton, and all those things that are absolutely necessary for modern civilized life, upon a train here and run them down to places like Omaha, Kansas City. St. Joseph, or Chicago and sell them for cash upon the open market. That is the reason, my friends, we did not feel any panic in in Nebraska. That is the reason we can face the future In confidence, because 1 say we produce those things that people must have, the result of which is and always will be a market for our products. My friends, I am talking here longer than I intended when I began. There Is another subject I want you to consider here, and that is the subject of transportation, and the roads of our state. Now, I was down in Washington last January during the conference of the governors. The fact that impressed me more forcibly than anything else, a wonder - ful interest in which is being taken all over the country. Is the matter of good roads. You know the automobile has made traffic upon our roads a great deal more important not only to the farmer but to the citizen who lives in the town and enjoys and owns an automobile. The question of keeping up these roads has become of a great deal more importance and interest, because these things are like engines, not run upon iteel rails as they run on railroads, but run on the open roads. The stone roads that we build have all sorts of traffic, and people everywhere are wrestling with this subject of building good roads and maintaining the good roads we have got now. I spoke to the governor of the great little state of Vermont where they have those great quarries, the stone that is so essential to the building of good roads; and he told me he thought sometimes that we were more fortunate than they, because they have those torrential rains, and they have a character of soil that no matter how carefully they build the roads they are being washed and torn and destroyed by those great, torrential rains, whereas here in Nebraska we have the ideal condition for road building. My friends, we have through our state here these great rivers. These have always been the natural highways for the travel of men. Up and down those great rivers, these great valleys of the Platte and Republican and Blkhom the pioneers that moved across this continent more than fifty years ago to conquer the empire of the west marched In a great army of American civilization. Now, up and down these same rivers are the steel highways, back and forth across whose rails rush every day a thousand trains, like shuttles in a weaver's loom, carrying the commerce of a continent. We have got the natural conditions for good roads. We </seg>
            <seg id="p277">277 have a level prairie country. We have a character of soil that is eirtart raised into a hard, firm road-bed. We have a condition that only needs the intelligent effort of our people; we need our laws to be remodeled; we need intelligent engineers to direct this problem of the proper construction and building of our roads. I realize that that la going to become more and more an important question. I feel it more now as. I say, because I have been in those older states where already they have felt it and are working out that problem. For instance, the little state of New Jersey; down there the governor told me they had appropriated $35,000 for the purpose of building roads for the year, this in addition to something more than a million of money that the counties and state have expended upon their roads. New Jersey is not as rich a state as Nebraska, if you stop to consider for a moment, my friends, our financial condition here in Nebraska. We haven't a floating debt of a dollar. We haven't a bond Indebtedness, and we own millions of bonds of eastern states. They thought we were poverty stricken, but they sold them to us because they have not got money with which to buy them at home. That is the condition of our state. I am glad we can face these things with confidence. All we need is to have men turn their intelligent efforts toward the accomplishment of these things. That is what w« have a conference such as this gathered here today for, to nave men come and gather here, each one stimulate the mind of the other, talk together, and devote some time to these great broad problems that are essential to the material welfare of the state I hope this shall not be the last one. I hope here will be develope 1 an enthusiasm, a spirit, that will lead to more and greater conferences in the future to deal with these statewide problems that can only be met as this one has. My friends, we have a right to expect that not only is the state going to put forth greater efforts in this matter of development and conservation and the preservation of our natural resources, and the development of those great things that Nature has started for us in Nebraska, but we have also a right to expect that the nation itself is going to carry on this great conservation movement they have started. The first impetus of the conservation movement, as you know, was started at the national seat of government. This soon spread out to every other state. My friends we have been doing a great many things in other lands than this re - public of ours, seeking to carry American ideals and the benefits of American civilization and American brains and intelligence to help uplift those other people. We have spent a great many hundreds of millions of money over there in the Pacific Islands in the Philippines seeking to carry American ideals and American benefits to that little brown people over there, of a different race, another color, that do not speak our language, and that would not rise to defend our flag in its hour of peril. We are spending no man can tell how many millions in Panama, a thousand miles from our nearest sea coast. In order to build a water highway through to carry the commerce of the world. Of course, we all admit these are opportunities, these are occasions worthy of our </seg>

We can build here, my friends, a better race of men than any they can find across the seas, if they sail them east or sail them west (Appla With the opportunity here for the advancement of civilization, we can establish and maintain a higher standard of civilization than we can find in other lands if we travel north or travel south, because it will be easier to build American homes, upon American soil tor American citizens. My friends, if you want markets, why. we can find them here, because American men when they make the money are not afraid to spend it. We can build here an ideal citizenship, as I have said, who will fight our battles for us in time of war and buy our goods of us in time of peace; men of the hills and of the plains; of the valleys and of the farms, men of Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, and all these states that surround us here; men who can ride far and shoot straight, men who will be the foundation of our nation's credit and of her prosperity in time of peace, and the bulwark of her honor and of her glory in time of war. (friends, let us conserve, as Dean Bessey has said, our people, and Ivor to develop that greater kind of citizenship and to preserve those ;s that are essential to the preservation of this civilization, which men are gathered here to do. And I congratulate you. gentlemen, welcome you as warmly as I may. and wish you every success in ! efforts that you have before you. I thank you. (Applause.) Mr. P. W. Chase, of Pawnee County: Gentlemen — It surely affords me a great deal of pleasure to come before this meeting at this time to talk on the matter of good roads, for no one is any more of a crank upon that line than I am. And it does seem to me that as I address these good roads conventions that every time I am introduced I hardly know where to commence; and at this lime I am worse off than I ever was before, it seems. I recall that on one occasion I was introduced as Mr. Chase, the owner of a model farm in Pawnee county. Well, now, that was a stumper to me at least, because I knew I had no such thing, and I got around it in this way: Down in the corner of our state they have a Ijuiies' Aid Society, and they meet once a week or two weeks, and they discuss various things that pertain to this society. One afternoon the subject for their discussion was "a model husband," and so they discussed this pro and con in its different phases, to see whether any one of them had or possessed a model husband or not. And it was evident that Sister Jones, although she was not present, possessed a model husband.

Wfll now, the good sister did not know what "model" meant, and she made a courtesy and thanked them very kindly for the honor, and had to let them go on, of course. As soon as they had gone, she went to the dictionary to find out what "model" meant, and she found out that model meant "a small imitation of the Well, now, I have been dragging the road for the last five years along past that small imitation of the real thing down in Pawnee county, and that is what I am here to talk about this afternoon. Here is a photograph taken from a photograph of that road. Now, then, as this meeting is one which I consider of as much importance as any ever called in this state, or at least any that I have been acquainted with, I am not going to take up any preliminary time telling stories or anything of that kind, but am going to get right at the business. That is what we are here for. Time is money; business is money, and the first thing that comes to my mind in reference to the good road talk is this question: "Why do we want a good road?" Now, that may seem simple to you, yet it means a whole lot. "Why do we want a good road?" First, I would say It i» to conserve time, — saving time. Time is money; time is what we want, — what we are after. We are all trying to save at least as much time as possible, particularly in these days when labor is so scarce and so inde - pendent So it is necessary that we conserve time, save time. A good road from our farm to town saves one-half the time; at least one-half. It saves time, and all kinds of businesses are trying to save time. Our United States government is paying out millions and millions of dollars to save time in the construction of this wonderful Panama Canal. Railroads have spent millions of dollars in trying to save time, and so equip their road that the same car can handle as much again tonnage as it could years and years ago. The farmers are trying in every way possible to save as much. Why, when I moved onto the place that I now live on, let me tell you what the arrangement of the buildings was like. There was the barn away off on the prairie. It seemed awfully far away to me. And the first morning that I got up on that place. — we moved on there the last day of February. — and started out to milk the cows it seemed so far away, away off there to the stable on the prairie, that I turned around and went into the house, went up to my wife, and kissed her good-bye. She wanted to know what that was for. 1 told her that I was going out to milk and the cows were so far away that I didnt know when I would get back. We have arranged those things now so that barn and the stable are closer to the house. We save more than half of the time by the rearrangement of those buildings. We are all trying to save time, and by that means it saves us at least half. It is a source of pleasure to have good roads. We all know that. We all know that where the good roads are, there Is where they take the pleasure </seg>
            <seg id="p280">rides. It is a pleasure to us, a pleasure to the people who visit us, and a pleasure for the people who travel through the communities in which they are located. And not only that ; it adds a value, a good road past the farm, I don't care whether it is a small imitation of the real thing or one of the costly ones, it adds so much to the value of that place that we can hardly express it in dollars. The next question that comes to my thought .s, "What kind of a road?" Now I was called to address a farmers' institute in this county not long ago upon the subject of good roads. The president said to me. as I stood upon the sidewalk in that town. "What kind of a road do you recommend? If you are here to recommend a macadam road we don't want to hear anything of what you have to say. If you are here to recommend a dirt road, why, all right. " But as I stood upon the sidewalk and looked into the street of that town and saw the water running down where the travel should be and the travel went where the ditches were, I thought most any old thing would do in that town, be it macadam or what not. And that town is not more than a thousand miles from where we are Now, then, so far as the macadam road is concerned I do not think that we are ready for that. That costs lots of money, and I care not what kind of a permanent road we have, it takes lots of care and atten - tion to keep these roads up. I know that the macadam road is one of the most costly roads to keep in repair of any we have. Then there is the gravel road. That costs a great deal of money, so we naturally fall back to the dirt road. Now, the time may come when we in the state of Ne - braska may possess thousands and thousands of miles of what is called permanent roads. And here perhaps it will not come amiss if I quote a little bit of history. Go with me, if you please, into the New England states where they were covered at one time with dense forests. And I can remember when my grandfather telling me when he was a little "so - year-old," when he was a boy. the only mode of transportation which they had, the only mode of conveyance which they had in those early days was either on foot or horseback, and they went by marked trees through the forest until a trail was well established, and he went on and related this little anecdote, and I can not refrain from relating It here, although it is years ago that he told it to me, and he has passed into the Great Beyond long years ago. He told this, that when he waa a boy that his father's people had to have a hired girl, and that they found one, but across through the valley over across on the other side of the hill, at the home of Captain Samuel Parkhurst. Her name was Saphronia. Now, Captain Samuel Parkhurst was one of George Washington's body - guard and then was promoted to captain, and he was my great grand - father. Now, he went over, saddled up the old mare, and went over to Captain Parkhurst to get Saphronia to come and help his father's folks out. So he forded the river and followed the trail by those marked trees through the bottom, and finally drove up to the horse block in front of Mr. Captain Parkhurst's. Saphronia came out, got on the horse right be- </seg>
            <seg id="p281">hind him, and put her arms around him. He said that was the beginning of a goiden wedding that was celebrated over fifty years thereafter. The next mode of transportation in those forests was the ox cart Then they had to deviate a little from the trails which had been made with the one horse and find smooth places through the timber in which they could go with the oxen and cart. Then the next thing was the ane-horse shay; and it was a thing of as much note in that remote rical time as the auto is today. And then was the beginning of the ■ when good roads were needed. Since then, since the one-hore« cam into existence, and these roads were called for they were made. We read that in New England were made corporations, companies were formed, and money raised, enough money to build roads over the hills and through the valleys, and they were called gate roads, that is, toll gate roads. You entered them through a gate, first paying the toll gate keeper, who would open the gate, and you would travel on. And and our country commenced to settle and prosper, light up by the state and otherwise were made free year tt public roads; and so it has gone on from that time until this. And as that continued and other communities demanded, or necessity demanded it, requirements have been met in the free roads needed to carry on the business in that locality. Go back to those old ox-cart trails and ■ will find now in many instances beautiful, good roads; some of them gravel, some of them macadamized, and this where at one time was the ox-cart trail, now are these beautiful roads. An enormous amount of money is spent yearly upon these roads because the people demand it. and the business of that community demands it. So I say that as Nebraska settles up and becomes prosperous, and as told us at this convention how it was going to be one of the leading and is one of the leading states of the United States, as our people want it tue permanent road will be built, but until then we will have to get along with what we have got. And so I am here this afternoon to advocate as I said, the good dirt road Now, then, you all understand, I think, what the elements are that go to make up our soil. I can not tell you what they are, but they are of that substance that if you take and wet it and smear it over with a trowel and lay it in the sun it becomes hardened and crusted. I am going to indicate this afternoon the use of the road drag. For five years, I think it is, I have been using the road drag along beside my place in Pawnee county. After I had used it for two years the de - partment of farm mechanics at the State Farm asked me If I could not get a photograph of the road down there in Pawnee county where I had been using the road drag and where it had not been used, right next to it. I told him I thought I could. And so when I was in town I saw the artist, and I asked if he could come out and take a photograph of the road down there next to my place and the one this side of there, coming into town; and I asked him if he could come next Monday morning. He said he could not come then, but he would come Tuesday morning. Now, </seg>
            <seg id="p282">this Is after 1 had been dragging the road for two years. On Saturday morning I dragged the road, because it rained the day before. Monday morning the photographer u;is to come but he could not. After I had dragged the road there was the usual amount of travel upon it, — It is the custom to travel there upon Saturdays, — me usual amount that travels Sundays and on Mondays. On Monday there was 1,400 bushels of corn and seven loads of hogs besides the other travel traveled over that road. You see it here (indicating picture on frame). The photograph was taken on Tuesday morning. Now, I have had this made to show you that by the use of the drag upon that road for two years previous I had formed a crust upon that road strong enough to hold up those load's without rutting the road up. although the soil in the next mile was in that condition. (Indicating photograph.) Now, it was moist. We had been having lots of moisture that spring, yet by the use of the road drag for two years previous to that I had been able to keep the road in such a condition and form such a crust that those heavy loads the day previous to taking that, you ran see. did not rut it up at all. although every load that went over that road (indicating) had to go over that one (indicating) to get to town. Now, the next question that comes up is in reference to the cost of dragging that road : an'i I am going to tell you almost to a cent what it baa cost for the last five years. — not quite that The first year that I dragged the road I commenced in the spring. The season before it wm rounded up with a road machine. I commenced in the spring to drag that road, and for the twelve months of that year I dragged it fifteen Now. it usually takes me just about an hour to drag that road if 1 do not do any visiting. If I do visiting it takes a little longer. You know, we used to have in this state a road law wherein there was a revenue assessed against the farm land, and the farmers worked it out. and that act was repealed because the people said we were visiting out our road tax. and we were not working it out. And so if I do not visit any it takes me just about an hour. Now, the second year I dragged that road it took thirteen hours. The third year it went up to seventeen hours; the fourth year it took twelve, and the fifth year I think it was running fourteen. I have forgotten. So I have taken an average, and called it fourteen hours a year to keep this road up; and during those five years there has been no road work done on that road except what has been done with my road drag until this last fall, when we put on the road machine, but I will explain to you later the reason why It was done. Now, 1 count my time at thirty cents an hour, and this road is half a mile long; and it is on one of the main roads leading into Pawnee City, and it has to be dragged more than it would if it was not one of the main lines; so I have to make two rounds on that half mile of road, or It is equal to dragging one mile of road once. Fourteen times, an average of one hour, each for the entire season at 30 cents an hour, Is $4.20. A mile at the same rate would be $8.40 to keep that road up in that con - dition; a cost of $8.40 per mile for the entire season, and keep it in </seg>

Now. I have something here that I will show you now. It has been drawn and put upon the chart, — a mile would Jv4i&gt;. Now. 1 consider that a man living seven miles out, with good roads ran make two trips to Pawnee with his load, — seven miles away.— anil haul, if the roads are good. iin bushels, or if they are in that con dition (indicating poor road on photograph) 40 bushels is a big load Now, there is a saving of Vi. a saving of time of % by having the road in the right shape and in the right condition, which can be accomplished liy tl, the road drag with intellk ippose we are out bushels of corn to be hauled, and if ai an save one-third of ihe time we can haul that in 266% trips. It uld take 4&lt;&gt;ii loads, at 7"&gt; cents per load, if the road is in bad condition which means a loss of $3&lt;&gt;n to that community for that one job alone Now. then, out seven miles, if the road has been dragged at 30 cents an hour, as it &lt;ould be. it would cost but $58.80 for the entire year, a saving to that community alone of $241.20. Now. I see we have some corre- :.-nts here, and I hope they will get these items correctly. Several the reporters have followed me along, and they have made mis- takes with those figures, and I hope they will take pains to get those figures correct. Now, then, what do we find? We go a little farther. What das* it cost in the different counties of the state of Nebraska to keep up the dirt roails. I have shown you by my own work, my own as my diary will show, that that road has been kept up at an ex- Kor at the rate of $8.40 per mi . we have another man in ou ■ounty who has been doing more dragging of the road than 1 hav here, — Mr. Linn. He has been d Dne. I was in hopes he would be ng the road for a mile and a half right north of Pawnee City It was ny pleasure to meet him the other day. and I asked him if he had kef track of the time he had put upon the road he had been dr: c he had for two years. Now It him to ing that road a little over what it has cost me, or between $9 and $10 per mile. His farm is just out of Pawnee City; part of it comes right down into town, and I think he has done, and I know he has done a better job of dragging than what I have done. He has put on more time: yet it has cost less than $10 a mile. Now, I went through the records a short time ago, and I have been to several counties in this state and looked up the records themselves in my good roads work, and found what it has cost several counties per mile to keep up the roads, and I have them here. Now. in Jefferson county, where I visited the good roads convention, at the county seat there we found that it had cost In Jeffer - son county $19.53 per mile for every mile of laid-out road In Jefferson County, — to keep up the dirt roads. Down here (indicating photograph, </seg>
            <seg id="p284">on wall) in keeping up this road it cost only at the rate of $8.40 per mile; less than half, gentlemen, what it has cost Jefferson county to keep up her roads. And I don't believe there are any better roads in Jefferson county than what Mr. Lipp, or several others in our county have got. In Clay county I found it cost $17.36 per mile. Less than half again. Mason county $13.66; our own county, $19.71 per mile. The state of Nebraska $11.05 per mile. $11.00 has gone somewhere. 1 know where the five cents has been worked out on the road per mile. It reminds me of Fighting Bob Evans. Now, this may be an old story to you. but it Is a good one just the same. When Admiral Evans returned from the annihilation of the Spanish fleet to New York city, one pleasant Sunday morning in June he thought he would go to church. So he threw off his uniform and donned citizens clothes of a somewhat plain character, and went down to one of the fashionable churches in New York city. As he stepped inside of the church the usher did not notice him doul from the fact that he was in somewhat plain attire, as he went down the aisle and took a seat in one of the pews. Soon a lady of the arist ■ of New York city came swishing down the ainle, with her silks, satins and diamonds, and sat right down in the seat in front of Admiral Evans, and she noticed him sitting in behind. She took from Ikt &lt; ard book a card, wrote these words upon it, and bawled it over to the admiral: "I pay $2,700 a year for this pew." The admiral took from his pocket another card, wrote these words upon it. and handed it back to her: "You pay too damn much." (Applause and laughter.) What are we doing in the state of Nebraska? Are we paying too much when we can get a road, an elegant road, for less money? I think we are. Now. the road drag and how it is construrtp'1 Now, I will spend a few minutes' time upon that, and give you my ideas upon the line of the road drag. — my idea of It. Now, Edward King has done more to push the good roads problem than any other one man in the corn belt. I care not who he is. I do not think he was the inventor, but he has done more to push it than any man I know of: and when he came to our institute at Pawnee City and held up in his hand a little miniature road drag just like the one I am holding up before you, and as I saw it in his hand I felt like a mule of the long-eared variety, and if I could have turned around and kicked myself I would have done it right then. Why? I will tell you why. Because I love a good road, and many and many a time I had put my entire force onto my road machine and dragged my machine along past my place, and of course every time I did so there would come a rain and wash it and wet it all up, and the teams would come along and rut it, and my work would be lost. I saw in this little road drag an implement that I could make and drag the road whenever I wanted to. and keep It in good shape. That is the reason why. to think that I had never thought of so simple a thing to keep up the roads along - side of my place. So as soon as I could after this road meeting I com - menced to put together a road drag. And we have with us today, thank the Lord! the commissioner that I asked for a plank to make a road drag. </seg>
            <seg id="p285">aid, "Fred, there is no law covering that," and I knew there wasn't, -aid, "1 would be glad to give you one if there whs any law wherein I • ould, but 1 cant." I says. "Well, now, if you miss a plank down at the yard you will know where it can be found. It will be down to Mr. Chases's." So I took the law on my shoulder, and I went to the lumber yard and got a plank 14 feet long, 3 inches thick, and 12 inches wide, and took it over to my little shop and made a road drag. First we cut that in two in the middle and made 2 planks 7 feet long, 12 inches wide, and 3 inches thick. We bored holes in those planks just the same as 70a see here, — something like this here, and put pins in to hold them together, hitched on a chain and went ahead; and for four years I used that road drag, and then a year ago this spring I went to our commissioner again, and he said. "I will tell you what. You go down to the lumber yard, get a plank just such as you want, and take it over to the blacksmith shop and have one made just as you want it. and when the blacksmith presents that bill to the county it will be paid." Now, that was the result of the work. That is the result of what our commissioners think about this work down in Pawnee county. Now, then, since then I have used them in all kinds of shapes; but I prefer the road drag made like that one along there. Now. here is one a great many are recommending, — one made like that (indicating). I do not like it as well. You see here, and I am going to tell you why I do not like It as well. Now, in order to hare the road bed in the right kind of shape to do good business it must be something like that here. Here is a good illustration, for It is well rounded, so that when the rains come the water will run off into these ditches, and does not lie in the bed of the road at all. I hare a road drag made like that, and so instead of scraping the dirt from the center of the road I leave it in the little sort of a shape like that, right in the middle. You see? I think you can (indicating). Only, if It is made this way and dragged along the road at an angle with this part cut off here, slanting like that, instead of leaving the dirt like that you win have it more In this shape. Well, now, then if you have got a place In the middle of the road like that you have to make an extra turn to lerel it down, and if It has no taper off here, so the dirt can distribute Itaelf over the road, you are losing time, you have got to make so many trips over the road to get it into the proper shape, so I like this kind of a road drag better than that one. because that leaves it up in one place right in the center of the road, and this will distribute it over more surface. You notice here, this is steel. This Is made to represent a steel. It has to go that far, clear across the front edge. This is the one I want to do the smearing operation. Dragging and smearing is the thing, — drag and smear, and the more you smear the thicker you will get this crust, which will be Impervious to water. Now. In reference to commencing the use of the road drag. Here Is something we must not overlook: To do good work with the road drag we should first use the road machine, and grade up the proper shape here, like that (indicating). Use the road machine first because there </seg>
            <seg id="p286">is not power enough in the road drag. Then, for all time to come, you ran keep that road in repair with the road drag. Now, there is no question about it. I have used the road drag long enough, and have it used long enough to know that the road once rounded up in that form with the big road machine, you can keep it for all time to come in good shape according to the expense that is indicated right up there (indicating map); a good dirt road for less than one-half the money. Isn't that conserving something? 1 consider it so; and I am talking not from theory but from actual experience and practi' The Road Law. Now, then, I think they are all here (referring to mem - bers entering the room). I will tell you the truth about it. I don't know but mighty Httle about it, but I have tried in the last few days to find out a little something about it. and I have found out this: That we a great many times lay the poor roads to the commissioners, and they have nothing to do about it any more than you or I do. There is no law that I have been able to find that has been in force in the last three years where the commissioners have power over the road supervisors, one iota. They pay out their money. It is paid over to them, and they return to the treasurer or the county clerk whatever they have done. The commissioners, all they can do is just to notify the supervisor that there is a place there that should be attended to. They can not tell him to go and do it and he has got to go and do it. They can not tell him how to fix it. It is left entirely to him to do it; and you know what the results along that line In the last five years are in this state. Now, what I would recommend for the law would be this: That the commis - sioners should be empowered to appoint a county road engineer, and he should have the control of the roads in the county and be responsible for them to the commissioners. (Applause.) It looks to me, if I may use this kind of a way of expressing it, a good deal like going to war without a general, to fix up these roads without somebody that is the head of It to engineer it, or direct it, or whatever you may term it. There must be a head to It, and he must be a man who understands the business. Now, I have seen in our own county this thing happen: I have seen a road supervisor out with a gang of men do this: He would have hitched onto the road machine four teams at $1.50 a team for the day. which would be $6.00, — four teams. He would have three drivers for those four teams, which means $1.50 a day for each one of them, or $4.50. Then there would be himself manipulating or bossing the job at $2.50 more. Then he would have a tail end man riding on the tall end of that machine that when he turned around and one of the tugs got unhitched he would hop off and go hitch that tug, at $1.50 more. Now. there is $14.50. Now, that is what It was costing to run that road machine a day the way he was doing It. Now, I have seen another man who understood the business, knew what he was about, take two teams, which would be $3.00, one man to drive them, which would be $1.50. and he himself managing the machine and the job, $2.50 more. Now, you have got $7.00. Now, this man was actually </seg>
            <seg id="p287">287 ■ more good in a day than tho other man was. Why? Simply be - he knew how. Now. that was all there was about it. \ Member: Did he have a smaller grader? Mr. Chase: The same grader. It is because he knew how to handle it. I bring this up to illustrate the necessity of having what I call road experts to do this work. These road experts can be appointed by the county road engineer, who has been appointed by the commissioners. I would have it an appointive office every time, regardless of politics or religion in every instance, and then if he didn't do the business, why. ■■Hid turn him out and get another man that could do the business, ing of $7.50. Now, then, I do not know. A great many times the on has come up, we are not having tunds enough raised. There i«n"t a large enough revenue to defray the expenses of road building. Before I would go to work to raise any more funds for keeping up the roads in 'he state of Nebraska, I would go to work to train some men. get items cf the funds paid, and get better roads with the same amount of money than we have now at the present time. That is what I would do, and that is what I would recommend. The only way to secure good roads or any fairer return for money expended on roads is to provide a thorough - ly organized administration of road work by trained expert road makers. Now, that is my idea of it. As I said before, we must have men that understand this work. Just as much as a railroad or corporations of SJiy kind must have men who understand their work. These road super I, while the majority will try to do. they are all human Just like the rest of us, they have not been trained along that line, and consequently it is necessary in order to have these funds appropriated as they should be and expended as they should be to have it in the hands of thoroughly competent men. As I have traveled over the eastern part of the state of Nebraska I find wherever I go and the road drag has been used that it is universally the one modern implement of keeping up the dirt ro»d in eastern Nebraska, so much so that many, many towns and some vil - lages have raised money and had these road drags made and put them to use in and about the towns to keep up the streets in good shape and the roads around about. And the president of one commercial club told me, with his own mouth, that that club never expended so little an amount of money for advertising that did as much good as the money they had expended for road drags and the use of them upon the roads leading into their towns, because it brought the travel that way. Our own town has spent considerable money. Two or three years ago they bought a team, paying $400 for the team, and put it in the hands of the town marshal and had him drag the road. The town marshal owns the team now, and hands in his bill. He drags the roads, and believe we come as near having a macadamized road as any town. ■Member: This team that was bought for the purpose of dragging oads was bought by individuals by subscription, and turned over to own marshal. It was not owned by the city. Mr. Chase: That is rignt. It was bought by private subscription, and </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 PROCKKPINGS NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE they paid $20 apiece. There were twenty of them. I remember now. Paid $20 apiece, or $400 for that team, and it was turned over to the i ity marshal to drag the streets of Pawnee City, and I will tell you what. we come nearer to having paved streets than any other town in this that don't have them. It never ha6 been my privilege to go into a town that comes as near having them as we do. Now, then, good roads put a value on the community that is not a question of dollars and cents. And I can not find a better way of illustrating it than this: We will suppose we are looking for a new location for our home. We perhaps have sold out, or perhaps we want to buy a home, and we start out to find a new home in some locality in this beautiful state of ours. Now. God in Hi~ beneficence pretty nearly made the surface of Nebraska all very nearly alike, particularly in the eastern part of the state; but as we go out to look, the agent, the land agent takes us into a certain locality, and what do we find? The first thing that we notice is the condition of the roads. In this particular locality the water is coming right down in the center of the road where the travel should be, and the travel is in the ditches where the water should be. The road sides are abrupt. Instead of being a steady slope as this represents, they are abrupt, and you can not take your mowing machine and trim them up. They are unkempt and untidy; they are growing up with weeds, and the hedges, if there are any, are not trimmed at all, and the corn is in the same way. The fences along these roads are in an unkempt condition, the wires are loose, the posts are uneven, and a great many of them rotted off, and the farms are in the same condition. You will see there is no thrift, and there is no agri - cultural interest, if you will express it that way. They are not con - serving their interests in keeping up the fertility of their soil. The outbuildings are in an untidy and ridiculous shape; and in many in - stances you will note that they have either got to move the barn pretty soon or get out the manure.

Oh! so different, and yet God in His nature made one just the s-ame as the other; but here you will llnd the travel on those roads goes in the center where it should be, and they are in a well-kept condition, so that the water runs off in the drain and down the ditches, and the roadsides, instead of being abrupt, they are oval, in this shape (indicating), and they can be kept trimmed and kept tidy and neat. And the fences are up and in straight lines, and the wires are drawn up tight and neat, and the yards look tidy. The front yards, instead of being a mud hole in the front for the razor-back and the ducks and geese to wallow in, have a beautiful lawn spread over with green grass and beautiful flowers. The outbuildings and the barns are in the same condition. Here we find splendid orchards. Everything shows thrift and intelligence. Even though you may not see the people that are located in this particular community you know they are of a broad, intellectual kind and the kind you want to associate with and are </seg>

Gentle - men of this Conservation and Development Congress, which will you choose? I thank you for your kind attention. (Applause.) i Whereupon the following discussion in the form of questions and n took place:) Q. At what time should these roads be dragged? When they are wet or when they are dry? A. Sir? Q. When they are wet? A. Yes Q. How wide a road do we need? A four rod wide roai A. No. Q. I would like to ask one question in regard to this drag, Mister. What is the time after a rain that you would drag the road, — when it is real wet or when it is just moist? A. The time that I drag the road is not when it is real wet If I could drag it when it is real wet and have the teams keep off of it until the sun had baked it hard, then would be my time to drag it. but I can't, so I have to wait until it is partially dry. and the ruts and what little hum - mocks of dirt the horses' feet have punched up will crumble fairly well, and as I go along with my road drag the front board levels those off and fills up the holes and the rear one smears it over. Now, there is enough moisture left so that the front board cuts and levels it off and the rear one does the smearing. Q. Do you ever have any trouble with the road drag slewing sidewise and going around these bunches of mud that comes off the wagon wheels? BNo; I haven't had any of those big bunches of mud since I began ng the road. Q. Didn't they tear them up when you first commenced, before you your road in good condition like that? A. Yes; I had to take a shovel along Q. Did you have trouble running around those big bunches of mud? A. Yes. I had to take a shovel along. Q. Did you ever have any experience with very sandy roads? A. Not very much. Q. What about the difference in soil? A. I want to say with reference to that that the state of Nebraska has several different kinds of soil, and it will be absolutely necessary, before we can say what is the beet thing to do for the given road, what is the best thing to do for the different soils of the road, in some parts </seg>
            <seg id="p290">■ II have to use a different process than in other parts of the state, — to experiment and see what is best Bessor Condra: I wish some of you would bring up the question i question of people hauling over the roads before it is time, heard a good many men in this state who have been dragging the complain, and they have become discouraged, because a neighbor iver the roads at the wrong lime, and he made those gutters. Mr. Chase: Drag It again. Now, Doctor, our commissioner here has answered that. He says if every fellow will drag his road there will not be much of that. Professor Condra: Good. I remember of talking to a meeting down to Tecumseh a few days ago. where there was a great deal of interest, and that was the thing they were greatly discouraged over, that certain men in the community did not have enough public spirit to realize that there are times when you ought to keep the very heaviest loads off of that road. There are times when you can leave things and go down to town, but these men would take a heavy load and go to town over this road and make great ruts in it. Mr. Chase: Ine only resort is to drag them again and fill them up. they are bound to do that. It seems like that is the nature of man the world over. We have some of them In our community. The only thing is to go ahead and do the best you can. It seems awfully discouraging to me sometimes to keep the dragging of this road. I never asked the commissioners to pay me anything. They have always felt very grate ful to me. It seems to me that some of my neighbors have not helped until last year they have taken up this work between my house and the town; so much so that it la not in that shape now (referring to picture of badly rutted road). They are dragging that road. Now, we have as good roads down in our part as any in any part; if not the best. Q. Do you want to put any weight on the drag? A. Yes, Fir; weight it according to the conditions. You will soon learn how to weight it. You will soon learn how to weight it after you get out on the road. Q. Isn't it a fact that a great many try to keep up too wide a road, too wide a grade to be dragged? A. Yen Q. What width In your experience would you suggest? A. I went out and measured tnis less than a week ago to see, and I have eighteen feet, and that is plenty of room for two teams to pass. One can go ahead of the other or meet or anything of the kind. I have eighteen feet there. Now, the most of the roads in the state of Nebraska, only one trip is necessary, down and back, and yet the main road leading from town to town or into town, require two tripe down and back to keep up the road bed. and that is enough, but the large majority, a large per cent of the roads of Nebraska only need one trip down, or for just what it cost here to keep up a half-mile, one mile could have been kept up. — for the same expense. </seg>
            <seg id="p291">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 291 Professor Condra: Now, gentlemen, there is a statement here that probably a few missed. It costs Nebraska $11 and something to keep up the roads. Those roads are not kept up. Now, do not fail to keep that in mind. The roads in the condition in which we have them costs that. Now, good roads cost what? Mr. Chase has told you what they cost. There is a vast difference between not keeping them up and keeping up the roads; in other words, having bad roads and having good roads. Why. we could have good roads for less money than what we have had roads for. Now, that is to be kept in mind. K Chase: Another thing, the state of Nebraska has hundreds of miles ave not been opened yet. that are called laid out roads. Section ire called laid out roads. All they have to do is to open the fences t them in there. . . . Q. Mr. Chase, you haven't taken into consideration at all the first grading of that road, have you? A. No, sir; just keeping it up after it is fixed ■ What is the cost? Have you ever figured that up? Yes, sir; I have figured that up. Q. Is it cheaper KNot cheaper. It runs a great deal according to the kind of man nt in there to grade that up the first time. If you put a man that $14.50 a day how much can he grade in a day? That answers the on, — whether you put that one or one that can grade it for $7.00 How much can he grade? That answers the question easier than tell you. You know how much the team can do. Q. The condition of the road at the sides would make quite a difference. A. Yes, sir; it would Q. How often do you use the road grader? A. Use the road grader once, and after that you can always keep it in repair with the road drag; never but once. Q. What per cent of the roads ought to be kept up in good shape? In other words, roads go in section lines. What per cent ought to be kept in good shape? ■ You have got me on that. Does any one know? ■ Member: One hundred per cent You think so really? A Member: All of them Q. All of them; all these section lines? r ember: Oh, no. Not every section line is a public highway. I know, but a good many of them are. A Member: Every road. Q. Every road that any one has to travel? A Member: Every road that any one has to travel by directly to get his products to the town or to get to his neighbors. Professor Condra: You are very liberal. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">K ember: Do like the railroads, keep up the main lines before the es. ■ressor: What does the supervisor do if he lives down in a alley? Mr. Chase: He would keep up a good road. He generally works the road right next to where he lives. Q. I gather from what you say about this road, that it is not the great amount of time and the cost, but it is to do it when it is necessary. Have you ever given a thought to how the supervisors could be appointed to look over the road so that they could be in all parts of the precinct to give those roads the required amount of attention? A. You should be at the right place to give it the required amount of attention. Q. You should be at the right place to give it the required amount of attention? A. Yes, sir ■ I understand; and it is the old adage that "A stich in time sav I would like to hear a little something on that. A. I guess 1 can answer It right here in about as good a way as any Ilember: I do not rise for the purpose of speaking. I just simply to ask a question. Now, I have lived in this county from 1869 to but as I have been here and there I am at a loss to know definitely ler or not the section line there was a law providing for sec - nes being public roads. Has that been repealed? A. What is that? K ember: There has something been said here with regard to the lines not being public roads any longer. How is that? Has that sn repealed? A. I did not know that it had. A Voice: I think I can answer that Mr. Chase: All right. Let the gentleman answer Koice: The section lines may be public roads when the comni ■clare the necessity of opening them and providing for the appraifse - and payment of damages occasioned thereby. Until then they are lblic roads. K Chase: This gentleman's question over here. I would like to that, and I can not answer it any better than to read this little "The only way to secure good roads or any fair return for money ed on roads, is to provide a thoroughly organized administration work by trained, expert road employees." That is my idea of it. I Member: I think that Mr. Chase takes too rosy a view of this line and the work it is capable of doing. There is a great deal of that the machine can not do. There are thousands of miles of roads Is state that are not drained, that for a period of not less than three hs in the year you can not work them. Machines will flatten them lat,— will flatten them out flat. They have to be periodically ditched </seg>
            <seg id="p293">293 and graded up. The drag is not a sovereign remedy for chuck holes. A man must go with a shovel and wagon and fill those up. On hill sides, say. a wagon wheel will make a ditch that gets the drainage in the middle, and that works the drain in the middle of the road where the ground is hard and your drag will not take hold of it. That is some - thing that has to be handled in another way altogether. There are vast areas of sandy roads in the state that it will not work on. Of course, Mr. Chase, presupposes that we have subteiranean drainage, or what we call subsoil drainage, in his road, and he has taken care of the surface water that falls on that, including the rainfall, the periodical rainfall. He has taken care of the road as he finds it in his locality, but where he gets a valley where you go forty or fifty miles with probably eigteen or twenty or thirty miles with water in the ground up to within ten to eighteen inches of the surface of the road, his road drag is not a remedy. The road drag is an old, old contrivance that was used fifty years ago on the race track. That is where it had its origin. It is a wonder it has not been applied sooner to the development of our roads; but on the race tracks they use when the ground is soft a harrow to let In the air and break it up, and follow that with this drag. Kman Chatburn: Now, gentlemen, we have another talk her* on bject of drainage, and then we have, after these set talks, we hare ce for general discussion, and I think we better let the general ion go until that time, and then everybody will have a chance. Ii Chairman: Now, gentlemen, we have a general discussion. We two men, after which It will be a free "pitch In", and we hope that body will take part in the discussion. — one at a time, of course. To this discussion I am going to call on a man who knows a good road he sees it, and he will give us a short, snappy talk. Everything be short from now on. Mr. Leonard (of Pawnee): Mr. Chairman: I feel something like the president of the commercial club did a while ago. I do not like to talk to so many men at one time. If there Is any man here that Is pessimistic enough to think that we do not need good roads, if he will come down to Pawnee county where I live, and come out in the front yard with me under a big elm tree there. I will convince him that we need good roads, for I can talk and convince one man at a time. If I can't convince him by talking to him I will take him in a buggy, and I will not have to drive far to show him the good roads we have in Pawnee county. In the first place, some of those pessimistic farmers claim that this good roads agitation is going to increase our taxes. Well, now, perhaps it will Increase it a little. I remember on one occasion of being in Lincoln with one of my intimate friends of Pawnee connty. He lives in Pawnee City today. It must be twenty years ago. As we walked up here by the University he says, "There is where we have got a lot of our money planted." Now, if we had not planted our money there we would not have had today so many intelligent young men and women in the country. If we do not plant some money in these good roads we will </seg>
            <seg id="p294">go on for the balance of time as we have in the last fifty years. Well, something; over a month ago I had occasion to make a trip southeast of Pawnee City, and invited this same friend of mine to go with me in the buggy. It was just when the frost was coming out of the ground. There is a mile of road about two miles east of Pawnee City on the north side of the — or off of the main road that lies adjacent to the land that is owned by five different men. Three of those men are energetic enough to keep this mile of road in good shape. Going out to the point we wanted to make we took what we call the main traveled road, and it was pretty muddy. This party was complaining about the bad roads. I says, as we were coming back. "Here is a mile of road that is the worst I know of in Pawnee county. It has never been worked since I have known it, and I have known it for thirty years. We will drive through this mile of road and take the lower, that has been taken good care of. and we will save time that way." We drove through that mile of road, and I think there were places where we went through clear up to the hub of the buggy wheels. It is as level a mile I think as any in Pawnee county. Then we came to this mile of good road, and there we could drive right along. It had been dragged for the last four years, — first graded with a road grader and got in good shape, largely by donated work. When I came to this mile I knew It was a good road. I think a good team could have gone over there in four minutes, when you couldn't hardly have gone four miles in four hours on some of the roads around there. Those good roads would surely aave a good deal of time. This same gentleman who waa thinking we had our money piled up in the University, although we had put it in but a little at a time, said he did not know why they didn't levy enough taxes to make all the roads like this (referring to the good road) and hire men to put it there. Did you ever stop to think how much money we pay the farmers for making these good roads, or bad roads, I should say. for that is what we generally have? We had a farmers' institute down in our town, and Brother Chase, — Fred Chase we call him down there. Perhaps these road men call him Brother. They seem to be at - tached to him, — and he was to make a speech, and after he had made his talk and some of them had really disputed what he had told them about the cost of these roads, I took the trouble to go over to our treas - urer's office and find out how much money each quarter-section of our county was paying into the general road fund to keep up the dirt roads. — that would be outside of bridges and culverts. I took four quarter-sec - tions out of each township in our county and added the sums together and divided by the number of quarter-sections, and I found that we were paying $3.51 on each quarter-section. That would be an average of $3.51 that goes into the general road fund. That would be the land tax. The poll tax, — I don't remember how much for each township. But the poll tax and the road taxes levied on the personal property gave us about $1,400 to make these dirt roads in our county. Now, if we pay this $3.51 we only have to make one trip, by these figures (referring to diagram on wall), to save enough time to make that $3.51. Two tripe would let </seg>
            <seg id="p295">g$7 on this seven miles. I think we would earn the money in the lat we lose in a very short time to pay this extra tax. My idea be, as somebody has asked, "What road would you make first? " I make the rural routes good first. Then I would make the roads good leading from one town to another, and then I would make the side roads good as fast as our finances would admit of; and it wouldn't be but a few years, if we doubled our taxation for road purposes, but what we would have good roads; but this we can not do until we have a legislature that will come up here to Lincoln and make laws, and made by men that are not afraid to go home and say, "I have done you some good. I have spent your money, but I have done you some good." The majority of fel - lows we send up here to Lincoln are afraid of their constituency; when they get home they say, "Yes, we appropriated some money," and they don't like to say much about the appropriation. It takes taxes to pay that. We want men who will make appropriations for these roads, and who will not be afraid to go home and say, "We have spent your money, and we have done you some good." Something has been said about the low land. Between my place and town we have a creek to cross. It Is about a quarter of a mile across the bottom from the creek to the foot of the hill. Water cover* that fre - quently, — whenever we have high water. About six years ago the com - missioners got a little extra money to work on that bottom, and that piece of bottom road. The adjacent farmers donated some work; the town of Pawnee donated a little money. They threw up a grade there about three feet and a half high. Now that was just from one little stream that runs Into this main creek, between that stream and the main creek; it was probably 40 rods long, this grade was. The young man who owned the farm adjacent to this road dragged this road for some three years, and that grade had not perceptibly worn down at all while he was using that road drag on it. Some of the rest of the people that lived along that road quit dragging it ; and I don't know why he did, but he quit anyhow. Since then that grade has mashed down. There has been nothing done to keep the dirt In the middle of the road, and It has worn down until this spring, when the frost went out, there was a place there that there wasn't an automobile scared a team for four weeks, — they couldn't get through. Now, I see just lately that they have worked that road some. If any of you will go down into Pawnee county, or into any other county, as far as that is concerned, if you find any of those men that have enthusiasm enough to make these good roads near by their farms, I will guarantee that if you are either sight-seeing or if you are there to buy a farm, and your friend or real estate dealer goes to take you out through the country to show you any of these farms he will go over one of those good pieces of road every time. In fact, do with you something like an automobile driver we have got in our town. He is quite an automobile enthusiast and he goes to the little town of Summerfield, Kansas, frequently on busi - ness, — his business calls him over there. Now, from our town to Sum - merfield is eighteen miles, but by going eight miles further and making </seg>
            <seg id="p296">Brenty-six mile trip he tan cut out several big hills and several pieces road. He always makes the trip on this twenty-six mile route in - of going directly the eighteen miles, and if you had these roads as ve at least six miles of road that I know of in Pawnee county you never have to make that extra distance to save the time. You go over the roads if they are all like this six miles. w, I do not think the conditions are the same in all these cases in making dirt roads. Now. we have about thirty creeks in our county; but we haven't any main traveled roads that run parallel with those CK The section lines run north and south and east and west, but there are none of these creeks that run directly north and south or east and west; and we do not have a section line in very many places that runs parallel with the creeks except lor but a very short distanc e. So we have enough what we call upland road all over the county only when crossing these creeks. So there is the problem perhaps we will face in making these good roads; but on the upland roads, and I think at least 75 if not 90 per cent of the roade in the state of Nebraska are upland roads, Is where you can use this road drag successfully on. I know, for I have seen it, and after the road is prepared. Now, this piece of road, I have driven over it, I don't know how often, but It was not a great while ago, nor more than a month ago, when the frost was coming out, I drove over this road and I *aw a man hauling a load of native lumber over this particular half mile of road (referring to picture on wall) ; he was going north. Some one spoke about the wheel tracks. Now, i don't know how much weight he had on that wagon, but I think anyhow 3,800 pounds. He had on a good load of native lumber, and you couldn't see a track that he made an inch deep there; and this piece of road, which lies directly north. As soon as he came to that there were ruts cut. Here is the picture of them (re - ferring to picture on wall). I do not think these are the same ones, though, that were there this spring that this picture represents, for this was taken years ago. Now, he spread his team apart and put a wheel in here and one in here, in the horses' tracks, and left two wheel tracks be - tween, and that ground was apparently dry on top, but it was soft enough and spongy enough that he made a track at least two inches deep with that load of lumber in these horse tracks. Now, that road at one time was graded until it was in pretty good shape. Mr. Chase: At the same time that was, colonel. Mr. Leonard: Mr. Chase says at the same time that this was. I didn't remember the date. I know I have seen it when it was graded and in good shape, yet nothing was done with it after it was graded until right recently they are dragging on that road now. Well, it lacks several Inches of being up as high in the middle as this road does from the fact that it is worn off by travel, and wet weather possibly. It may be the mud carried off in a rain did it. Now, it isn't as high in the center as this road, and his road drag will not do as much good on that road today as it will on this, from the fact that it is more level in the center of the road. With the same amount of rain, I would guarantee you that on this </seg>
            <seg id="p297">PROCEKmXOS XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 297 half mile of road you may take a two-inch rain. — that is quite a rain in twenty-four hours, — after a two-inch rain falls on this road, and it is once dragged, you can haul any ordinary loud that a farmer hauls without wearying his team a particle, but when he comes to this piece of road the wheels will go right down, after a rain of that kind. I hare seen that. I know that is so; and I am in favor of good roads and lots of good roads. You have often heard it said, and no doubt hear it every day, that the farmer can not get help; that the young men are all going to the cities. Mr. Selleck says there are lots of them going back to the country. We do not see them coming, though. I have lived in the country ever since I was born. I do nut see them coming that way. Most are leaving us; and I don't know what is the reason of it. I do not know whether it Is because we have not got accommodations in the country to take care of these young men that you have in the cities, but from a financial stand - point I know that we are doing them justice. On our own farm at home we are paying a man $30 a month the year round. We feed a good horse for him, and keep it fat, and furnish him a shed to keep his buggy in. We do his washing. If he wants to go to town Saturday afternoon we say, "All right, John. Go along. We have got nothing particular today." We pay him for that time that he goes to town; and by the time we (at through paying him we have paid him about $75 or $80 a month. Now, I know that there are thousands of young men in Lincoln and other cities the size of Lincoln that are working for less than $75 or $80 a month, and I know that they can not save this $30 that our farm hand can save. And I believe if we had more good roads for those farm hands to pull these buggies over that we do shed for them, that we would have more of them out there doing the farm work Instead of trying to do work in the city. Now, I Imagine that if you would put out a sign, Miller &amp; Paine, Rudge * Ouentel, or some of these other big firms up here would put out a sign that they wanted twenty-five young men to go to work at some particular work in their establishment they would have plenty of applicants. Per - haps they would not be competent to take the places; but if we were to put out a sign on the farm that we want ten good men to go to work there, we will not have one single applicant, but I believe If we had these good roads and the facilities for them to get back from our places to the«e towns for recreation they would come our way Instead of going yours. (Applause.) Doctor Condra: I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, from this on that you have a watch and any kind of a mallet, and hit it hard. The Chairman: We will from now on have a limited time to give you. Five minutes for the first man. Mr. Patrick (Sarpy county): I am a good roads crank, and I can not resist the temptation to bore you a few moments. I want to deny the proposition that there is any method of maintaining dirt roads that equals the King road drag when intelligently used. (Applause.) The remarks of my friend Wooster remind me of what Mark Twain once said about </seg>
            <seg id="p298">the hanging of a certain individual, that it helped a little. Probably his harrow with tooth set and teeth reversed might help a rough piece of road some; but the principle of operating the King road drag is the same principle that is used when troweling the morfar on the wall; and if you wait until the road is so rough that you can not travel it to use the King road drag, you are not doing the road any good. The system of using the King road drag requires its use as soon as it can be used after each rain or wet spell. And by its continued use after first rounding up the road, working the ground when it is in that plastic condition that mortar is in when you spread it on the wall, you keep working the dirt toward the center and disintegrating the particles and plastering coat after coat on the roadway until finally it becomes impervious to moisture, and you have a dirt roadway that is equal to a macadam road or an asphaltum pave - ment, and a road that the freezing and frost of the winters does not affect. Now, a few words with reference to what is necessary to accomplish these results: In the first place you must select representatives to the legislature who are capable of realizing the necessities of the people in the communities that they represent. (Applause.) Before that you mutt exercise a little brain power yourselves in selecting those representatives. Tou must act along non-partisan lines and select men who have the brains and the ability rather than those who belong to the political party with which you affiliate. I had the privilege, If not the misfortune, at one time to try to rewrite the road laws of Nebraska. I spent about three months in endeavoring to perfect a bill, somewhat along the lines of some of the suggestions here today. I introduced it in the senate at the thirtieth ses - sion, and they practically gave me the right of way there, and we passed it almost unanimously. It reached the house. I think we had spent something like a week in perfecting it in the senate. It reached the house and encountered a coterie of old-fashioned road overseers who knew more about road building than all of the scientific men have ever discovered, and they disposed of it in forty seconds; and the only road laws you have got today that enable you to have good roads in any part of Nebraska are the amendments that we tacked onto the bills originating in the senate that session and forced them to swallow. It, another suggestion that I wish to offer is that there should be a 1 wheel tax upon every vehicle traversing the public highways. The irho runs a vehicle with an inch or inch and three-quarters or two - ire on it should be required to pay a greater amount of tax upon 'ehicle than the man who runs a vehicle with a wider tire, because narrow tire is destructive of good roads; the wider tire the more cial the traffic to your roads. Eier thing you must do in order to secure the cooperation of men te roads is not to be afraid to enforce the law. Today we have a road law than we ever had in Nebraska, but it is yet Imperfect, ad overseer in a great many communities undertakes to secure md men to work upon the highways. Sometimes he secures them metimes they tell him they are too busy. If that road overseer </seg>
            <seg id="p299">Ie nerve to exercise his prerogatives, he would say to Mr. Jim Jones r. John Smith, "Here, I want you on this piece of road tomorrow ig at 8:00 o'clock." Under the law they have got to go or be fined. 1 overseer is afraid they will not vote for him the next time he Is lidate for election, and consequently he does the work on the high - when he can secure men and teams who are willing to work and lothing else to do; otherwise the work goes undone. Now, I think I have about used up my time, but there is one other sug m I wish to make. In the first place, you should have a state super - intendent of highways in order that the work in the entire state should be systematized. Next, you should have a county superintendent of high - ways, and all of the district overseers should be under his supervision. Then the work of maintaining the roads with the King road drag should be required. When the amendments were passed at the thirtieth session it was the intention of the legislature that the portion of the road tan at the disposition of the commissioners should be for the purpose of con - structing or improving dirt roads, and that part of the road tax at the disposition of the road overseers should be used for their maintenance exclusively. Under the present law one-half of all of the road tax levied and collected in the county is at the disposition of the county commis - sioners, to be divided equally among the several road districts. That la for the purpose of getting the roads under the contract system, grading down hills, and using the old side-hill grader upon the road. Half of all of the road tax and all of the labor tax belongs exclusively to the road district where that sum is levied, and that is under the disposition of the overseer merely for the maintenance of his road ; and that should be done exclusively with the King road drag after the roads have first been rounded up with the road machine. 19 is a subject, gentlemen, upon which one who is Interested can oc - \ great deal of time, but I realize that there are others who wish to ere this afternoon, and I thank you for the attention yon have given (Applause.) Eessor Coupland: . . . Mr. Herron Is very anxious that Pro - should occupy this five minutes. It Is very courteous of him to , but I am sure that every one of us want to hear from the nestor servation in Nebraska, Professor Hunt. Eessor E. W. Hunt: Gentlemen of the Convention: It would be i for me to say I am very much interested in this question of con - ion; but the particular phase of the question that interests me Is nservatlon of the fertility that is in our soil. I.nt to start at the bottom of this with a statement that you can not something out of nothing. You have a growing plant, a small one. :ains a certain amount of material. When it Is grown to Its full site atured and cropped it contains a certain increased amount of ma- This material came from somewhere. It came from the soil, that plant is grown there is less of that material remaining in the </seg>
            <seg id="p300">soil than there was before. Unless that material is returned to the soil there will be permanently leu remaining in the soil than there was be - fore. If this is continued long enough the material will be exhausted to such an extent that it ( an no longer produce a profitable crop. That is what we have been doing in the state 01 Nebraska ever since the state was opened to agriculture. Especially on our higher lands. I am not speaking of our ievel valleys where the supply is so much greater, but on the higher lands in tl ml we have been taking a certain defi - nite amount from the soil every year, and have been practically return - ing nothing of it to the soil. — and the end is not far to see. I feel as though we have reached the danger point in this matter, and it is time for us to turn our attention from production to maintenance. I like to hear the question of conservation discussed on the basis of conservation pure and simple, and not on the basis of creating an opportunity for in - creased production. Now. the thing for us to do is to begin to put back into the soil what we have taken out of it; and that is something that we are not doing. There are hundreds of thousands of tons at this moment of the best fertilizer, barn-yard fertilizer, in the world that is going to waste on Nebraska farms, simply because the men will not use it. The time is coming, — it is not far distant, — when the first business of every farmer in Nebraska will be, not the production of the greatest amount of cereals, but the production of the greatest possible amount of barn - yard fertilizer on every farm In the state of Nebraska (applause), assured that if he does that the production will afterwards take care of itself. The first business is to convert every possible amount of waste and rough - ace on the farm into fertilizer. In one of the principal wheat-growing counties in this state last year they told me that 95 per cent of their straw stacks were burned every year. That is an economic crime. I want to create a public sentiment that will brand a man as an enemy to his people who will burn straw on his farm. In another county they told me that 75 per cent of their straw piles were burned every year. I want to create a public sentiment in this state that will make a man feel that he is unworthy a place in the community who will deliberately destroy,— who will become in that sense an agricultural vandal in the state of Ne - braska, where so much of that soil food is needed. Whatever comes from the soil we must put back into the soil, or the future is going to suffer for the result. Now. 1 want you gentlemen to go home and urge upon those men that the first business of every farmer i.s to make on his farm ail the fertilizer that he can possibly make. Ther-? is only one other way to get out of it. If he will not do that and return to the farm that iden - tical plant food that his crop took from the soil, then he must purchase somewhere in the market the equivalent of that food, plant food, to put back into the soil, or his soil will be that much poorer. This rests on a deeper foundation than selfishness. It is a broad altruism. The future owns a certain indefensible, incontestible right to the fertility that is in our soil. You feel, if you own a warranty deed to a piece of land that you own the land and can destroy it or do anything you please with it. </seg>

            <seg id="p302">Fanner," and among other questions I asked some questions in regard. to the Kinkaid homesteader, how they were succeeding, and what per cent of the Kinkaid homesteaders would be able to prove up on their filings. I will just take the balance of the time that I have to read some of these communications. I have got a lot of these, but I am not going to annoy you with all of it by any means. Now, I will give you a key to these in a kind of a general way, where they are from, but not the names of the writers. I got this information from reliable men, and it is just exactly as they saw the proposition, and I have the consent of one of the writers since I came here, and he said. "You can use my name." But I haven't the consent of the others, and I will give it to you by counties. Now, the first one we will use will be Cherry county. This gentleman says: "Replying to your favor with reference to the results of the Kinkaid law in this part of the state, will say that I believe in the main it has been largely beneficial. At first it upset the prevailing conditions and largely affected the values of ranch property, but conditions have adjusted them - selves, and I believe it to have been a good thing for this section of the Inds within twenty or thirty miles of the railroad, filed on under the iid homestead law, are In the main owned by the people who filed them, and fully fifty per cent of the settlers are making final proof eir homesteads." Now, you will observe that that is a pretty good showing, when you take into consideration the quality of the land. Now, all locations up in that country are not alike. It is the most diversified country in the mat - ter of quality that any one in this state certainly knows of who is ac - quainted with it. And there is another factor that enters into success or failure with the Kinkaid homesteader, and that is the quality of the man. Now, that very same thing prevailed when this country down here was being homesteaded. Of the men who went on homesteads not all stayed. Any amount of them all over the state of Nebraska pulled up and moved out under the old 1 fin-acre proposition; and we find the same condition existing with men in the 640-acre proposition. There are any amount of men who went in there that didn't have any money when they located. When they got on their homesteads, why, they hadn't anything to live on. Well, now, how can a man of that kind live there for five years without anything to start on? It was a bad business proposition for the people in the first place. Well, now, that makes up for a class of those fellows that are constantly coming up and getting out, or selling their relinquish- I.tlnuing reading) "Congressman Kinkaid's plan of buying isolated of 480 acres or less is doing more than anything else to settle the m of the remaining government land In this section of the country, illy trouble is in sections where there are large tracts that are unfit for farming, and upon which homesteaders will not settle, □s to me that after the operation of the Kinkaid law for a definite of time that the best way to settle this problem would be to sell </seg>
            <seg id="p303">the lands to the state and allow the state to handle it as it does the school lands." Now, you see this fellow is offering a recommendation. That was Cherry county. Now, I have one from Sheridan county: I regard to the Kinkaid homesteader the majority of them could not r exist if it were not for the old-time ranchman giving them em - snt in putting up hay and feeding cattle in winter. Those who have enough to buy some stock and have located in a good valley, can long, but can not expect to get much ahead. A good many have claims expecting to prove up and sell out and get out of the coun - do not believe there will be 25 per cent of them stay and prove up ake a permanent home. I posing of the remaining government land is a perplexing question, g outfits want all the land and are working as hard as ever to get to head them off is hard to do. About the only safe way to dis - f the land is to sell it to the small homesteader on long time, at a able rate of interest, and make it non-transferable for a number rs, in order to bar the big fellow, for they are bound to have the f it is possible for them to get it. Iis in favor of leasing at one time, subject to homestead, but that not be satisfactory, for the simple reason that a person would not &gt;re than get it fenced until some one would file on it for spite, if 5 else. I have been here for twenty-three years, and there is more sfaction now in running stock than there was a few years ago, as lge is such that cattle must b &lt; kept in fenced inclosures or close on the range." Here is one from Cheyenne county: "As a rule the Kinkaid homesteaders in this section will be successful if the government is not too strict with them in regard to living on their claims, as a great many of them have to go away from home to work in order to make a living. "I think about 75 per cent of the homesteaders in this locality will be able to prove up. The most of the homesteaders at present are in very good condition "I hardly feel in position to give information in regard to the disposal of government land in the sandhills, as I am not in that immediate vicin- Now, here is one from Box Butte county referring to the prospects of success of those whom we call Ed homesteaders. The great mass have made a dismal failure, and . have no intention of making a home any longer than they can up and get away. About half are relinquishing, and some other is trying the same thing over again." — It means filing on the sane "In many instances the land has changed hands two, three, and mes by relinquishing. "This applies to the new people who came In here and were unfamiliar with the country. The land that was taken by people who lived here and </seg>
            <seg id="p304">where the parties already had real estate holdings and where the land produced the native bay, the range land taken by them has been an as - sistance and this class of men will stay and succeed." Now, you will understand that this applies in a great measure, although it doesn't just exactly say so, — it applies In a great measure to the settlers who were in there before the Kinkaid homestead law became operative. Brasionally we have men come in with some property and have se - other land, or occasionally a family has taken several sections and ock and money to go on and have been fairly successful, but it ap - that one section of range land is of but little value by itself. "I do not believe there will be five per cent of the new people who will stay here when proven up. "The sandhill country is nothing but a grazing country, and the range land must finally go to the owner of the natural hay valleys. The two put together will make a fair home, but separate them and neither Is of much value. "I believe the remaining government land should be sold and allowed to pass the patent, and that which Is held now by homestead should be encouraged to patent by giving the homesteader the mo6t liberal con - struction of the law." Now, then, this man remarks in a discouraging way that he is not a permanency there at all. and that there is a very small percentage that are going to prove up and stay there. You see. he would like to have conditions different. He would like to have all those homesteaders prove up and turn this land to title property. Now, that seems to be the pre - vailing sentiment with all those people up in that country. They would like to see all of that unoccupied or unappropriated government land put in such a shape as to become title property, or have it controlled in such a way as it would be a source of revenue to the state. It is a very un - fortunate condition that there are millions of acres of land up there now that are not producing a cent of revenue to the state of Nebraska, either in land or school districts, even; not producing anything, and it is really not available to the cattlemen because the Kinkaid homesteaders are lo - cated around in such a way that he can not turn his cattle loose, and the cattlemen realize the fact that close herding is a damage to cattle. They haven't been used to it, and they never will get used to it. This thing of close herding with the cattlemen, you know, is a thing of the past. Now, here is one from Sheridan county. I am going to read two from Sheridan county. One is from the north end and one from the south end of the county; and you who understand the location of these counties will realize that Sheridan county is as big as two counties: Eink that not over 5 per cent of the Kinkaid homesteaders in this the state will be able to prove up on their filings. I believe that the remaining government lands subject to homestead entry is t disposition to be made of these lands. Then a homesteader has vilege at any time in tryine his hick in acquiring title to the land, Ise it will be produc ii mm and thousands more cattle will </seg>
            <seg id="p305">be produced on these lands than under present conditions." You see this gentleman is in favor of a leasing proposition, and he is willing to pay for it in order to get the security. — be able, to fence his land and have the pasture. "As it is, destructive prairie fires consume the grass that cattle should have eaten the previous summer. An example of which we now have before us, of last week's great fires." You who have been reading the papers are familiar with the destruction of ranch property all over that section of the country last week where it is estimated that over $400,000 of property has been destroyed among the homesteaders and the ranchmen. This gentleman claims that this is due to that un- Bpied land growing up in grass and affording a good opportunity for e to get started and become uncontrollable, where, if they had had privilege of eating this grass off last summer, why it would have d that condition of fire. We have one now from Grant county I outs of the 21st at hand, and noted. I don't think that over 20 per of the original entrymen under the Kinkaid act will make proof, a great many of those who make proof will sell, as their holdings not prove profitable under existing conditions. Farming in the sand - proper has never been a success up to the present time. Stock ig has. when the holdings were large enough to give incentive and r profit. You can't get brains to work long when there is no profit, brawn will give it up after a while. "I believe the remaining sandhills could be leased by the government so it would be satisfactory to settlers and would produce a great amount of beef for the people. The eatlle industry has not been progressing for several years in western Nebraska and is still on the decline. Even high prices seem to produce no inducement in this country; the unset - tled conditions are wearing out our best cattlemen, and the people are incessantly cutting down the herds. Settle the grazing conditions In some manner, condemn lands unfit for farming don't let the people file on it. and you will do them a great kindness and make useful citizens of them in some other sphere. This country spells failure and hardship to almost all who come here Kinkaiding." Now, that was an expression of a Grant county man. Here is one from Deuel county: "Answering your first question, as to the prospect of success among Kinkaid homesteaders, speaking only of those residing in this section, will say that owing to the difference of conditions that exists In my im - mediate neighborhood, it is diflicult at this early stage to answer your question with any degree of accuracy. The Homestead claims under the Kinkaid law in this county number from 400 to 500. they range from very good to very poor. There is the claim with good hard soil, and the one of pure sand. The character and ability of the settler varies as much as does the soil. "If conditions continue for three years longer as good and favorable as they have for the last five ye;i per cent of present hold- </seg>
            <seg id="p306">El acquire title. The other 20 per cent will abandon or relinquish r parties. Ten years will see but very few of the present settlers lying with their homesteads. The good land will be farmed and ims only suited by nature will be converted into cattle ranges. "The value of the claims for grazing purposes will Justify at least 90 per cent of the present holders in making final proof. I believe that 75 per cent of present holders are prosperous, that is, doing as well or better here than they could elsewhere. Their condition ranges from well-to-do to mighty poor living. Work is plentiful here. If one is willing, he can And remunerative employment "As to the last question, the best way of disposing of the balance of the government lands, the lands have been picked over and taken during almost six years, nothing but the poorest grazing lands remain. It con - sists of isolated sections or fractions thereof. Allow a reasonable date for future filings, at the expiration of said time sell or lease all remain - ing tracts to adjoining holders, or at auction. Over all of this part of the state are men who have invested all their means and spent the best part of their lives building up the live stock business, but under present conditions we are often unable to use even our deeded land to advan- You will observe the varied condition that exists in the various locali - ties. Now, that does not necessarily imply that what I read here from Deuel county is a prevailing thing throughout Deuel county, because those conditions, those neighborhood conditions, or township conditions, are just as wide apart almost as the county conditions are represented here. It is a spotted country. Of course, down through Deuel county there is more hard soil there than there is up in Grant and Cherry coun - ties, and some other of those other, — it wouldn't do to say they are strict - ly sandhill countries now since Mr. Morrissey has told you what the great value of that country is up in there, and he is right. I have been over a good deal of Cherry county. Well, here is another one from Grant: "I think not more than 10 per cent will be able to make final proof, mostly on account of the improvement clause," (that improvement clause you all understand is an improvement that amounts to $800; $800 of im - provements must be on the'640-acre Kinkaid homestead when the ap - plicant, — when the occupant makes application for final proof, he has got to prove that he has put $800 of improvements on there. And that is a pretty difficult proposition on this Kinkaid homestead matter; some - thing that is too severe I think), "and not being able to raise any great amount of forage. I think the ones who filed first have a better chance, as they had a chance to get the best land. As to being able to establish a farming or live stock industry I don't think they will have much suc - cess as the past winter demonstrated the poor quality of the bunch grass and other sand grasses as hay. The settlers that are coming now have little chance to make a success. There has grown up a considerable business in selling homestead relinquishments, some coming out and not </seg>
            <seg id="p307">even unloading their goods, some claims having changed hands as high as five times. I think if anything is done with the land it would be beat to sell it, as that would settle it for all time." Now, here is one I want to read. It is a little longer than the others but it presents more argument. This is from Cherry county: "I will not undertake to discuss the subject generally, but that part with which I am the more familiar, viz., the sandhills of this part of our Esre remains in Cherry county alone close to 700,000 acres of gov - it lands unclaimed or unoccupied with shadow of private title. n spite of the fact that these lands have been surveyed, a land located at Valentine since 1883 for accommodation of homeseek - id since June 28, 1904, a special inducement offered of a whole ser - ! 640 acres of land under the Kinkaid Act. "This land has been passed upon and over: first, by the searcher of a homestead of 160 acres; and, again, by the man who wanted 'much for his money' when the Kinkaider' sallied forth for his 640 acres. Yet. after all this time, with realty prices advancing and people in a wild scramble for land, especially homes, there remains in one county in Ne - braska 700.000 acres of 'no man's land.' I part of this has been filed upon by some optimistic would-be settler, fter giving it an actual trial in an effort to make it produce him an indifferent living, through hard toil and patience, he has moved e land reverted to the government, likely to be reentered by some hopeful with like experience, the land invariably reverting to our 'Uncle Sam.' Is it not time this government quit taking $14 at a reselling this land? 'The filing of this land.' That is, of course, nail part of this 700,000 acres that people seem still willing to take nee at. "When the Kinkaid (640 acre) law went into effect, there were some - thing over 2,000.000 acres of land in Cherry county, which could be claimed under the same. In filing under the Kinkaid Act each original entry-man of 160 acres under the old law was permitted to enlarge his holding to 640 acres from government lands adjoining his original ICO acres, or elsewhere if land adjoining was not to be had. In many In - stances also one or more children became of age. and each availed him - self of the chance of securing a section of land, which, In almost every Instance adjoined that of the parent's, thus enlarging the area of the original property for live stock purposes. These offerings, together with that of the 640 acres to new, original entry-men have been available for nearly six years, the government waiving the conditions that the land must be plowed and cultivated to crops, and exacting only that he eat, sleep, and place $800 in improvements there during five years' occupancy. Yet there remains nearly 700,000 acres or 1,090 640-acre homesteads in Cherry county alone to take one's choice from. The situation has as - sumed about this shape: The government bets the entryman 640 acres against $14, the price of the original entry, he can not live on the land </seg>
            <seg id="p308">■*ars, and the government is more often the winner. That fact of should be sufficient reason why the remaining lands will not be &gt;riated under the homestead laws, even the Kinkaid law. "Since it should be apparent to every one by this time that the land can not be disposed of to actual settlers for homes as contemplated under several homestead acts, the question is. What disposition should be made of It? My idea is. first, that the general government, through the Na - tional Forest Service, select all that it can possibly utilize in growing trees or for other useful experiments or demonstrations. Jack pines are grown successfully, and other varieties, no doubt, can be made to grow under proper study and care. After the several tracts had been selected for these purposes, a commission might be appointed to visit and appraise the lands and apportion them between the several stockmen and farmers owning and occupying the lands contiguous. This would keep out specu - lators who would buy the lands for no other purpose than to force the stockmen and actual settlers to pay an unreasonable price for their grai - ing privileges. It would allow the stockmen to readjust their fences and own them jointly. It would cheapen the cost of keeping cattle and sheep, alike to the large and small stockmen: would materially increase the number of live stock grown and marketed, and tend, at least, to the low - ering of the cost of meat products to the consumer. It would be more economical for the stockmen for that reason that he would not be obliged to employ additional help in men and horses to herd his stock on the open range, which he is not allowed now to fence, although he occupies it to some extent without paying the government anything. The land, less any which might be appropriated for conservation purposes, would be - come taxable for state, county, and, better than both, for local school district purposes. It is hard to support schools, no matter how far sep - arated in the sandhills, by reason of the large bodies of untaxable gov - ernment lands. Most of the newcomers into the country, who entered under the Kinkaid Act, while they did so in good faith, and many will stay the full time of five years to acquire title, are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. It is, therefore, my opinion that while they have lived on their lands in good faith and are in every way entitled to patents for the same from the Government, having received their patents, it will not be long thereafter before a number of these tracts will pus to neighboring stockmen, from the fact that their 640 acres will not sup - port enough live stock to make them a living, is too light to farm to ce - real crops, and they will not be able to secure any addition to their 640 acres, unless some such method of appraising and apportioning the re - maining lands as I suggest shall be adopted, when of course, they will come in for their share of the increased area. I causing the lands to be appraised and sold. I believe a small pay - of. say. one-tenth should be made in cash, the remaining to be paid e annual payments, deferred payments bearing 6 per cent Interest, oting, the comnjission should allot as nearly as might be* found cable, in the same ratio as land is held by the contiguous owners. </seg>
            <seg id="p309">As a Nebraskan, I, of course, would like to know that the proceeds would enter the general school fund of the state, but the land belonging to the general government to be disposed of by Congress, we should be satisfied could our delegation secure a part of these proceeds for the state. The land pays nothing now, but in grazing, the stockmen use it without con - sideration. They are dissatisfied, however, because there is always a question as to who should occupy it, and I believe the time has arrived when the question should be settled and titles passed to some one. There is no need of further efforts in deluding Congress, the prospective home - steader, or ourselves into thinking they can be disposed of in furnishing homes for actual settlers." Now, gentlemen. I thank you for listening to this, but It is material that comes first hand, and is much better than anything I could say in connection with it. (Applause.) Chairman Morrissey: Professor Hunt will now give you a little talk. The professor will talk upon any subject he sees fit, and he is fit to talk upon any subject. Professor E. W. Hunt: I want to say this about this northwest propo - sition. I am going to say a little I have gathered from my own personal experience. A man can not know that country without being there, and if a man Is there it depends on what his Interests are what he Is coins to say about that country. Now, the men who are interested in cattle up through that northwest country are frowning down any attempt to turn It to agricultural purposes. And this northwest country besides is stripped of all the natural facilities for transportation. My food friend Charley Cornell is trying to cabbage the north, but here is this section without any railroad facilities at all. If a railroad would come across that country you would find that agriculture would develop right in the sandhills. I know men there who are draining the wet ground; always a problem to get rid of the excess water. A problem to get rid of the excess water, and they have the richest soil in the state of Ne - braska. It is too far from the railroad at present to make agriculture profitable; but if they could have railroad transportation facilities through the heart of the sandhills you would find that the sandhills would pay In purely agricultural products. Now, he has given me just five minutes. I am going to show you just what faith I have got in that north - west country. I do not know so much about the geological formation to the south of the river; but if you take the formation reaching from the north side of the Platte north to the Bad Lands; north of the Niobrara river east to Keya Paha county, 1 will demonstrate my "absurdity" by saying that I believe, as much as I believe that the sun will rise tomor - row morning, that under proper handling that country will develop into one of the most productive agricultural areas in the state of Nebraska. (Applause.) And it is nonsense to say it is good for nothing except cattle. You can grow crops there; and this last summer, on the very crest of the ridge of the table was produced winter wheat that went forty bush - els to the acre. And while I am a farmer in Otoe county, I am free to say </seg>
            <seg id="p310">that at this minute, and for all minutes and all times, I will take mj chances of a small grain crop on the high table of Northwestern Ne - braska sooner than 1 will ta*e them in Otoe county today. (Applause.) Now. It is time to talk agricultural production for that northwest country. What it needs is settlers and actual farmers, and the country will not be long developing; and it is time to see something in it besides cattle. The cattlemen see their doom written, cutting their holdings in two in the middle, and if you will only give these Kinkaiders railroad transpor - tation so they can get their products to market the Kinkaid homestead problem in nine-tenths of the sandhills will be solved. The trouble is they have no way to get out with their products at the present I want to see the time come when that whole country will be giving to the world at large its share of the agricultural products, and it can be done. I have seen grain growing throughout the whole of that district, and I know. Summer tillage that we talk about is practically impracticable for any - thing but winter wheat, but we raise oats, we have raised potatoes. Over here in the sandhills south of Hay Springs there lives a rancher who was last summer preaching that a farmer in that country was a fool to raise potatoes and small grain. What he should raise was alfalfa and hogs and turn his hogs through the corn, — raise corn and run the hogs through. And he marketed last fall more than two carloads of hogs that weighed on an average 435 pounds. That looks like something a little better than cattle. 1 want you people of Nebraska to become acquainted with that country and its capacity. It has got to be handled differently from the way you handle land in Missouri or Illinois. It hae got to be handled in the way that is adapted to develop Its resources; but If it la properly handled there is no question whatever of Its agricultural future. They have had 17 Inches of rainfall in Box Butte county for the last twenty years, and 75 per cent of that has uniformly fallen during the growing season; and that is enough to mature any crop If it it properly taken care of. So there is a chance for dry farming as well as for Irrigation in the various valleys; and I hope that some good friends of Nebraska and of the Northwest will bring the possibilities of their country before the state in such a way that it can be made to de - velop as It is really worth developing. (Applause.) A Member: Amen. 7:30 P.M., March 29, 1910 Dr. Condra: We have with us tonight a man who is Interested In the development of the state, and he practices what he preaches and he preaches a good deal, too. The trouble of it is he does not have time to preach all he should. We wish we had more such men as Mr. Coupland. Mr. Coupland will preside tonight. Mr. Coupland: Gentlemen of the Congress: I am certainly delighted to be able to be with you tonight and to take part in this discussion as regards the soils of our state; and I was very much struck with what our late president, who is visiting the Old World, said the other day, that no man Is entitled to preach unless he practices. Now I feel that perhaps </seg>
            <seg id="p311">ri\VA-tir&lt;l l.iui «\ fjDnASKA S 1 A I fci SUAKL) \JF AUK1 LLLTLKb 311 there is more truth in that than most of us see on the surface of it; but I believe we have with us tonight men who will speak to us who, through years, have practical what they will say to us. And I am quite confident that before this meeting closes we shall have had some very valuable lessons given to us. It is about thirty years since I was first permitted to take a handful of this wonderful Nebraska soil into my hands. (Dr. Condra hands speaker receptacle containing some soil.) I was born in a county in the Old World that boasted of its rich soil and of the splendid crops that they could raise, but I remember about thirty years ago when I was flrst priv - ileged to take up in my hand a handful of this remarkable loamy soil (pointing to map), and I said to myself, "This is the richest soil I ever saw." I have lived here on that old farm for thirty years, and I make this statement tonight, the thing that I said then is true, and I believe that we have today in this wonderful area here that is marked by the yellow (indicating on map) one of the richest soils that we have on the face of this globe; so it is right that we should gather here tonight to see what we can do to keep Intact the fertility that a Gracious Providence has given into our hands. Now, there are a great many things that I would like to speak about to you in relation to this soil; in relation to th» ability that it has; in relation to the power it has to sustain plant ■ and the power that it has laid up within its bosom to sustain plant* for many, many, many generations to come, but we have a great many man who will speak, and I do not want to monopolize the time, so I just jotted down In a hurried way just a few thoughts which will take just a few minutes, and perhaps suggest some things which I hope may be of value I know that those who will follow me will have many things to aay to you that will be of value, and I hope that I too may be privileged to leave a thought with you that will at least send you home feeling that you pos - sess a heritage that any man ought to be proud to possess and be privi - leged to live upon. These meetings we are now holding to consider some phases of con - servation of the vital forces of the land and the people who live upon It, and especially as they are more particularly related to Nebraska, I believe will mark an epoch in our state's development; for certainly they betoken an awakening, and I think I am justified in saying a realization, in part at least, of the Immense importance that a proper understanding of the natural forces a Gracious Providence nas placed at our disposal, means, and that there is an imperative demand, perhaps has never existed be - fore, that we become careful and intelligent custodians of the wonderful machinery the Creator has given into our hands to run and to manage. And also — and I want to put marked emphasis upon this thought — and also that if we do our duty, which the very fact of our existence upon this planet presumes we should do, we ought to seek to become efficient operators in this wonderful workshop we of necessity are compelled to toll in. To be users and not abusers of the things which have been pro - vided for the physical requirements of the earth's inhabitants should be </seg>
            <seg id="p312">our highest aim: because out of such a spirit of cooperation will come the best results to the race, and in doing this a further fact becomes apparent, that one of the greatest joys that life can bring is the joy that comes from the harmonious fitting of the human effort into that of the supreme effort. The program before us tonignt is a long one, and you will be privileged to listen to men who have given much thought and attention to the soil and its management, which is basic to all agricultural prosperity, i gentlemen doubtless will furnish us with many facts showing past v. fulness and suggest different methods tor future fanning, all of which I am certain will be most valuable. The president of this congress has asked me to speak a few words on the subject of conservation and crop rotation, and they must of necessny be few because there are so many upon the program tonight. The one outstanding feature in all commercial and manufacturing life, especially during the past twenty-five years, has been the elimination of waste, — the physicist, the chemist, the engineer, the machinist have had their services requisitioned to minimize as much as possible the destruct - ive processes and to seek to retain all that could be retained and can be retained for the use of man. Wonderful things have been accomplished in this great land of ours In this regard in the way of retaining and mak - ing valuable that which used to be cast away and thought to be of little or no account. The latter day quest has been the recovery of as much as possible out of the breakage that lakes place when man seeks to con - struct; and the effort along this line is a continued one. I sometimes wonder how It is and how it comes tnat those who got, and have and are getting from nature at first hand her gifts of soil and things that grow upon It and have grown upon it, should have been here so prodigal and wasteful, and I take this right home to myself; and I am oftentimes ap - palled when I think of the waste that has taken place upon my own farm during past years, and especially as one investigates and experiments as to those things which will make more productive the land and more vigorous and responsive and pliable the animals and the plants that grow upon It; for certainly if there Is one outstanding feature that we learn as we dabble with Nature, with natural things, it is the pliability of these things that grow upon the soil to the Intelligent touch of man,— the re - sponsiveness of the plant, the responsiveness of the animal. Why, as I stood in the show ring there at Chicago at the International this year and saw that wonderful array of shorthorns as tney paraded into the ring and thought that only thirty generations ago the Collins Brothers were just commencing their experiments with the T-side (?) animals there and the Durham, and that in this short space of time of the rounding out by the intelligent cooperation of human effort. There you see the wonderful conformation of body in those lovely animals. Oh, it is wonderful the responsiveness of Nature to the intelligent touch of man. We have no repelling influence when we touch Nature. If I go to the corn plant and want to increase its ability to do certain things, to enlarge its capacity </seg>
            <seg id="p313">will help mankind more, does it shrink from me? No, it reaches out a glad hand and it will give to BM manifold for the effort that I want to put forth to assist it to a larger usefulness; so I know of nothing tha' we ran take up that will give us greater pleasure or means more to this great ftate of ours, and not merely to our own state, but as an example to other states, when we take the soil and the things that live upon it ;in&lt;l seek to use them to the very best advantage that we can. The more M think along these lines the more we regret the past and feel much to the future of our state, for exploitation of land can not continue indefinitely without resistance upon the part of the soil; and I think that is a splendid provision of Natur 1 . She resists selfishness and indolence and repays many fold generosity and intelligent effort. The adaptability of a large area in Nebraska to a system of cropping which will largely keep intact certain elements which are present in the soil, and which are very necessary to a vigorous plant growth; and also the peculiar combination of mineral elements which renders congenial en - vironment to the minute organic life whose functions are to make avail able certain articles of diet which plants require, and also those won - derful and ingenious nitrogen fixers and transformers who find in this remarkable loess soil everything provided in abundance wa.ch will stim - ulate and encourage their activities. The soils of this region require a wide system of cropping which will not merely conserve their ability, but which will enrich and enlarge that ability, — for all this wonderful valley of agricultural lands, reaching here from the northeast corner of the state, swinging clear around here (indicating on map) nearly to the southwest corner of the state, a soil not merely a surface one, but for many, many feet In depth permeated with plants, stimulating minerals; a soil which largely encourages plants to dig deep down into its lower levels alter the moisture and food it has stored up for them. Certainly there never was a land which afforded greater opportunity to the skilled and diligent agriculturist than this wonderful Nebraska of ours. Wash the faces of your hillsides away, and you still have a soil which is richer in mineral matter and potential fertility than before, and which will af - ford to your clovers and your alfalfa and the little organisms which love to cling to their rootlets a veritable paradise to grow and revel in, and these organisms in a short while will supply an abundance of the mate - rials that your cereals and other crops require. As I have traversed these fertile plains and undulating hills in Nebraska many, many times have I thought and said. "What a wonderful and goodly land it surely is!' and as one notices here and there evidences of mac's selfishness, ignorance and lack of intelligent cooperation, one is impressed with the importance of such a gathering as this, and the absolute necessity of changing the methods into those of the thrifty conservator of Nature's Kand a generous Nature has made it so easy to keep intact the abil - our soil, and, in fact, to enlarge that ability by a series of crop - which will not yield us less during the time we are busy carrying on. and will give greater recompense for our immediate effort, and ) future stores of food for succeeding crops. </seg>
            <seg id="p314">The multiplication of clover and alfalfa fields in Nebraska and a sys - tem of tillage which will render it congenial to the micro-organisms which exist and live in the soil is all we need to make more abundant our crops of cereals. Tne growing of these legumes will make more kindly the soils touched. And I want to just refer to a visit 1 made to my good friend William Ernst's farm last year. As we went over those fertile fields of his, with the wheat reaching up to our chin, just as prolific in growth as it possibly could be. we reached down and took hold of the soil and it was kind and nice to the touch. We went over the fence to his neighbor's field, where the wheat barely reached to our knees. The soil was harsh and repellent, all because the man who had tilled it had lacked the intelligence and diligence to do the wise thing. The growing of these legumes will make more kindly the soils touched; and I like to think of that tramp, — the kindness of the soil, and more generous its re - sponse to our efforts. It will enable it to more efficaciously hold the rains which fall upon it, so that in times of need it can slake the thirst of the plants it is its mission and joy to support. Those countries which have made the greatest advance in crop production per acre, and who stand at the head today in that respect have one-third of their agri - cultural lands down to grasses and clovers. Their natural conditions of soil and climate, as we have heard today, are not nearly so favorable as ours, yet they beat us two to one. However, I am very sanguine about our future agriculture in Nebraska; and I am sure this congress Is only just the beginning of larger things ere long, and not very long, either, our state will take the place she, by a generous Providence, Is destined to occupy. For, If In unison, wuh our splendid heritage of soil, the In - telligent, diligent conservator Is seeking to do his part, immediate recom - pense will be large; and, better than all beside, our capital stock of the greatest natural asset we have will be kept intact. (Applause.) PROFESSOR A. A. TYLER, BELLEVUE COLLEGE, BELLEVUE, NEBRASKA. ■*s before the First Nebraska Conservation and 8tate Development Congress held at Lincoln, Nebraska, March 29 and 30, 1910. K President and Gentlemen: In his proclamation calling for the ng of this Congress, Governor Shallenberger, under the caption i Care of Tlmoer," says, "Our timber resources should be cultivated mproveil and added to each year under a proper system of intelli - forestry." It is for tnis phase of the great conservation problem wish to ask your attention. The general government and many of our sister states have well under way consistent plans of scientific forestry in the timbered regions of our country. Our own state of Nebraska unfortunately has but a scanty sup - ply of natural timber. But so much the more does it become us to con - serve and handle intelligently what we have, and to show ourselves not </seg>
            <seg id="p315">one whit behind others in our appreciation of the importance of this prob - lem nor in our ability to make the best of the situation. We have the pines of the northwestern counties and the deciduous forest scattered in spots along the Missouri and lower Platte rivers, now mostly cleared. In each of these regions tracts should be secured and set aside by the state as forest reserves upon which the principles of scientific forestry may be practically illustrated for the education of our people in the car - rying out of similar plans on their own lands and for their profit in the timber produced. Some site, probably near Crawford, would be advan - tageous in the northwest. In the eastern part of the state, by far the largest and most varied tract of timber land lies along the Missouri river in Sarpy county, between Omaha and Bellevue. This piece of land of some 2,000 acres in extent possesses a rich soil of forest loam and has tempted gardeners to clear small patches here and there, but it is a wild, rough country of narrow ridges separated by deep ravines leading to the river, entirely unsuited for cultivation. But Nature has shown her appreciation of Its best use in covering the tract with a growth of timber and to this use it should be left. The tract produces naturally 15 or 20 species of trees, including three kinds of oak, red and white elm, maple, boxelder, basswood, buttonwood, cottonwood, willow, black walnut, two ashes, mulberry, hackberry and two or three hickories, showing by this variety its adaptability to species that might be introduced and which might prove more valuable than some of native growth. The people of Nebraska owe It to our own and to succeeding generations to preserve this fine tract of timber for p.ll time at on* of the moat Important of our natural resources. It is now being rapidly destroyed by the ax, fire, and the plow only to have the steep slopes rap - idly denuded of their soil, and the time is not far distant when our fellow men will point to our lolly in allowing this ruthless waste of the bounty of nature. Bl main portion of the tract should be put Into operation as a prac - forest, managed according to scientific principles for profit, but as e suggested, it has a large educational value as well. Its use In iction with the giving of systematic Instruction In forestry at the State University, In the colleges, and other schools of the state is self - evident. Its educational influence upon owners of lands where timber may be grown I have alluded to. But it would have a wider influence stin upon the general public visiting the tract. It would be in effect a great state park with its driveways and woodland paths, a place where recreation of the most elevating sort might be sought. The native birds of which so large a number make this tract their home would here find perpetual domicile under protection, always accessible in their going and coming, and in their nesting time to lovers of bird life. Here also might be located a branch of the state fish hatchery drawing water supply from the fine springs of whiih several occur. The most extensive remains of the ancient dwellings of aboriginal man are found on this tract Those would also be protected, and interested visitors would be shown the evl- </seg>
            <seg id="p316">dences of the former activities of these forgotten tinman beings. Many rare plants that hide in the secluded nooks of this forest would no longer n daily danger of extermination. Farther than this, the mo6t able portion should be set aside for an arboretum where should be grown one or more specimens of every tree, shrub, and woody vine suited to the climatic and other conditions of the tract, all properly labeled and so made doubly interesting to the lumberman, the student, the scientist, and the amateur botanist. By spi'cial arrangement with Bellevne College it would also be possible to secure the use of an additional MQ acres of land more suited to the purpose than any within tn ■ limits of the reservation for a botanical gar - den where should be grown and labeled every species of flowering plant known to this region of the world, with glass houses for those of warm climates, and a museum for collections illustrating all the plant world, its flowers, fruits, grains, fodder, and forage plants, medicinal plants and their products, textile fabrics and the plants producing the materials for their manufacture, various woods and finished products, everything veg - etable or horticultural, agricultural or commercial interest, and impor - tance The communities of the whole country are vielng with one an - other for the establishment of such institutions. Few If any have op - portunity to combine successfully so many features in one great institu - tion su?h as this would be. and its location near the point of convergence of all the great highways of the state makes It easily accessible to vis - itors from all quarters. Ehe scheme Is eminently a practical one. When fuiiy established, the &gt;me from the forest will probably provide all running expenses and give to the state a self-sustaining institution of the greatest possible le to It for generations to come. I would have the state secure possession of this tract by exercise of its right of eminent domain and charter a board of trustees to whom its management should be entrusted, to be constituted somewhat as follows: The Governor of the state, the Chancellor of the State University, the president of Bellevue College, the full professors giving Instruction in the departments of botany, zoology, geology and archeology in the Uni - versity of Nebraska, Bellevue College and Creighton University, one member appointed by the Nebraska Academy of Sciences, one by the State Ornithological Society, one by the State Historical Society, the board as so constituted to have power to elect a limited number of other persons who are deemed specially qualified for such office. These steps once taken, the day is saved. An opportunity about to slip from us and our children's children seized to be held forever. Then development can go on as fast as circumstances permit. Gentlemen, this is the opportunity, not of a lifetime merely, but of centuries to come. I&gt;et the people of this great state as represented in the coming session of the legislature rise to it, meet it and give to posterity a gift that will bring the gratitude of countless generations to tnose who in this day made such wise provision for the future.

            <seg id="p317">CROP ROTATION. An Address Delivered Before the First Nebraska Conservation and De - velopment Congress, March 29, 1910. ('. W. PUGSL£Y OF NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION There is no greater problem in the conservation of natural resources than the one of conservation of soil productivity. Nebraska is. and always will be, largely an agricultural state. Where wealth depends upon the richness as well as upon the productions of fields we can not hat wealth consists of what one has in hand. We should rather consider that wealth consists of what one has in hand plus what one has in store. Nebraska has considered herself rich because her crops have been large and prices good. It is time that she stopped to con - sider what the next century will bring forth, — if the general practice of Nebraska farmers is continued for that length of time. The basis of our present and future pio^perity is in the producing powers of our soils. We are comparatively a new state. Tht re are very few pieces of land in the state of Nebraska that have been farmed for more than half a century. The majority of Nebraska farmers have been exploiting the land. They have found it responsive to the tickling of the plow, and from the doors of their homes they have been able to see broad acres ready to yield bountifully to a minimum of labor. They have been anxious to reap the harvest which seemed waiting for them, and have given little thought to what the future migi.t have in store. It has only been a few years ago that those of us who are young can remember Nebraska farmers saying that the soils will never give out. It is the same sad story that has been repeated in every new land. Wh.-n the Pilgrim fathers landed on the eastern coast, they consi.! the vast stretch of fertile soil inexhaustible. When the decreasing crops and the thickening population caused them to move over the AHeghanles. they there found a land rich in producing powers, and failed to take warn - ing from the experience in trie East. Finally these began to diminish and they came on to the great plains of the West. Here were millions of acres of rich land. The wells which were dug and the ravines washed out showed the soils to be of comparative richness to great depth. They found the lands fertile, and concluded that they would always remain fertile; that no matter what crops were grown or how these were handled, there would be no decrease in the inexhaustible supply of plant food, and consequently no decrease in crops. Ki sequel to this story is reading tne same as do those of the eastern he central states. Within the last few months there hare been in Bee a good many men who have dropped in to talk over conditions, one, "Years ago I got 60 bushels of corn per acre and now I get 20. letter farming now than then. What is the trouble?" Kher will say, "Formerly my soil yielded 75 bushels and now I well if I get 30. How can I increase my yield?" </seg>
            <seg id="p318">Eill another owner adds, "When a young man I bought land at $25 acre, and I raised easily 50 bushels of corn. Now my land will sell 175 an acre, and I can only get 25 bushels." I here is the saddest one of all. An intelligent young man says — a father came to this state he homesteaded. His improvements i.m about $5 per acre. He raised 60 bushels of corn, 30 bushels of , and 40 bushels of oats. I have an equivalent of $100 per acre ed in land — the same land — and raise, with an expenditure of labor than my father ever deemed advisable, 30 bushels of corn. 15 Is of wheat, and 20 bushels of oats. What am I to do?" If these results have been brought about in a comparatively short time what will the story be of the boys and girls of the future? But we are to change our methods. There are some things we already know which will help matters very much if the farmers can be induced to fol - low. Hundreds of farmers in the state of Nebraska are now awakening to the necessity of changing their systems — not because of their own wel - fare so much as for the sake of their children and their children's children. I has said that there are three steps in the march of progress, first is the agreement of the ignorant. The second is the ilisagree - t of the inquiring. The third is the agreement of the wise. We hav&gt;&gt; ed through the first. We are now in the second, as evidenced by gathering. We may never realize the third in its entirety, but are nning to realize some of the benefits of such an ideal condition in w scattered instances. It we don't know about the proper method of handling the soil relation to various crops grown is very much greater than what know. There are some things, however, which have been well I out, and which, if followed, will at least delay the date of im - shed land a good many years. By that time we hope to have many questions solved, and postpone the date indefinitely. I of the things which has proven of profit beyond the question of I is rotation. We hear a great deal about this. We read of it in •icultural papers. We hear it taught from the institute platform, rmers speak about it on the street corners, and the preachers pular lecturers speak of it in a vague sort of a way. It seems to of the straws in the midst of the ocean, and at present is one of *t promising. We do not know all about crop rotation yet, but know that under most circumstances crop rotation is advisable. I ore I start a detailed discussion of this I might Jefine what is meant •rop rotation. If we grow corn continuously on the same ground after year, we do not have crop rotation. If we grow corn one year «ts the next, then corn, then oats, then corn, then oats, we have a m of crops repeating itself every second year, or a two. year ro - l. If we grow corn, oats and wheat, then corn, oats and wheat i, we have a three year rotation. The same is true with any combi - n of crope we might select. If our ground is changed from one crop </seg>
            <seg id="p319">to another and then comes back to the starting point again, we have what Is generally tennfd a rotation. Many farmers in the state of Nebraska have been pra&lt; t ring some tort of a rotation. For instance, I was advocating to a [armor the other day that his salvation depended somewhat upon the kind of rotation he adopted. He threw up his hands in amazement and said that he had always practiced a rotation. I asked him what this was, and he said he had grown three or four crops of corn and followed this with stu&amp;li grain for a year or two, then three or four more crops of corn. He had been practicing this for thirty years, bad added no manure to the land, had used no fertilizers, had never seeded it down. It is true that he wu practicing a crop rotation, but he was not practicing the crop rotation that I was trying to recommend to him. He was practically in the same position as the man who had practiced continuously cropping with corn 15 years, then with wheat li years as the man with the two coats which he wore alternately was to the man with the two toats. one of which he wore until it was past service, then donned the other. Both would wear out. The chances are the man who changed his coat each week would have a coat to wear a trifle longer than the man who wore one coat continuously until it was beyond repair,, for the good wife would get hold of it occasionally and put in a few needed .Hitches the same as good nature gets hold of a piece of ground seeded to wheat between crop and corn crop and makes a few repairs. These repairs, however, are not very lasting if the rotation is like the one described. Kre we discuss the important points of rotations in particular, let ak of work that has been done with rotations in general. These &gt; summarized briefly as follows: A few years ago the land in Rhode Island was in a very bad cond; Many fields were reported which would not produce corn over six inches high, because of continuous cropping. One three-year rotation in which some sort of a leguminous crop was used gave a loss during the first three-year period of $6.79 per acre on land described above. During the second three year period there was a net gain of (23.54 to the acre. On a four year rotation the expenditure for the first four years was greater than the income, with the second four years there was a return showing a net profit In Missouri rotations have been carried on at the Station for fifteen years and in every instance larger yields and larger net gains for • period of years have been produced on the land which has been in rotation. Likewise Indiana has records for fifteen years on plats at the Experiment Station. The fertility of the land is improved and all crops produced larger yields where land was rotated than where it was cropped continuously. There was an average gain in corn of 22 per cent, oats 26 per cent, and wheat 44 per cent, over the land which was worn out by continuous cropping. Louisiana now consld &gt;rs the growing of legumes in rotation an absolute necessity. </seg>
            <seg id="p320">North Dakota found that three years of wheat and one of clover give practically as much wheat and greater not returns than four meca crops of wheat. In G..10 it was found that rotations give better results with fertilizers than fertilizers would give without the rotation. In fact, they make the statement that fertilizers without rotations are not profitable. With P continuous cropping of wht-at (d no fertilizers the yield wa »d the yield was 8.41 bushels; tous of manure was added pei from 1894 to ISM on plats which re - 10.8 bushels; for the next four-year and for the next 118 bushels. Wh&lt; re acre per annum the yields were 15.77 bushels for the first period, 18.48 for the second and pra; tically th&lt; same for the third. Continuous cropping on other plats without manure gave a yield at the end of a 15 year period of ln.43 bushels. The yield at the beginning was 25.25 bushels. With a five year rotation without manure the yield was 31.04 bushels. Continuous cropping with manure gave a yield of 34.62 bushels. A five-year rotation with manure gave a yield of 59.75 bushels. In Minnesota twelve years of continuous cropping with wheat reduced the nitrogen content of the soil 2u..j pounds per acre. Only 450 pounds of this was removed by the wheat crop. This left 16nn pounds loss to bt accounted for in some other way. The Minnesota Station contributed this to the loss of organic matter in the soil. A dressing of manure every five years and a rotation ot corn, wheat, oats and clover saved m thousand pounds of nitrogen to the soil, and there wa« nearly twl much nitrogen removed by the crops. Still there was ;i slight k nitrogen in the five-year rotation in which clover occupied a place. Where clover was grown every four years, however. I a gain of &amp; gain of organic mat'er which the station conclml runs lu.i with the content of nitrogen. In the four-year rotation tlii lined 5 bushels over the continuous cropping and the corn 20 bushels the continuous cropping. Another interesting f( the Mini: investigation was the fact that the subsoil co oae-thlrd nitrogen where the rotation was practiced than did the subsoil on the plat where continuous crop* were grown Illinois has probably done as much work in crop rotation for long periods as any station in the Unit They have reported r on their oldest plats for SI years and on their newer plats for 1"&gt; K continuously for 31 years now yields 27 bushels per acre. The yield '0 bushels at the start. On the plats which have been in for 15 , corn grown continuously gave a yield of 36 bushels. The yield »bout 70 bushels at the beginning. The corn on the plat which Eitated with corn and oats without any application of manure gave hels on the 31 year plats and ob on the 15 year plat. With a ro - of corn. oats, and clover, the yield was 58 bushels on the 31 year on the 15 year. With corn, oats, clover, and manure the yield was hels for the tl v«ar and SI for the 13 year, this being an increase &lt; mnds of nitrogen in the twelve years. Tn </seg>
            <seg id="p321">I am sorry to say that we have no results to report from the Nebraska Exper.ment Station. No definite rotation plats have ever been estab - lished. Tnis is prjbably due to t.,e things which seemed more important Nebraska has been busy working on variety tests, the proper method of tilling the soil, and importing and producing varieties of grain suitable to our climate. It Is impossible for all things to be done, especially with a limited amount of money. We expect, however, this spring to establish several series of permanent rotations, and we hope that we will be able to keep these running for many years to come. Results of this kind are only valuable after they have been running for a long period. I must say also that we hope to do considerable work of a cooperative nature with the farmers in the state. Very often farmers come Into the office and ask advice about the proper use of fertilizers, and crop rotations on their farms. In the absence of experimental data we advise them the best we can in the light of what has been done at other stations and in the light of what has been determined by our observa - tions and cooperation with farmers. My office secured during the last year reports from 31 Nebraska fanners. It was the object of these re - ports to determine what effect, especially what immediate effect, the use of clover or alfalfa had on subsequent production of corn. The average of 31 reports is as follows: 34.5 bushels were yielded on land before It was seeded down to clover and alfalfa, and 68.2. or practically twice as much, was grown after it was plowed up. This being an average of so large a number of careful Nebraska farmers the results indicate In a degree the great value of legumes. Of course, we must remember that these results are not for a very long period, the longest one reported be - ing six years. The majority of them are for one or two year periods. We are also endeavoring to cooperate with farmers who wish to test the effect of fertilizers on some of their low yielding soils. As I did not take charge of the department until last June, I had very littlt opportunity to get tuese tests started last year. The station farm is not suitable for testing the effect of fertilizers on poor land, for all the land has been kept in the best possible shape. For this reason co - operative experiments are for the present most desirable. Only a few of these can be undertaken now because of the lack of funds. One re - port from Dannebrog in Howard county, gives the results as follows: On the plat where no treatment was given, which was the same as the adjoining field, the yield was 14.13 bushels of corn per acre. Where phos - phorus was added the yield was 15.15 bushels. Where nitrogen was added the yield was 17 bushels. Where phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium were added the yield was 18 bushels. Where barnyard manure was added the yield was 31.5 bushels. We have reports of a similar nature, but not cooperative, which have been received from various farmers in the state. All seem to indicate that the yield is Increased more by the proper application of barnyard manure than by the application of fertilizers. This is especially true if the barnyard manure is applied in conjunction with a rotation of crops, which includes a leguminous 11 </seg>

This is the moat important reason why Nebraska farmers should establish rotations. The organic matter in the soil will be increased.

To summarize let us say. that Nebraska is extremely fortunate. That it appears from work done by the Experiment Station chemist and from observations of results over the state, that the subsoils of eastern Ne - braska are as rich as the surface soils, except in nitrogen and humus. The nitrogen and humus content c: n be maintained or even increased by the growing of leguminous plants in a proper system of rotation and by proper application of barnyard manure. The long-cultivated fields appear as rich in potassium, phosphorus, and lime as the virgin soils. It is an essential thing that the Nebraska farmer adopt some rotation containing clover, or alfalfa, and in which the application of barnyard manure is an important factor. Just what this rotation will be depends largely upon the conditions of the farm and the type of farming being done. A grain farmer would not adopt the same sort of a rotation as the hay farmer, the stock farmer, or the dairy farmer. In fact, these rotations do not need to be worked out in a complicated or elaborate manner. The farmer should bear in mind, however, that best results will be obtained if not more than two or three crops of one grain are grown in succession, and if not more than four or five years elapse be - tween the use of the leguminous crops, and that the manure should be applied directly to the corn crop or as top dressing to the meadows and pastures; that these manures should be properly applied, which means that they should be evenly spread thoroughly incorporated with SOME CONSERVATION PROBLEMS. BY S. C. BASSETT. GIBBON, NEB. Realizing the importance of conserving the resources of the state, and more especially our agricultural resources, this meeting has been called to consider this question with the ultimate object of creating a strong, healthy public sentiment in favor of such conservation, such a public sentiment as is useful, helpful, and beneficial only when the individuals who make up the so-called public, believe and practice such conservation. I have in mind to present some of the things relating to the problem of attempting to create this healthy public sentiment desired, for in my judgment it does not now exist in the state, and that it will be a difficult matter to create and build it up to the extent needed and desired. A friend of mine, who accumulated plenty of this world's goods, once related to me that as a fatherless boy he was hired out to work on a farm in one of the New England states, and that in the fall of the year the farmer and his wife seriously debated whether they should winter twelve or thirteen hens. There is not a farmer in this state but what will smile at the thought that any farmer should give much thought </seg>
            <seg id="p325">as to whether the number of hens wintered should be in number a few more or less; a very large per cent of NeDraska farmers do not give serious thought to whether the number of cattle or horses wintered should be In number a few more or lees. Why should it much matter? There is more or less of rough lorage going to waste, anyway. Nebraska fanners would think that a family living upon and owning a farm whoee productive capacity was such as to make it necessary to consider and take into account such trivial expenses as the one mentioned, that such a family must be very poor indeed, must lack for means to procure necessary food, clothing, or to educate their children. It was largely the sons and daughters raised on these farms, and who were taught, believed, and practiced conservation of resources, and as more important than all else, the conservation of soil fertility, who came out to the West, into the state of Nebraska to found farm homes of their ■ On their arrival, "Uncle Sam' of a family a warranty il&gt; ••&lt;! u own.

For tin se two periods we find that while the average yield per acre in Mad decreased eight bushels, or 22.X per cent, that the average farm value of the crop per acie had increased $2.95 or 34.6 per cent For the same periods we find the average yield per acre of wheat has 7.^ bushels or tin per cent, and the average farm value per acre ;;creased flO.U or 12tl per cent. Also, we find that the gray-haired Mather and the white-headed grandmother who still own one of uilt farms or who purchased one at from three dollars per acre to ten dollars or fifteen dollars per acre, suddenly find themselves styled "plutocrats," or "land barons," and are beset on every hand to put a price, for sale, on their farm at from $75 to $150 per acre, meaning trom flj.uiiii to $l'4.iiihi for a quarter-section faim.

It is far more difficult to have their descendants really believe there is very much of importance in them and practice them. One of the many untiring, unselfish workers in this state, to whom as a people we owe a debt, not only of gratitude, but a much larger com - pensation in yearly salary, is our good friend Dr. Condra. He lately published for use in our public schools a small text-book entitled "An Agricultural Geography of Nebraska," and when a copy came into my hands I read it from cover to cover with as much Interest, and far more profit, than ever I read a dime novel in years gone by. A copy of this book is not at hand as I write this paper, but I have rather an indistinct impression that in explaining the formation of soils in this . their depth and fertility, it is stated that in the loess region these soils sometimes reached a depth of 100 feet, and that in the western part of the state the soil deposit sometimes reached a depth of one thousand feet. For the purposes of this paper the exact depth of the soil is not material as it can be learned from unquestioned authority, from Dr. Condra himself. On my homestead farm in Buffalo county it is sixteen feet to quicksand, where we find water, and every foot of the sixteen feet is soil — fertile soil. In the early days we dug many wells on this farm, a score or more. I had a neighbor who would dig one of these wells in two or three hours, and so we dug wells all over the farm for convenience in watering stock, whether kept on a picket rope, as at first, or in pasture, later; I recall that in digging a well where the prairie sod had not been disturbed, we sometimes found roots of </seg>

The on is. "Krom the knowledge you have of the purpose of this con - what, in your opinion, are the most important features, at this demanding ihe auction of the people of the state?" In the order ming importance the answer is: First, a rotation of crops extending over not less than three rears; (a) because it will in largest measure, under present conditions, help to solve the question, conservation of soil fertility; (b) it will lessen the risk of loss from crop failure, all the "eggs not being in one basket"; i lessens the risk of &gt;oss from insects which increase more rapidly where a large acreage is devoted to one particular crop or where the same crop is raised for a term of years on the same field; (d) it extends the labors of the farm over a longer season which tends to economize In crop production. Second, better and more timely methods in farm operations. To illustrate, the winter wheat crop of Buffalo county had an approximate value of 1V4 million dollars in 1909. The acreage for 1909 was increased over 1908, and present price prospects warrant a total increased value of the crop for the year 1910. Present indications are that the crop is damaged to the extent of from 30 to 50 per cent which, if it is finally proven to be the case, will lessen the value of the crop some $600,000, or about seven dollars per acre. Inquiry and Investigation show that not all fields in a locality are damaged to the same extent, also that the damage is less on fields plowed early, thoroughly harrowed and made firm and seeded early, while on fields plowed late in the season, and on which neither time nor labor were spared to barrow and make firm the </seg>
            <seg id="p329">soil, the damage is much greater than on like fields plowed early. Again. Buffalo county harvested approximately 100,000 tons of alfalfa in ISO*. There has been a steady demand for such bay at prices ranging from six to twelve dollars per ton, the larger price being for hay cut at a nr»wr - able time and cured and cared for so as to retain all the leaves as well as the natural color of the plant. "Third, more care in the selection of seed grain, and above all, in the case of the corn crop, which in acreage exceeds that of all other grain crops combined, the use of seed which not only has strong vitality, but by reason of being raised for a long term of years in a locality has become acclimated and is much more certain to fully mature and produce a crop. I am fully persuaded that the decrease in average yield per acre of our corn is 8 bushels, or 22.8 per cent, as between the periods 1876 - 1885 and 1906-1909, has not been brought about by a corresponding de - crease in the soil fertility of our farms, but in part because of a large use of seed corn raised at altitudes ranging from 400 feet to 1,400 feet lower than that of farms in the corn belt of Nebraska, raised in localities having a longer growing season of from fifteen to thirty days than does the average Nebraska farm and in localities having a larger average rainfall than does our state. In the effort to promote corn improvement there has been too much stress laid on size of the ear. straightness of rows, filling of tips and butts, and too little on adaptability, acclimated to the locality. Some of those who have traveled over the state advocat - ing corn improvement have carried as sample ears those raised under much more favorable conditions for growing ears approaching perfection according to arbitrarily established rules of perfection, than exist in the larger portion of our state, with the result that too many of our farmers have been seduced into buying seed thus raised, with the result that the average yield per acre has been reduced, when under more practical and more wise methods of improvement the average yield would have been increased, thus better rewarding the labor of the farmer and benefiting the state at large."

"Horse-breeding" generally hu received little attention from oar "departments of agriculture" and really our Experiment Stations might </seg>
            <seg id="p330">do our farmers a great service by devoting more attention to horse - breeding interests. Horses have been Mgtoctad in experimental work and little free literature for distribution published. Our state has done none this year. We have been left to find out for ourselves. I hardly know where the "tare of the colt" should begin. I really be - lieve at the time you purchase your brood mare. However, I will confine my time to the date you receive him from his mother (of course you will be there) in a clean, roomy, weli-ventilated box stall. ■, you must be on hand. Don't take any chances of losing him by carelessly allowing the dam to remain tied in a stall among the farm geldings and mules and you find the youngster standing among this crowd of strangers, or trampled to death beneath their feet. Nor allow the dam to remain in the fields or lots at this critical time among the other stock where she is likely to lose the youngster by not being able to properly care for it. Etake It for granted you have carefully fed this dam. Not over-fed ut allowed her a reasonable amount of clean clover or alfalfa hay, r few oats and a little brun. (A bran mash with a little oil meal will be of benefit to her now unless she has been on grass.) From ime on, a great care must be exercised in feeding the mother, as ust regulate the flow of milk and the bowels of the colt by the food ive the dam. You examine the mare soon after "foaling" and find little or no milk. It will be a good plan to rub or knead the udder four or five times a day with the hand, and sometimes it is well to rub a little castor-oil on the udder. Avoid giving her too much water or roughness the first few days. Leave her alone now for a few hours, free from any surround - ings that might annoy or excite her, then if the sun is shining and the stall seems damp and chilly, get the mother and colt into the sunshine, sense in this, don't turn him out in a burning July sun, nor turn mother and colt out with u band of horses where the mules and colts each in turn give It a chase, but lead her out on the lawn, or turn her tn a small paddock for a few hours each day. If for any reason the mare refuses to give any milk, you must take some cow's milk (with a little sugar added) and feed the colt until such a time that the mare will teed it. But I have said little about the "care of the colt" and I imagine some one is saying "I knew all about what has been said." The very first thing you do when you receive the colt is to examine the "navel string " and if it has broken off close to the belly of the colt, you call a veterinarian (in fact, if you are not real certain that everything is all right with both mother and colt have one of these fellows come at once anyway). If the "umbilical cord" is all right you tie a piece of "waxed-end" or string tightly around it about one inch from the colt's belly and leave it to rot off. It is said that the largest per tent (10 per cent) of foals that die are lost with "navel trouble. ' You can avoid this loss, or lessen it at least, by observing above and bathing the parts with a solution of carbolic acid, and seeing that no manure is left in the stall, but instead plenty of good dry straw. </seg>
            <seg id="p331">Er colt is doing nicely now, and we depend on the mother to care :, and in fact it' left to nature she would, bin we are caring for her and must avoid sudden changes in iced anil .surroundings, but pro - plenty of feed and exercise. The question now arises, "Shall we work uare?" And I, taking for granted that we will work her moderately, i say "yes." Don't hitch her up until the colt is nine or ten days beave the colt in the barn or in a small paddock in connection with tall where it can't see its mother. Never let the colt follow the while she is working in the field. Avoid turning the young colt the pasture where it can see its mother where it will tret and run igh fences and injure itself. Take time, to let the colt suck once in the forenoon and once in the afternoon. Should the mare get too warm at any time while working, milk her out carefully before letting the colt to her. Eiink it a good plan to turn mare and colt out into corrals and fenced while the colt is young, so that the youngster becomes accustomed e fences. This field should be properly fenced though, either i wire, hedge, or smooth wire, and all wires should be tightly drawn, some kind of shelter provided; some timber is helpful but better part of barn or a good dry open shed. Provide a rack with i clean clover or alfalfa hay in it. Provide a feed box where the colt can eat with Its mother, which it will begin doing at six weeks or even sooner. At three months old give the colt a separate feed box and allow it to eat all it will of the following: Vi r-ushed oats and % bran, or % crushed oats mixed with ground alfalfa. (Add a little corn.) Wean the colt at from six to seven months, continu - ing tne feed. The matter of "feed," quantity and composition of, is one that dif - ferent persons will not agree on. We. as feeders and farmers, are prone to feed the grain we have most of on the farm, seldom selling one kind of grain and buying another feed. And the rule has been— we feed corn to everything. Corn and alfalfa can be fed to older horses with good results, but nothing has been found to equal oats as a horse food, especial - ly the young horse. Therefore. I would recommend the ration mentioned Colts are apt to get "wormy." However, good authority tells us to feed plenty of alfalfa and we will never be bothered with worms in our colts or older horses. Keep in mind, friends, that it is not the work the mare does that injures or "stunts" the colt, but that it is the "ex - cessive work," and not supplying the worked mare with enough nutri - tious food. A majority of our colts are "stunted " more or less during some period of their lives, often by the prevailing idea that a colt to make a "hardy horse" must learn to "rough it," and our way too often is to let him roam the fields with an empty stomach and with nothing but a few dry corn stalks to suck at. and no shelter but a wire fence. This Is all wrong. Let him have the run of the fields, strawstacks. </seg>
            <seg id="p332">E -stacks too, if you please, and by all means see that he gets his ration of grain. From yearling up, half corn and half oats la ration. Continue above treatment until he is three years old, then &gt; work him. Don't work the two-year old. "I said, "break the three-year old," but don't break his heart the first season. Work him with moderation. In conclusion let me say: It is difficult to say some things that will not be misconstrued. Understand me right A colt does not need to be kept under "hot-house" conditions. It will thrive better in the open, except during stormy period*, but bear in mind our fields, as a rule, are bare; our state is inclined to be a little "windy", though we are not as windy as we used to be; our snow apt to blow a little; we sometimes have sudden atmospheric changes; and when a writer tells us to raise our colts outdoors, conditions he refers to may be different than with as. His pastures may be luxuriant blue grass in "sheltered wood land." We here must provide this extra shelter and feed, tor without ihese you can't produce a big, strong, well-developed horse. THE MOST PROFITABLE TYPE OF SHORTHORN BY J. G. BRENIZER, BROKEN BOW, NKB This is a pretty hard subject you have assigned me. One that 1 can not answer, but if I was to start out to find an answer, — to learn something along this line, I should go down to the South Omaha Stock-Yards, and you would find me there both early and late, watching the feeder buyer buying the feeder steer.

Then if I should be able to go back again on the following Monday morning, I would not yet feel justified in my own mind to call myself even a novice at this task. If I could watch this fellow, the feeder buyer, and the feeder steer selected by him, for a few years, I might become a novice along this line. But one thing I have learned, and learned quickly, by watching this wizard. Is that If I myself wanted a bunch of feeders, I would not give niteen cents a dosen for his leftovers, after he was through with the bunch. Would you? Right here allow me to digress a little. Supposing you and I are look - ing for a herd bull; could we afford to say: "Well, I can only afford to pay $200 or $300. and after the high priced or beat ones are sold, and prices get down around my pile, I will buy one." Do not too many of us do this very thing? Can we afford to buy leftover herd bulls, any more than we could afford to follow the shrewd feeder steer buyer, and take his leftovers as a gift? Well, what do we find this shrewd feeder iteer buyer doing? The first impression is that he knows what he Is doing, — is onto hit Job. It la evident that he has a fixed type in hit mind. You would find him working like a ball-bearing machine to that type. He it after the feeder type. Those words cover about everything </seg>
            <seg id="p333">Now, for a moment let us try to apply what we have learned from this practical fellow, — because we are all striving to produce Just what he wants to buy: to type in the Shor t norn — or rather to the Shorthorn bull, and see what we have; we have a wonderful animal. I might say a machine; the most wonderful and perfect machine ever seen by man. But it has required generations upon generations, almost centuries of work of some of the best brains of the world to produce this model of the feeder type. Is he the 'most profitable type of Shorthorn?" Let us set this wonderful machine in action, and see what his produce will be. Results are what we are after. And. my friends, if this model I hare set up before you will not produce results with the accuracy almost of the needle gun, then I am dreaming. The better the cow you breed him to. the better will the produce be. But he will stamp ninety per cent if not more, of everything you breed to him with his own intense type. No power on earth can resist the wonderful prepotency of this moat wonderful machine. He can do only the one thing by all the laws of nature, i.e. produce his like. Look at this calf; short leg, wide and broad all over. He seems to have been born with all this wealth of thick natural flesh on every par - ticular point, where my friend, the feeder buyer wants it. He was literally made that way; and he grows it from the start, — flesh and meat. He may also put on some fat, but he does it right. His business in life seems to be to grow flesh, and if given half a chance he will do it, and you can rarely make him do anything else; and why? For generations his an - cestors on one side at least, — and usually on both sides — have been bred and fed into natural flesh carriers, and this fellow cannot help it; that is a part of the machine, and like all modern machines, yon must kill it to stop it. He has inherited these tendencies from his intensely bred sire, and is himself a living example of a feeder's type of Shorthorn. Is he the most profitable type of Shorthorn? WHY WE SHOULD BREED ABERDEEN ANGUS CATTLE BY T. A. GIERENS, LINCOLN. Ii breed Aberdeen Angus cattle in the corn belt in Nebraska? Why any cattle in Nebraska? This question we American farmers must r and answer at once. Not ten years hence, but now. Already ve been selling the best of our soil with every load of wheat we to market. Already we have so impoverished our rich lands so roduce only 25 bushels of corn where they should produce 60. We that in 30 years of poor soil management, we have impoverished •h lands more than England and Germany have in 300 years. Yes, friends, we have gotten to the point where we will have to put hack something on to these once fertile lands, and how shall we do it? By breeding more live stock. By breeding more cattle and in order to make the business profitable, by breeding better cattle. By breeding Aberdeen Angus cattle. </seg>
            <seg id="p334">Al most of you are from Nebraska it ought not be difficult for me to oa wby we should breed Aberdeen Angus cattle. If you will with mo. I wish to call your attention to another reason why we .1 breed cattle in the corn belt. Not only breed, but feed them, not ■•are to come, but beginning at once. Already our supply of feeder from the immense ranches of the West of "us have been reduced until we can't hope to get anything from that territory after another year or so. Some say the West will furnish us feeders for 10 years, but the conservative tells us three. With the "wiping out, if you please, of these enormous cattle ranches, not temporarily, but permanently, where is the meat supply of our land to come from? With a constantly increasing population and all nations of the earth dumping their teeming thousands into our laps, is it any wonder our ng th.nkers are alarmed at the advanced cost of living? Is It any wonder. I say. that they are alarmed as to where this great supply, at any cost, is to come from? I tell you. gentlemen, J. J. Hill knows what he is talking about when he says "go back to the farms." when he says: "Keep the boys on the farm." Yes, friends, we. the farmers In this territory, must prepare to supply the food, the meat for this immense people, by breeding cattle, by breeding the best we can. We, as farmers, breed the live stock, or should at least, that responds with the greatest amount of profit for feed consumed. There is no doubt whatever but that the Aberdeen Angus steer produces more meat, and better meat, than any other breed of cattle. I shall not stop and try to prove this. It has been proven repeatedly, in our feed lots, in our International shows, and the Angus cattle have won more prizes than all other beef breeds combined. This has been true when shown as pure breds and also when shown as grades. I experience and observation has been that we not only get better from an Angus sire but we get more of them. Who ever saw a Angus calf excepting where slaughtered for veal? The young i calf has the energy of a mule. Again, the Angus mother is the motherly of all cattle breeds. I have seen as many as eight old 'ondling one little waif within an hour of bis advent into this strange Did you ever see any other breed of cattle exercise such motherly instinct? No. Another reason the Aberdeen cattle are the most profitable and why we should breed them is because whether pure bred or half blood. they are uniform. Uniform in size, uniform in conformation, uniform in color, shape, feed evenly, need no dehorning, can be more easily handled, and outsell an even bunch of cattle on any market in •rid. -. they cross well on any other breed of cattle, and I really believe the day is here when every "dairy cow" in our country (whose calves </seg>
            <seg id="p335">335 are not reared for dairy purposes) bulls, and instead of destroying this as is being done all over our land, th months old and sold as "baby beef, hould be bred to pure bred Angus alf at from two days to two weeks, calf should be fed until he is fifteen weighing from 800 to 1,100 pounds. Would this not be better than destroying the raw material? Of course it would. Oh. I tell you. friends, this generation must change Its system of wastefulm Our farm lands are advancing in price. They continue to advance. We can"t afford to teed this high-priced feed to inferior live stock. We must breed the very best of all stock whether it be hogs, horses, or cattle. When I was a boy we counted on feeding a steer to a four-year old and his eating 100 bushels of corn. Not so now-a-days. We must breed a critter that will cievelop into 1006 to linn pounds ol choice meat at fourteen to sixteen months. Can you do this with a scrub? No, but you can with an Aberdeen Angus if you will properly feed and care for him. No other breed of cattle in the world is so well fitted for "baby beef" as the Aberdeen Angus, and who ever heard of any breed- feeder of cattle losing money feeding cattle? All of you have, but who ever lost a dollar feeding -baby beef?" making "baby beef out of thrifty Aberdeen Angus calves? Not one of you In the breeding of Aberdeen Angus cattle for profit, we must adopt some plan and follow this out. It may not be out of place for me to sug- gest a way I have practiced a number of years, and with profit. My herd of cows consisted of "pure breds" and "grades." I used pure bred sires. My young calves came on in March and April and sucked the cows till October when they were taken off the cows and put into a small. well-sheltered lot where they remained until sold the following summer. The first few days these calves ate very little. They made a noise. We had placed a number of low feed boxes here and there in the lot and began these calves on a mixed ration of oats %, ground corn and cob meal %. with alfalfa hay. This was continued till January first. when the grain ration was gradually changed to shelled corn with a little pea sized oil meal These calves never lost the "calf fat." They continued to grow, to take on meat, and the question that comes to you perhaps is, "When did you sell them Calves treated this way should be kept right in this dry lot until September, though you can turn them with much profit in June or July, and sometimes with most profit. I have fed calves of other breeds, but not with much success. They continued "growing." They grew slim. They grew tall. They did not seem to take on fat. They did not sell well Gentlemen, there is not a man in Nebraska today (even with the advanced cost of feed) but what can profitably raise and feed Aberdeen Angus cattle to sell, either as stock cattle for the founding of new herds, or for slaughter. Is it true of other cattle? Shall we continue to raise more and better Aberdeen Angus cattle? I leave it with you. I thank you. </seg>
            <seg id="p336">QUALITIES OF ANGUS CATTLE. BY JAY UVKRTY, SOUTH OMAHA, NEB. To ' e permitted to meet with you and to recount some of the good qualities of Angus cattle is not only a privilege but a pleasure. It has been said that lie who makes two blades of grass grow where was only has done a service for mankind. This is true, but how much more rredit is due the men who, through discouragement, opposition, and indifference have brought our herds by careful breeding from the Texas longhorn and mongrel, to the high class beeves that reach our markets today. Yours has been a mighty work — greater because you helped others while helping yourselves. You have taught the farmers and stock growers hraska that it costs less to grow a high-class steer to maturity than a poor one, that they are more docile, more easily managed, and, last and most important of all, they are always in demand and sell at the highest price. These general remarks apply to all breeders of registered cattle alike. There are some points, however, in which the Angus breed excels all others. Points more apparent to the man who sells and kills them than even to the breeder, for we meet the objector face to face and he does not hesitate to voice his likes and dislikes freely to us. In this connection I wish to call attention to three things to wit: First, their salability as feeders. Second, their salability as beeves. Third, their killing qualities. Iv than ten years ago we handled 1,800 head of Angus steers from I T ranch in Texas. We kept most of them through an unusually winter, demonstrating to our complete satisfaction that they were hardy, sold them in lots from 25 to 100 head all over Nebraska, and Illinois, and when fed out they never failed to top the market lich they went. Khad a customer in eastern Wyoming who for years kept about ead of pure bred Angus and a like number of equally well-bred of another kind. We handled and sold both for years, and the of the same weight, off the same range, and in the same flesh ! the others as feeders from twenty to forty cents. Imy time of the year a lot of pure bred Angus cattle, either steers rers are in stronger demand, and will sell at higher prices than any breed. This not only because of their appearance but the fact that how every pound of feed given them, are ready for the market r, and sell at higher prices. If they sell higher as beeves at the markets, there must be a reason. Let us see what it is. First, they are more attractive Second, they take less feed to "round up." Third, when finished they "kill out" well. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 337 When the Angus steer goes into the feed lot, he is gentle, feeds quietly, and assimilates all the food given him. More than this, they have no sharp corners to cover and 1* its them in marketable condition than any other breed. They also finish well, showing all their fat and respond satisfactorily to good care. There are three classes of buyers for fat cattle: order buyers who ship to other markets, independent buyers who kill for their own trade, and the packers. While every commission house handles all kinds of cattle, the most desirable kinds to sell are those on which there is the most competition. With their sleek coats, their low down blocky frames, and their well rounded bodies, the black "Poddies" always attract atten - tion and every buyer is anxious to get a chance on them. Nor do they disappoint any one who handles them from the breeder to the packing Kictiveness, docility and economy of feeding are all desirable, bat preme test is the "kill" — the percentage of high-priced meat an animal produces.

History reveals to us a continuity of progress, nations rise and fall, new on£s building upon the ruins of the old. each contributing to the ex - cellence of its successor. Such has been the history of the Red Poll cattle, and each record brightens as they increase in age. Two centuries of existence hold no dimmed page. Founded in hope and apprehension, this great breed struck its root deep into the vitals of American agricul - ture, and feeding on its fatness has waxed wondrous great. While we have not ceased to marvel at their great development, yet we are wrapped in an ever-increasing admiration. Each year brightens with a glow of enthusiasm as the breeder leave* the show ring with a greater determination to produce an animal hitherto un-showed by his fellow breeders.

            <seg id="p341">rE E8SENTIALS IN SUCCESSFUL AND PROFITABLE SWINE FEEDING. BY PROFESSOR WILLIAM DIETRICH, University of Illinois There are a few facts of fundamental significance in the field of swine industry as follows: First, swine growers can not produce the fall litter as successfully as they can the litter that Is farrowed in the spring. ■ond, many breeders have repeatedly changed breeds, having tried breed for a number of years, and not succeeding as well as they ht they might, they have adopted some other br. tldering this, in view of the fact that the better one's acquaintance e breed and the longer the herd is bred and handled in one's hands ater should be the success, and in view of the fact that the fall lit - not as successfully grown as the spring litter, it indicates quite that there is something radically wrong or entirely unknown about item of swine breeding and swine feeding as now practiced. The feeding of a hog, or in other words, the making of a hog might be compared to the building of a brick house. If such a house is to be built it requires a certain definite quantity of various materials such as brick, mortar (made of lime, sand, and water), and lumber. Before being able to build such a house the builder must know the kinds of materials it re - quires and the quantity of each kind that is necessary. Likewise, in or - der to be able to produce a hog successfully the feeder must know the constituent parts of a hog, the amount of each constituent, the character of feed necessary for the construction of each constituent part, and also the amount of each nutrient or constituent part of the feed that can be handled by the pig to the best advantage for the proper construction of each individual part of the hog. The hog is made up in general of mineral matter, which is found mout largely in the bones; of protein, which is found in the lean meat or n. and also to some extent in the bones; of fat, as illustrated by the fatty tissue of the carcass and the fat cells distributed throughout the lean meat or muscle; and the water, which is found in all of the tissues, espe - cially in the softer tissues. In round numbers about 50 per cent of the live weight of the hog is water. Something can not be made out of nothing. Furthermore, the animal body can not substitute indefinitely. While carbohydrate can be used to some extent in place of fat, and fat in limited quantities in place of carbohydrate, the animal body can not make mineral matter out of any - thing else, and neither can it make protein out of carbohydrate, fat, or mineral matter, and water also must be supplied and it can not be made out of dry matter.

Furthermore, different sections of the same country and different count ries contain different mineral mat - ters of various kinds; and again, as there is no standard for the mineral requirement of swine, there are no set rules according to which mineral matter should be fed. In order, therefore, to supply this part of the metabolism, mineral substances such as common salt, bone meal, or ground phosphate rock, air-slacked lime, wood ashes and charcoal, should be kept before the hogs in separate troughs so that they can have free access to it at all times. They will then be able to supply their mineral metabolism according to the dictates of iheir appetite. In order to furnish the hog the means with which to build up his mus - cle or lean meat tissue he must be given the required amount of protein in his feed. Protein metabolism can not be supplied with any other nu - trient. Protein feeds that are available to ihe swine feeder for this pur - pose are clover and alfalfa, which are roughages and can not be used exclusively as a source of protein except lor mature hogs. The concen - trated nitrogenous feeds are such as skim milk, soy beans, cow peas or Canada field peas, oil meal, tankage, ate The last two, however, are commercial feeds and should not be used except when absolutely neces - sary. As for instance, when they can be bought more cheaply than the others can be produced or when the home .supply is exhausted. I -eat deal of work has been done by the writer at the Illinois Ex - nt Station to determine the amount of protein necessary for a max - and most economical production. This is thoroughly outlined and led in station publications of the Illinois Agricultural Experiment i, and also in a book by the writer on "Swine Breeding, Feeding, anagement." which is being published by the "Breeders' Gazette" cago. 11 necessary to feed the required amount of protein, and it is just as •tant not to feed too much as it is not to feed too little. It is a very matter to overfeed a pig on protein so that he will never grow as neither make gains as profitable ;is he would if this had not oc - i. Again, it is a comparative alter to feed a pig so much in that he will become permanently stunted, and if he is fed a little he may actually be killed.

The writer, however, has recently determined that it is just as important for maximum development to feed the right quantity of water and that this should be varied during the life of the growing pig. It has been shown that the pig at two months of age requires 12 pounds of water, daily, per 100 pounds live weight, and that this should gradually be reduced to 4 pounds when the pig is eight months old and in prime condition ready for market. It has also been shown that if the pig is given either dry feed or thick slop and free access to water he will drink too much during the summer and will not drink enough during the winter. Neither condition will be conducive to greatest or most economical gains; consequently it is neces - sary for most successful swine feeding to feed the right quantity of water pigs are compelled to gather them, and while tki ml at let the same time masticating them it is a pretty good opportunity for tribution. especially if the pigs In the drove are mot too numerous and are of the same size and age. If these beans or peM can lie fed to'v with the vine the possibility of better distribution will be still greater. Carbohydrates, such as is found most abundantly in corn, among the common farm feeds is used by the animal body far the production &lt;■ ergy, heat, and fat. and must be supplied to the pig in proper quair daily, per 100 pounds live weight, the same as the protein, in order to get best results. The quantity of this is also discussed in the above men- rmed publication. The life of the market hog for mu ag should lie di- vided into two periods, the growing period and the fattening period. </seg>

An animal can live for weeks without dry feed, can live for days with - out water, and can live only for a few minutes without air, consequently the oxygen obtained from the air is of the greatest importance as a sup - ply of food. In order to obtain sufficient oxygen to properly metabolize and use the feed that is taken into the stomach, such as corn, milk, soy beans, clover, etc., which furnish the various nutrients like carbohydrate, protein, and mineral matter it is necessary that the pig's respiratory ap - paratus be properly developed and properly used. In order to use this properly it is necessary to give the pigs sufficient exercise because exer - cise is conducive to respiration. In order to develop this part of the pig properly it is necessary that he should be bred right and led right for at least five generations before he is born. In order, then, to feed a hog properly it is not only necessary to supply him sufficient mineral matter, sufficient protein, sufficient car - bohydrate, and enough water to go with these, but it is also necessary to see that he gets an abundance of oxygen to properly use up what he takes into his stomach and which is digested and goes into the circulation, com - ing into the lungs and meeting the oxygen that comes into the lungs by means of the nose. One of the main reasons for the lack of success with the fall pig is that during the winter season not enough water is taken for proper develop - ment Another reason perhaps may be that a great many times not enough protein is supplied. A third important factor is the oxygen fac - tor, which is determined by means of exercise. Aside from these three principal considerations there are other minor considerations such as protection from cold, furnishing a dry place to sleep, freedom from cold draughts, plenty of sunlight, etc. ■i of the main reasons for the continual change of breeds is the fact eeding is improperly done so that herds run down, where if they properly fed they might gradually be built up and improved. Pi it can be readily seen that success in swine breeding, as well as ne feeding, depends primarily upon supplying the pigs with a quantity of the various digestible nutrients such as protein, car - ■ate. ether extract, mineral matter, water and oxygen, and further - that pigs are fed right during a long series of generations. </seg>

BY JOHN OCONNELL, MALCOLM, NEB Having recently found that I was on a program (or an address before this meeting, and the subject allotted is "Breeding, Feeding, and Selec - tion of Hogs for Breeding Purposes." ■the time to prepare a paper is so short, and the subject so long. I nly take up part of the subject The part I will take will be '•Select - ogs for Breeding Purposes." My leading thoughts will be along the lines of only the Poland China In my attempt to point out a few illustrations of the past, I am able to speak only of the breed that I am somewhat familiar with. I have made a specialty of the Poland Chinas for the past thirty-two years. The names and numbers of animals I shall use will be that of the Poland Chinas. I would like to be familiar with other breeds also. But at any rate, to show how a leading breed of animals may be established and maintained by the laws of selection and breeding, allow me to go back over the rec - ord of such animals some forty or fifty years. The length of time will take us back to the old white spotted Poland China that was raised in the hog belt, and perhaps more in Ohio than any other state. I find in the records: Bob Harkrider, No. 20. Farrowed in spring of 1861. Color: White, with a few small black spots. Bred by John Harkrider, Franklin, Ohio. Dan, No. 9. Farrowed in spring of 1868. Color: dark spotted and sandy mixture. Medium size. Bred by Henry Stotenburge, Franklin, Ohio. Old Harkrider Sow, No. 11. Color: white, second choice out of 22 pigs. Bred by John Harkrider, Franklin, Ohio. Queen of Four, No. 67 Farrowed in spring of 1868. Color: spotted. Very growthy. Bred by F. L. Boyde, Springboro, Ohio. Gate Lifter, No. 35. Farrowed in 1864. Color: white. A few small black spots. An excel - lent breeder. Bred by L. D. Doty, Mlddletown, Ohio. Warner Sow, No. 60. Farrowed In spring of 1868. Color: white, one or two small black spots, of great sise and length. Bred by Charles Warner, Monroe, Ohio. Young Bess, No. 171. Farrowed In spring of 1876. Color: black, slick coat Bom* white on </seg>
            <seg id="p346">BGood even form. Very large. Runs to old Harkrider Sow II ly J. H. Bugh, Franklin, Ohio. Tom Corwin id. No Farrowed in April, 1878. Color: very nice coat of black hair. Some white on legs. Fine mold and broad back. A great prize winner. It had only been about twelve or fourteen years from the day of the old white and spotted hogs until the date of farrow of Tom Corwin 2d, Young Bess 172, Cora Shallenberger. Sisson's u.ack Bess, and other great show and breeding hogs. Hence, you will notice that in the hands of those great early day breeders, the Poland Chinas made a great improvement in a short time, and it was made under ihe law of "selection and breeding." Now allow me to quote from a paper the National Fine Stock Association know who prepared the paper but of Oxford, Ohio. read about thirty years ago before assembled at Chicago. I do not think it was Professor Bonham Ssays. "The records of weights made in a packing establishment it clear that it pays to raise pure bred swine for pork. The of Wrend &amp; Shaffer, of .Middletown, Ohio, show that they packed 0 a lot of Pure Bred Poland Chinas, thirty-eight head, nearly all m black, and of a very smooth even type, fattened all by one man Franklin, Ohio, averaging t!3o pounds gross weight, at the age nty-one months." K shows again the improvement made in a few years of the great of Poland Chinas in Warren county, Ohio, where they were fed rket as well as for breeding purpo E&gt;m 1870 to 1880 the Poland China made a good steady improvement, during that time they were shown at all the leading fairs in the •A States, and many of the fairs in the Old Country too. And there t great demand for them at good prices, to be used to improve the ion hog, and they were shipped all over the country for that purpose. From 1880 to 1890 this breed of swine became known in every bog-rais - ing country in the world, and there was a good healthy demand for them at all the packing centers, as well as for breeding purposes. It in the breeding business of Poland Chinas, up to this time, would use the very best of the breed tor breeders, and would travel eds of miles to make a selection, perhaps of only one pig, to be in their herds. Hence, you see the law of selection and breeding a practice and the hogs were getting better every year. K judging of all swine at all fairs was done by the system of "three ' up to about 188$ or 1890. Aboul that time there was talk of a way of judging swine, and breeders of different parts of the y held meetings for the purposes of establishing a better prac - judging swine at fairs. Briers called for a National Association Meeting, held in some place lana, I think, and at that meeting, after a lot of wrangling, there committee appointed to draft a score card, and after a lot more </seg>
            <seg id="p347">of wrangling they adopted a score of points to be judged by sections, and to be used in the hands of a single expert judge. Up to this, and at this time, the Poland Chinas became famous and have been winning the "lion's share" of all sweepstakes at all leading fairs, over all breeds. And they were more in demand for breeders than ever before. At this time they were a hog of great size, great quality, ami style, color most all black, with white points, extra good feet and legs, with the best of action, and, of course, were the most popular hog of the day. But about this time trouble commenced. As there was a great demand for Poland China pigs for breeders by the farmer and pork producers, new men came into the business for selfish purposes, and, with the prac - tice of the single judge with the score-card in full force, the breed lost size year after year, and it came to a stage that the little roly poly, fat, short quality pig, no good for breeding purposes at all, would win the prize over the larger, more useful pig. This made some of the old breed - ers look wise. And most of all the good herds of Poland hogs that at - tended the fairs most every year, and selected the breed for winners under the score card practice, in a short time found their hogs lost the great useful size that they maintained from the very starting of the breed up to that present time. And with the trouble with the score card came the sale boomers and the hog jockey and trader. Only a few of them were what you could call breeders. Their aim was not to build up the breed. They were in the business for a selfish purpose — to make all the money they could and in a few years get out of the business. Hence, there never was a breed of swine abused as the Poland China was by this lot of grafters. The trickster and the trader The long price persuader. The boomer so clever But a straw note giver. A hot blood singer The roly poly fat pig seller Only a nine months' breeder In advertising some of the Poland China boom sales some of the parties said in their ad, "In the business only nine months and we have sold $30,000 worth of Poland Chinas in that time. 11 Of course, this boom sale business made lots of excitement, and some of the good old breeders lost their heads and seemed to be in the swim for all there was in it (but most of them soon recovered). Of course, the hogs sold and selected by the boomers were not a good breeding type. If they had individual size they generally came from a small line of blood or from herds of what they call "a score card show herd." Pigs from this small quality breeding did not give satisfaction to the pork producers, hence. But a $30,000,000 receiver. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">many of the farmers condemned the Poland China breed and said they were too small, and also not prolific. Realizing the situation of this breed, the good infallible breeder, who never was in any boom, kept on in the same old lines and carefully and thoroughly made his selections of both sires and dams, and considered size as well as quality in his selections for breeding purposes, and was able at all times to deliver the goods and sent out pigs that many of them made from 800 to 1000 pound hogs, and today we have Poland Chinas with size of the Jumbos and the quality of the little duffer. In regard to selecting hogs for breeding purposes, I would suggest, first, size. And the sows 1 would want to have a good color, short wide heads, jaw not heavy or flabby, neck of medium length, shoulders broad and deep, full around Ihe heart, back quite broad and slightly arched, loin full, not too sloping rump, deep sides and long body, medium size of bone, and limbs of fair length. I like the legs set well apart and quite straight. In the boar I want more size than the sows, and I want all the quality I can get in a large animal. I also want a heavier bone than the sow. Now, as to age, I will not say how old. Every meeting of this kind that it has been my pleasure to attend, for the past thirty years, the farmer has been told through papers and addresses that he must use matured breeding stock for breeders, but he never has done so, or perhaps never will. But in some way or another he has been able to supply the demand lor pork and lard with his gilt herd and pig boar. I know that some of you old breeders think you can't do business unless you have a herd of old boars around you, but allow me to go back to Poland China history. I can show you and you don't have to be from Missouri either, that the best results come from the use of the young boar and many times only a pig. 8tar of the West, No. 55, changed hands lor a iong price many times, and he was sired by a pig less than nine months old, and, in return, before he was nine months old, he sired the great of the breed Tom Corwln 2d, No. 35, and one of the best hogs Tom Corwin ever sired was before he was one year old. Old Give or Take, and the most notable son to the credit of Give or Take, was sired by him when he was only a pig, and that was Lord Corwln 2d. And old breeders say there never was so many good prize winner* sired by any hog, old or young, as there was by Lord Corwln before he was one year old. Tecumseh 673, before he was twenty months old, sired the great TecumseL's Chip 2169. He in turn sired the great Mc's Tecumseh 4430 before he was sixteen months old. Chief Tecumseh 738S, before he was fifteen months old, sired the greatest Poland China hog that ever lived, Chief Tecumseh 2d 9115. Asd Chl«f Tecumseh 2d, before he was twenty months old, sired the great L's Tecumseh. Nodwmjr Lad 4182, before he was sixteen months old, sired the great </seg>
            <seg id="p349">BStop 6938, and he was kept and used for years after that in three r good herds, and he never did so well again. Blaine's Tecumseh a great breeding hog, sired all his best sons before he w»s two years old. El go on in this way enumerating young sires in this breed of t have done so much to build up the breed, for a week, but I nt to stay here that long and pay board, hence, I thank you n for your attention. THE BEST TYPE OF HOG FOR THE FARM BY THOS. P. MILLER, YORK, NEB. This seems to me a pretty big question and one that, under presant conditions, should receive the most careful consideration. Pick up al - most any newspaper or periodical and one sees a discussion of the question, "The high cost of the necessities of life as compared with a few years ago." These increased values enter into all departments of our living ex - penses, but more especially food products of all kinds, and the question of the hour seems to be, "Can these charges be lowered?" All the various products under discussion come originally from the farm. Many are consumed practically as they come from the hand of the producer. The balance reaches the consumer through various channels and in many forms, due to different processes of manufacture. If these products are to be sold to the consumer at a lower charge, and the American farmer is to hold the place rightfully belonging to him. it can only be brought about by lower cost of production. Thus, our farmers are con - fronted with a serious problem and one they will do well to consider most earnestly. In the first place stands the fact that land values have increased In an even greater ratio than farm products. Second, the ordinary help, which is as necessary to him as it is to any manufacturer for the suc - cessful prosecution of his business, has not only advanced greatly in price, but has become almost an impossibility to secure at any price. These two conditions must be reckoned with. They are facts and c*n not be set aside and stand as a serious bar to lower cost of production. To a great extent old methods must give way to newer and better ones. Greater care in the selection of the live stock, and the exercise of better Judgment in the improvement of the same, will enter largely into the plans of the successful farmer of the future. "The scrub must go" will be his motto, and he will bend his energies to obtaining the greatest possible return from each bushel of grain fed. Burst step in this direction will, in most instances, bring the fanner consideration of the subject of this paper, "The Best Type uf Hog e Farm." I say the first step for while the improvement of the cattle, hones, </seg>
            <seg id="p350">and sheep will play an important part in the plan of cheaper production, yet it is to the Great American Hog that the rank and file of our farmers look for help in their financial troubles. In the language of Hon. F. D. Coburn, "He is the latest model of self-lubricating mortgage remover, and can always be depended on to make both ends meet." It is a reasonable supposition that no class of ra^n make the im - provement of our hogs more of a serious study than those engaged in producing pure bred stock. We depend upon the farmer for our support, and if we are to make a permanent success, must produce the class of stock that will best meet his demands. And whil? we, as nreeders. differ to some extent on this question of type, yet 1 think we are more nearly a unit now than we have ever beon. Our own personal opinion is, that the big type Poland China hog is the best type for the farm, for several reasons. First, a farmer with sows and gilts of this type is. with ordinary care, assured of generous litters, good big pigs, and lots of them. Nothing starts a man off so well in the spring as good success at farrowing time, and no one thing will tend to promote this, year after year, so much as go'&gt;d big roomy sows and gilts, mated with a sire of same type. Second, tho big type is best fitted to withstand the almost exclusive corn diet to which our fanners of necessity subject their herds. Corn with green feed in season and they will thrive and do business, and by the careful selection of a sire each year will more nearly maintain the size in ihe h. j rd than either the medium or small types. The tendency of the average hog seems to be to grow finer In bone and smaller in carcass, under ordinary farm conditions, mad it is to guard against this evil, with the resultant loss of vitality which manifests itself in small litters, and make pigs trouble at farrowing time, etc., that we advise the purchase each season of a sire of the strictly bh; typo. Again, we advise this type on account of their feeding qualities. We believe they are the most profitable feeders, and that they will yield the greatest returns per bushel of grain fed, under ordinary farm conditions. They are great rustlers from birth, and when given the run of alfalfa pasture require but a minimum amount of grain to mako heavy growth of bone and frame that will take on flesh easily and rapiilly v.iien placed on feed In the fall, arriving at the 30(1 pound stage with a greater net profit to the feeder than any other type. Especially have we found them the most profitable to follow cattle. They are strong, active, vigorous, ;iud well suited to care for themselves in the yard. In fact, our expeiience, covering a period of over twenty-five years, has taught us that under any and all circumstances they will yield the best net gains. The scales tell the story at the finish and it is thi're that the final test results in victory for the big type. These are our principal reasons for advising the adoption of the strictly big Poland China hog lor the farm. As a brother breeder has very aptly expressed it, we advise them on the same theory thai a $20 </seg>

SHEEP RAISING AND FEEDING IN NEBRASKA BY PETER JANSBN Mr. Chairmen, students of the Agricultural College, ladies, and gf ntlemen: E greatly pleased to meet you lier&lt;&gt; today. I am glad to see so students of our Agricultural College. There is nothing 1 like at better than a lot of nice, clean-cut young men. unless it be ne number of nice, handsome youus? ladies. '. am asked to speak to you on sheep raising and foodiag in Nebraska. ;ir.d. although I am now on the retired lis., shall be glrvl to give you the benefit of my experience gathered during ov«r thirty fivo years of BCttvc work with sheep. In fact, this i.&gt; the first season since I ume to Nebraska in 1874 that I am without sheep, and I miss them. Went out to my brother-in-law's farm the other day simply to see and s-nell them Before starting on my subject, will you bear with me a few minutes while I discuss one or two other matters? In the first place, I want to congratulate you students of our Agricul - tural College upon the great advantages you have in preparing for your life work as farmers, over the boys of thirt&gt; or thirty-five years ago. At that time. Nebraska was one great exporimental farm, and we had to make the experiments at our own cost and risk, and without the advice and guidance of experienced teachers. In fact, when I came here, the few settlers along the creeks and river bottoms said the upland prairie would never be fit for much except grazing. How conditions have changed! Land that then could be bought at from %3 to $5 per acre can not be purchased today for $100. and if you take Lincoln as the center of a square of 300 miles each way, you find 57.600,000 acres of the richest, most productive, and most valuable land, not only of the W«*, but of the globe. This is not fiction, but absolute fact. I the early days the farmers' credit and purchasing power was , and the sheriff often made the sales and the lawyers and bankers the profits. Today the man who owns a Nebraska farm and a good of sheep or a drove of Nebraska porkers stands on an equal footing fially and socially with the banker or lawyer, and beats the store - » all hollow, and they are only too glad to go riding with the farmer s automobile. Eking of automobiles in connection with the Nebraska farmer, a laughable incident not long ago at a sale of thoroughbred hogs, inner had come to the scale in his gasoline wagon and bid off male pig weighing about 100 pounds.

But joking aside, life on the farm is not the drudgery it used to be, and there is no more honorable occupation than that of the up-to-date, progressive farmer and stock raiser, and ncne more remunerative at to - day's prices for all farm products. Therefore, boys, don't leave the farms. A good farmer is of much more benefit than a poor preacher, and that reminds me of a little story I overheard. There had been a protracted religious meeting, and a goodly number had been converted. Among others a husky young farmer got up and said he had been called to preach; three nights in succession had he seen in his dreams a fiery emblem with these large letters "P. C." in the center, which he could not interpret otherwise than to mean, "Preach Christ." The ministers all agreed wilh him and were about to ordain him when one old brother spoke up and ventured the opinion that those letters might imply something else, and when pressed to explain, said they might mean "Plow Corn " Well, boys, there is a good deal of truth in this story. A good many men who are now preaching would be much better off if they were plowing corn. I "to return to our muttons", as the Frenchmen say. The days of ? sheep feeder, as well as the big farms, in Nebraska, are gone, to return. Fifteen or twenty years ago, there were dozens of men state feeding from ten to twenty thousand head of sheep each . The most I ever had under my own personal supervision at one ras 27,500. We used to trail them across the plains from Oregon, New Mexico, and other range countries. Those days the range sheep were almost invariably infested with "■cabbies," and the first Job after they reached the feed lots in Nebraska was to dip them, which meant swimming them through a long, deep vat filled with a hot solution of lime and sulphur at a temperature of about 100 degrees. Thanks to our aggressive and practical Department of Agriculture at Washington, the dread of the sheepmen, scab, has been almost eradicated, and when it appears a decoction of tobacco is used as an effective bath. We used to divide these western wethers into lots of about 500 each, separating them according to ages and condition. Most of them had never eaten corn or grain of any kind, and we had to be very careful in getting them started. We fed from 3 to 6 months, and would make a gain of from 20 to 30 pounds per head. Prairie hay was used for roughage mostly, and we figured 3 to 4 bushels of corn per head, and about 10 sheep to a ton of hay per feeding season. Dry quarters and pure water were the essentials, besides the regular feeding and gentle handling. I always hud sheds for my sheep. I could sleep better myself while a blizzard was raging, and the sheep certainly did. However, these reminisences, while pleasant to the old timer, are not of much value to you at the present time. The feeder of today buys </seg>
            <seg id="p353">lis stock at the big central markets, where they are shipped from the ange in the fall of the year. It is advisable, although not compulsory, o employ a reliable commission firm, one that makes the handling of sheep a specialty. They generally fully earn the ten dollars per double deck which is their charge. They attend to the dipping, if such is necea - sary, as well as the weighing, loading and billing. If you buy lambs, you can generally turn them into your corn fields or awhile, and they will trim up the leaves and weeds in nice shape, &gt;esides leaving a valuable coating of manure. As soon as they begin o eat the corn, they should be taken out and either put in tame grass pasture or into the permanent feed lots. If kept on grass until late, it s advisable to give them a ration of corn once a day, say a half pound per head. Salt should be kept with them or supplied at regular intervals. If placed into the feeding pens, they should be given all the roughage hey will eat up clean twice a day. Alfalfa, which we have now learned o raise so abundantly fn Nebraska, is the very best and most economical lay for sheep and lambs, and when it is fed nothing but corn is needed o make a well-balanced ration. A pound of shelled corn per sheep a day with plenty of alfalfa will fatten them very rapidly. As mentioned before, sheep should be kept dry and be given constant access to pure water. Handle them gently never stare them or yell at them. You may have noticed that all successful sheep men are nice, gentlespoken fellows. LBut why not raise the lambs on your Nebraska farms? This is a ques - &gt;n I have often asked in private and public. The answer, if any, is generally, "I don't know anything about she^p." or. "I am not fixed for them," or, "I don't care to bother with them." If you will only try, you will soon learn all about them, and the fixing for them is a small matter. As far as the bother is concerned, I know they make a good deal less bother than dairy cows or even pigs. At this time most of our well - improved Nebraska farms are fenced hog-tight into fields and pastures, and these will do equally us well for sheep. A low shed covered with straw will afford them the best of shelter. Of course they car. not be \Tell kept in the same lot with hogs. Don't start in on a big scale; get a hundred head of good 'vestern ewes and two or three well-bred Shropshire rams. The whole investment would not be over $500. If you have a warm place, you can have the lambs come early, say in February or March, and by the time pasture is available they will have a good start. Don't feed the ewes much corn. A little corn-meal with oats or bran will start a good flow of milk. Give plenty of good hay. You should raise at least 100 nice lambs, and with good care considerable more. The ewes would shear about seven pounds of wool per head, worth twenty to twenty-flve cents per pound. Keep your lambs growing all summer, and in the fall start them gradually on grain, and about the middle of December you should have a single deck of prime, fat lambs weighing nearly 100 pounds each ready for the Christmas trade. This season they would have brought you about eight </seg>
            <seg id="p354">per pound at the river markets, and you can figure out the profit In the transaction for yourself, not forgetting some fifty loads of the best kind of fertilizer, of which our Nebraska farms are standing very much in need. The old ewes can be bred for several years, weeding out sue h as may not prove good mothers, and substituting in their place ewe lambs of your own raising. Ire is nearly enough rough feed wasted on any good sized Nebraska to supply a small flock of sheep. Your death loss should not be 2 per cent. You should fatten and turn oft the old ewes before become toothlf Ehave in mind a couple of young men, nephews of mine, both of whom e been, or are now, students at the Agricultural College, who for eral years have made a success of a small band of sheep on the lines ve indicated. They got $8.30 per hundred for their lambs this fall. Ebbys are also counted amongst the most successful hog raisers, several carloads of their own breeding and fattening each year, Bee it is demonstrated that both can be kept profitably on As touched upon before, the manure produced by a flock of sheep is getting to be an item to be seriously considered. In the old ranch days, we thought the manure pile a groat nuisance and got rid of it the quickest and best we could. Today, every well-regulated Nebraska farm has a modern manure spreader and the progressive farmer converts all his straw and waste into fertilizer. You will find sheep a most valuable help in this respect. Ky advice is: try a few sheep, and I believe nine out of ten will them. It is pleasant and remunerative work. But I guess I am ?saing on somebody else's time and have bothered you long enough. In conclusion, let me say one more word to the boys who have life before them. The Nebraska farmer of today must be a good business man as well, and here is where your college course will stand you in good stead in after years. You will learn business principles of prompt - ness and integrity, and it will help you to keep the other fellow from inserting a cold rhisel between yourself and your money. Be saving by all means, but do not enter into such inseparable friendship with each dollar that you can not part with it. After you get married, as all good farmers should, take good care of your wives and get them the modern conveniences now attainable on the farms; their work is the hardest on the place, anyway. Buy good books and magazines and read them. Play the game for all it is worth, but play it on the square. The pioneers of this state have paved the way for you under great hardships, and it is no more than right that you should take off your hat to the past, but be sure and take off your coat to the future. E, stick to the soil. It is the first heritage lrom God to man. The and mainstay of our great Republic lies not in the men who amass 8 or in the dwellers of our big cities, but in the man who tills the th his own bands. </seg>

This association is devoting its efforts to improvement of the bee - keeping industry in the state and the dissemination of practical informa - tion in the keeping of bees. Much of the excellent exhibit at the State Fair is the result of the work of this association. At the last annual meeting a number of valuable papers were read which are hereinafter published. It is the purpose of the association to continue these annual reports, and the annual meeting of 1911, which will be held during the week of Organized Agriculture at Lincoln, will be full of interest and practical value to every keeper of bees. Ei important private research work and experiments in the breeding er bees is being done by members of the association and a vigor - npaign is being waged for the extermination of foul brood among 1 this state.

CALEY. COZAD, NEB In the production of fancy comb honey it is necessary to have strong colonies of bees of the right age to work in the field when the honey flow is on. This is made possible by early and continuous attention to the bees after the first days of spring. I begin by stimulative feeding early as the bees begin to fly, feeding syrup of granulated sugar regularly a small quantity, say a pint daily to each colony. Any standard type of feeder may be used. I give preferenc e to the Doolittle inside feeder. Feeding will be more profitable if a proportion of honey can be mixed with the syrup, say at least one-fourth by measurement. I make the syrup by measurement, using two parts of best granulated sugar to one part of lukewarm water. This is stirred with a paddle or large spoon until the sugar is all dissolved and no more settles to the bottom of the vessel. An excellent way to make a large quantity of syrup is to put the necessary amount of water in the honey extractor and while revolving the baskets rapidly, sift in the sugar. Almost as soon as the sugar is poured in it is dissolved by the rapid motion of the machinery and the syrup is done. It can then be covered with a cloth to exclude bees and flies and drawn off through the honey gate. </seg>

If any colonies are queenless a frame of un - brood is given to such in order that they may raise a queen. Supers are prepared in winter and in readiness for the honey flow. I use eight frame dovetailed hives with 4x5 plain sections and fence separators and full sheets of extra thin super foundation in the sections, fastened in with a Daisy foundation fastener. Fence separators will always ensure straight combs and clean sections, requiring little scraping to prepare for market Isn the first super is nearly filled raise it up and place another it, leaving the first one to be finished. The gradual finishing ! partly filled sections will give ample time for perfect ripening honey which can not be accomplished by hurrying it off the hive, queen excluding honey boards between the hive and super, ring the new wood and wire honey board which gives more for the passage of the bees. When the honey Is ready to take off use the bee escape boards. This device is inserted between the hive and super and will clear the super of bees in a few hours' time. If you have a large number of super* ready at one time they can be piled up in a tier on a tight bottom with a bee escape board on top of all, and every bee in the supers will soon b« cleared out by the use of the one board. If you have no bee escape board use a wire screen on top of the pile of supers with a cone shaped bole punched in it, the cone uppermost and the hole about the site of a lead pencil. This home-made device answers every purpose of more expensive apparatus. Kirays have extracting supers in readiness to put on as soon as the honey flow is over, as frequently the bees will make surplus ex - d honey when the flow is too sparse to get anything In the comb supers. Attention to these details will ensure a good yield of fancy honey, bringing the highest price, whenever field conditions are such tie bees can gather surplus. THE PRODUCTION OF EXTRACTED HONEY. BY J. H. WAGNER, BEATRICE. NEB. The extractor, like the movable frames, is one of the things that has made a revolution in beekeeping. It was invented in the year 1865, by Major Francesco de Hruschka, of Venice. Like a good many other inventions, its discovery was made by accident. His son chanced to put a piece of comb in a basket to which was attached a piece of rope, and in whirling it around, the centrifugal force caused a few drops of honey to be thrown out of the basket, and the father, seeing It. was keen enough to see in this a principle, and the nucleus of a big invention, and that it was not necessary any longer to mash the combs up and strain the honey </seg>
            <seg id="p358">out in the old-fashioned way. He soon constructed a rude extractor that demonstrated the practical utility of the discovery, and shortly after perfected the machine. Kig the early extractors was one made by J. L. Peabody, of this r. This was so constructed that the whole can revolved, and the ran through a hole in the center. Later, ia 1869, A. I. Root con - d what is called the Novice Honey Extractor, and through later cms till now we have the 2-4-6 and 8 frame power reversible ex- I prefer to extract my honey, although 1 have generally put a few comb honey supers on the hives. I winter my bees in the cellar, and in the spring as soon as I take them out I look through them, find out the weak and queenless hives, queen and equalize them up. After I have done this, I wait till the honey flow and the strength of the colonies warrant putting on an extra hive I use the Dovetail 8 and 10- mostly the 8-frame hives. Ii the honey fluw is on, and the combs are full, I set them up and new set under mem, then the bees lose little time in ripening t aet of combs. When the first set of combs are capped, or nearly ke them off and extract them. Let me advise you all not to take ley that Is not thoroughly ripened, for I have done this Mm* d the year 1907, and still have It Although It has never soured, ' an Inferior quality, and I will not sell a poor article of honey ow it. I use two extractors, one at my out yard, and one at my home yard. In extracting you get a far greater yield of honey per colony. What is it that gives to honey its value? It is not simply its sweetness, which is of low power; but it is its fine flavor and rich aroma. These are the qualities that make honey what it is, and if we care for Its use to be continued as a sweet sauce, we must learn to produce and care for it in such a manner as to keep Its ambrosial, palate-tickling qualities. Freshly gathered nectar is one of the most "silly" tasting and sickening of sweets. To be sure, it has the flavor of the flowers from which it was gathered; but that smooth, rich, oily, honey taste that lingers must be finished by the bees. Key extracted when "green" and evaporated in the open air not only the element that comes from its secretion by the bees, but its m-flavor is half lost by evaporation. To be sure, evaporation take place if left in the hive, but evaporation in the open air and ration in the aroma-laden air of the hive produce different results. Many of those who produce extracted honey in large quantities, ex - tracting it before it is thoroughly ripened, admit that such honey is in - ferior, as a table sauce, to that ripened by the bees, but they say that they can not afford to produce the best article possible. The quantity of honey is not materially lessened by thoroughly ripening it; if larger crops are secured by extracting it "green", it is the result of the stimulus </seg>
            <seg id="p359">given the bees by furnishing them such an abundance of empty combs. By the use of plenty of store-combs and supers, the same results, or nearly the same, may be obtained, and the ripening of honey secured by tiering up. The interest upon the cost of extra combs and supers is a small thing compared with putting unripened honey upon the market. By the use of plenty of combs, and tiering them up, the work of ex - tracting may be put off until the busy season is past or till your honey is thoroughly ripened. The great trouble is the lack of incentive for producing well-ripened honey for the general market. The production of extracted honey to be shipped away for some commission merchant to sell is much like making butter to be sold at a country store. All brings the same price. White clover brings so much, hartsease bo much. The honey with the fine flavor, the thoroughly bee-ripened, well - preserved superior article, will not bring one cent more in the general market than the ordinary fairly good honey. Perhaps, for manufacturing purposes there is no advantage in having such a superior article, but for the table use there is, and the only way In which a man who pro - duces a really superior article can hope to receive pay for his extra trouble, is by selling direct to the consumer, or by establishing a repu - tation for his honey among the dealers and their patrons. Always leave the honey on the hive a few weeks after It is thoroughly ripened and sealed. Leaving the honey on the hive a few weeks after It Is sealed seems to give an added ripeness or richness. Of course, robbers are ready to give trouble after the close of the season, but the use of the be* escape overcomes this difficulty. When the supers are freed from bees by the use of bee escapes, the honey is usually cold by the time It is off the hive. It having lost the heat Imparted to it by the bees, and It does not extract as easily as though the bees had been brushed off and the honey extracted Immediately. § proper course is to stack the supers up In a warm room, one by a stove, until the honey is warmed thoroughly, when It may wn out with greatest ease. I am aware that this system Is not followed, but I believe it has advantages over other systems, and in honey of a superior quality. Have plenty of combs and supers: tier up the same as in the production of comb honey; leave the combs on the hive until the honey is thoroughly ripened; remove the honey by the use of bee escapes, and warm it up artificially when ready to extract. This plan greatly lessens the work during the busy season, us about all there is to do is to see that surplus room Is provided. If the harvest is prolonged, lasting several weeks, it is quite likely that some of the surplus will be ready to come off before the harvest is over; and it may be best to remove them if they are be - coming piled up too high. Eems almost unnecessary tc say that I would use a queen-excluding board over the brood nest. If bee escapes are to be used the ce of brood in a super will defeat the plan, as the bees will not </seg>

If we are going to brush off the bees and extract ley at once, no honey that is thoroughly ripe can be successfully ed without throwing out. at the same time, some of the unsealed With unusually deep combs in the brood nest, it may be ad - to use the shallower combs in the supers, but with combs no than the Langsroth I doubt the advisability of having any shal - combs for supers In the production of extracted houey, there is not much to choose between the 8-frame Langstroth hive and a 10-frame one, unless out-apia - ries are to be established, when the 10-frame hives seem to enable the bees to bear neglect, to shift for themselves to better advantage. They are less likely to run short of stores. Some beekeepers use only 9 combs in a 10-frame bive, or 7 combs in an 8-frame hive, inducing the bees to lengthen out the cells and make the comb thicker. The honey ripens more slowly in such deep cells, but the uncapping is thereby greatly facilitated. Ken the combs are uncapped, the capping should be given a thorough tunlty to drain, and, if they are kept clean, the water in which are melted when they are rendered into wax, may be made into ar. I have for my uncapping can, a frame 12 in. wide, 18 in. long, I in. deep with a screen bottom which fits into a can that flta the le of the frame to catch the honey. After the honey has been thoroughly ripened, extracted, and drained into large tanks and the scum has raised, I run the clear fine flavored honey into 60 pound cans, ready for shipment After you have the extracting done, seal your cam up tight so not to lessen the flavor that the aroma gives the honey. With the approach of cold weather, honey will always candy, and if left in this state will last for years It remained sealed. To liquify It and not spoil Its fine flavor, put It where the temperature will not exceed 160 or 170 degrees. Too much care can not be used in liquifying the honey, and the screw - top should always remain closed to keep the aroma from escaping. ■ results have been varying from nothing to 5000 lbe. for one season 45 colonies. FOUL BROOD AMONG BEES BY E. WHITCOMB, FRIEND, NEB. Bacillus alvae or what is generally denominated as "foul brood," named from a Latin term which signified "sticks in the honey." Under the microscope it has the appearance of sticks cut short off and growing to a certain size, when each one explodes into a colony. It would be safe to say that these spores will increase ten or more generations in as many hours. To the bet hive it is what Asiatic cholera is to Asia or tubercu - losis to the Caucasian. Mr. Dadant in revising "Langstroth on the Honey Bee" as late as 1888 frankly admits that neither ha or Mr. L«n«stroth </seg>
            <seg id="p361">had seen a single case of "foul brood," yet Its existence is to be traced back two thousand years. Our first attention was called to its ravages in Clay county in 1S83, but it bad existed in the eastern counties long prior to that date, and the bees of the elder Trester been swept away by its deadly effects. In those early days of foul brood in this state sali acid was said to have some curative effects — but those who tried this drug failed. It took the disease fifteen years to reach Friend, a distance of thirty-one miles, and during its march eastward we attempted to stay its progress by the purchase and destruction of two colonies with a hope of making the distance so great that it would not pass over this space where there were no bees, but just at this time another small apiary was moved into this locality, and our efforts were frustrated. Prom Friend it moved eastward at a more rapid rate for the reason that apiaries were not so isolated. It attacks the larva at about the time for going Into the chrysalis stage, and instead of developing a honey bee it develops foul brood spores until some authorities assert that as many as a million of these spores have been found in a single larva. In the first stages the larva turns brown, later on to a brownish pus and finally to a mucus rather resembling coffee when cream had been added, and finally drying down in the Bide or bottom of the cell, where the bees have been known to cover with fresh honey, but seldom to attempt to remove. During the height of its ravages at Friend we noticed one of our bee - keeping neignbors filling the Infected cells with clay as a means of preventing It going farther, but afterwards we noticed that he had, like ourselves, gone out of the bee business. From what experiments and observations we were able to make, this disease will most generally yield to thorough careful treatment under the starvation plan, I.e. that of taking everything away from them, and compelling them to start anew and use the honey in their sacks for wax-making, and In which process the foul broody spores are exhausted. Bees are such Inveterate robbers that where foul brood exists in the same neighborhood it is most likely to be carried two or more times until one becomes disgusted with even an attempt at treatment. Our present system of treatment of this disease is worse than no treatment at all. Usually the Inspector of bees in any county Is one of its local bee-keepers, and he has Interests of his own to look after, and after being accused of meddling with affairs that are none of his business for a few times his ardor cools off, and his inspections are at an end. With one state inspector who has authority to appoint deputies in the infested localities this disease may in all probability be rooted out of our state. We doubt very much whether the hive in which foul brood colonies have lived is in any manner con - taminated unless diseased honey has been carelessly smeared thereon, but even this can be easily disinfected and safely used again. Treatment of foul brood colonies doesn't pay even were it successful, and It Is • much more economical plan to consign bees, hon y, wax, and frames to the purifying element of fire and start new. Prompt action in this line on the part of every bee-keeper would go a great way towards lessening the ravages of this, the bubonic plague of the beehive. </seg>
            <seg id="p362">■ PRINCIPAL INSECTS INJURIOUS TO AGRICULTURE DURING 1908-9. By Myron H. Swenk, Assistant State Entomologist. Following out the precedent established two years ago, when a sum - mary of the principal insect injuries of the years 1906-7 was prepared and published, the present account will include the cnief instances of insect damage to cereals, forage crops and vegetables which demanded the at - tention of the state entomologist, or his assistants between April 1st, 1908, and April 1st, 1910, and will also serve as an index to the activities of this office during that period. A number of serious insect pests were preva - lent within the state during the biennium and occasioned considerable louei to various crops, the details of which will be discussed In the fol - lowing pages. Among the field crop pests the chinch-bug (Bllssus leucopterus) main - tained its usual position in the front rank, and caused considerable injury and much apprehension during the spring and summer of 1908. In this year they appeared in latter April in the wheat fields of southern Ne - braska and continued there in increasing abundance up to the first of July, completely ruining many fields; after the cutting of the wheat they inflicted serious injury to corn in some localities, ihe affected are* ex - tended from Jefferson county in the vicinity of Endicott through Webster county, where they were particularly bad in the region of Red Cloud, and Furnas county around Beaver City and Cambridge, to Stratton and Tren - ton In Hitchcock county. There were also complaints of Injury to both wheat and corn from Stockvllle in Frontier county. In view of this wide - spread Injury and abundance of the insects in southern Nebraska in 1908, it is surprising that In 1909 there should have been a distinct abatement, the only reports of serious injury coming from Smithfleld in Oosper county, Arapahoe in Furnas county, and Bloomington in Franklin county, all the injury in these cases being to corn after the harvesting of the wheat. Possibly the very open character of the winter of 1908-9 had something to do with this decrease in chinch-bugs. During early August of 1908 there was unusual abundance of Geocoris bullata in the weed patches and wheat stubble of northern Hitchcock county and some farm - ers, mistaking them for true chinch-bugs, hesitated to plant wheat in the overrun fields until reassured by this office of the safety of the procedure. t Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), gave scarcely any trouble dur - 8, the only report of serious damage coming from Gilead in Thayer where it injured the wheat in certain fields by causing it to , about the middle of June. It was also reported from Harvard ' county as affecting volunteer wheat, early in the fall. In south ge county In the vicinity of Wymore there was slight injury in the </seg>

I wheat-stem maggot (Meroniyza americana) was reported as seri - injuring wheat in several localities during the summer of 1909, but was no trouble with this insect in 1908. In the vicinity of Edgar, :ounty, the wheat fields in general were damaged by this insect and whitened heads were to be observed in the fields in latter June, ame condition was reported from Mead, Saunders county, and from North Platte, Lincoln county. There was a small outbreak of the worm (Heliophila unipuncta) in Deuel county near Lewellen, in the Ie of July, 1908. The attack was practically confined to the oats ind was not extensive, and there are no records of the insect having injurious anywhere in the state in 1909. During this latter season, rer, there was considerable trouble with the wheat-head army-worm ophlla albilinia) in western Nebraska, during latter July and August, reatest damage seeming to be in the vicinity of Trenton in Hitchcock y and of Alliance in Box Butte county, where they were very abun- In the oats fields. A similar situation prevailed earlier in the season Wauneta, ■ English grain aphis (Macrosiphum granaria) was quite common wheat fields along the southern edge of the state from Thayer ' to Gage county in the spring of 1908, but no serious damage by was observed. Cut worms were notoriously Injurious during both seasons. During latter May, 1908, there were reports of cutworms In great abundance In the tame grass pastures and spreading out into the fields of clover, alfalfa, timothy, and com, to a somewhat serious extent near Unadllla, Otoe county. Other reports of great abundance of cutworms were received from near Aurora and McCook, where the moths were flying in very great abundance during the early part of June. In 1909 there was even greater and more general injury by the cutworms and not only on the corn fields I pasture lands, but also in the gardens. The predominating species ed to be Chorizagrotis introferans. The worms bothered during the three weeks of June and the last two weeks of that month there were i numbers of moths flying. Reports of injuries were received from lee, Lancaster, Dodge, Hall, Antelope and Logan counties. During September, 1908, the larvae of one of our common Tenebtionid beetles, Eleodes opaca, and probably some related species as well, were exceedingly abundant in the wheat fields of Pumas county, and caused * considerable amount of injury by gnawing at the planted seeds and com - pletely preventing their germination. This insect was made the subject of a special Investigation, the results of which were published in the Journal of Economic Entomology for October, 1909. In the fall of 1909 there were similar but less extensive injuries by these insects in the same general region, and also in Phelps county in the vicinity of Bertrand, where the larvae not only injured the planted seeds, but also late In Oc- </seg>
            <seg id="p364">tober injured the young wheat plants by gnawing at their roots and under - ground stems, in some cases completely severing the latter. In Webster county near Blue Hill and elsewhere in the state during middle April there were reports of ground gnats (Bibio sp), being found in numbers in wheat fields in which plants nad dead blades, and some anxiety was felt by the owners of the fields lest the insects injure the plant seriously, which proved, of course, to be not the case. For several years past instances of wheat fields being injured to a greater or less extent by one or the other of two species of root infesting plant lice have come to the attention of this office. One of these species, Forda occidentalis, has proved injurious in early spring up to latter April, aa well as in (he fall, during latter September and October. In 1907 It in found affecting wheat In Lancaster, Adams, Kearney, and Buffalo counties by Mr. H. S. Smith, at that time in this office, and recorded by him in the former report. Reports of injury by this insect were received in latter September from Hall county in the vicinity of Doniphan, where the lice were very abundant in the wheat fields, and had completely killed out patches of an acre or two in extent. The Insect continued active in the fields of Hall county through October and November, a report from Wood River dated November 30 recording them very abundant In the fields over small areas and killing the wheat as they spread. Another area of infestation was in Boone county near St. Edward, where the lie* were injurious during October. The other species of root louse referred to above is Geoica equamosa, and was also noted by Mr. Smith during October, 1907, at Aurora, Hamilton county, where it caused the wheat to assume a sickly appearance. During the middle of October, 1908, this speclea caused considerable damage to wheat In the vicinity of Trumbull, Clay county, where they were recorded as occurring in the fields "by the millions" and causing the plants to sicken and die. Wire-worms were not very Injurious during 1908, but in the spring of 1909 during latter May and early June there was considerable injury to corn, both by devouring and preventing the germination of the planted seed and by gnawing at the roots of the young plants, of which these Insects were the authors. The common corn wire-worm (Melanotus com - munls), and possibly some related species also were principally concerned In this damage, and the reports of greatest injury were received from Otoe, Lancaster, Dodge and Hall counties, especially the latter. In Hall county also fall wheat was affected by Drasterius elegans during latter September. Ile the corn-ear worm (Heliothis obsoleta) is annually a pest of no Importance, actually almost tithing the corn crop, even in ordinary the season of 1908 was noteworthy because of the exceeding de- Iveness of this pest. Reports commenced coming into this office Lining of very serious Injury to the maturing crop of corn early in t and continued throughout that month and through the month of nber. The trouble was quite general over the state, but seemed especially severe in the country south of the Platte river from Pill- </seg>
            <seg id="p365">more and '1 hayer counties west to Dawson, Gosper. Furnas and Frontier counties. The last four mentioned counties indeed seemed to be the cen - ter of the infestation. In this region practically every ear of corn iu affected and the majority of them devoured for the end half or third of the ear. It was quite possible to find over fifty worms of various ilw upon a single ear. At the request of several farmers in the vicinity of Gothenburg and of the then Governor George L. Sheldon who examined the fields, the writer departed for Gothenburg on September 23, and on the next day examined a large number of fields in the vicinity of that city. All of the fields examined were seriously damaged; one field of 140 acres had practically every ear in it ruined by the worms, many of them not having started to fill, owing to the complete consumption of the silk, others being eaten to the cob from base to tip. In this field a very un - usual condition prevailed, namely, many stalks were bored into at the Joints by these worms to such an extent that some were falling over be - cause of the attack. Young volunteer corn plants springing up in the fields planted to various crops were being consumed by very tiny to half - grown larvae. 18 to 2&gt;&gt; such worms being frequently found in the bud of a single young plant. I was informed that the condition about Gothen - burg was quite typical of those prevailing throughout Dawson county and the counties to the south of it. Rbly one explanation of the unprecedented abundance of these in the region mentioned was that there were practically no evi - of parasitic infestation among them, at least not among those still ing on the ears. At this time of year the worms were leaving the large numbers to pupate, and as the soil was gumbo land and rery i time was not available to Investigate the conditions of these g individuals. (g 1909 the corn-ear worm was wholly back to its normal numbers t nearly so seriously injurious as in the preceding years. The f this decrease is probably due to natural conditions and favorable rather than to parasitic control. Also throughout the infested the writer advocated the practice of early planting, so that the period would be over before the emergence of the third brood of and as this was given wide publicity it was probably quite largely , at least in the severely infested district. In the more eastern portions of the state during both seasons covered by this report corn was injured sometimes to a serious extent by the com root aphis (Aphis maidi-radiris) ; reports of serious injury were received from Colfax county in 1908 and Gage county in 1909. During 1908 there was an unusual abundance of the corn leaf aphis (Aphis maidis) through - out the corn-growing sections of the state, not only on corn but on sor - ghum. In the vicinity of Gothenburg at the time the corn fields were be - ing examined for the corn-ear worm this aphis was exceedingly abundant and was certainly responsible to some extent for the very poor condition of the corn. At the bases of the leaves where they ensheathed the stalk, this being the only place where the corn was still green and succulent at </seg>
            <seg id="p366">this time of year, they were clustered in exceedingly large numbers. The lady-bird Hippodaiuia convergens was very abundant In these fields, feed - ing rapaciously on these lice. An unusual abundance of this aphis was also reported from the vicinity of Omaha and Lincoln. The northern corn root-worm (Diabrotica longicornis) was more destructive than usual during 1909. Evidences of serious depredations by this insect were noted near Beemer, Cuming county, and Weeping Water, Cass county. In toe vicinity of Cowles, Webster county, during 1909 there was injury to planted seed corn by the seed-corn ground-beetle (Agonoderus pall i pee), and, according to our correspondents, there have been similar troubles with this Insect in that vicinity for several years past During both 1908 and 1909 there were isolated cases of serious damage by the timothy bill bug (Sphenophorus parvulus) to young corn plants where these had been planted on land broken from timothy sod the preceding year. In 1908 near Pilger, Nebraska, a field had its stand of corn practically taken by middle May by these insects, which were clustered as many as a dosen on a stalk. In 1909 there were reports of serious injury early in June from the vicinity of Bruning and Fairfleld. tiw enemy of the corn plant came to notice in early July, 1909, in rm of the small metallic green beetle (Colaspis favosa). The work mostly along the edges of the leaves and gnaw the leaves holes. The injury, while not extensive enougu to be serious, might become so if the beetles became more abundant The injury oc - near Farwell, Howard county. A really tremendous amount of grain is lost every year in Nebraska through the attack of stored grain pests after the grain has been stored in the granary. During both years covered by this report, as well as in preceding years, this has been emphatically true. Of course the insect most concerned in this destruction is the common grain weevil (Calandra granaria), but there is also considerable loss because of the frequent ex - cessive abundance of the saw-tooth grain-beetle (Silvanus surinamensis). This beetle also proves a frequent nuisance by Infesting flour, breakfast food, and the cereal products, raisins and sugar. There have also been serious losses in seed corn and stored flour and meal through the activity of the meal snout-moth (Pyralis farinalis). All of these pests are quite widespread. The counties from which the majority of the reports of the grain weevil have come are Lancaster, Saline, Nuckolls, Webster, Frank - lin, Merrick, Ouster, Dixon, and Cass. The saw-tooth grain-beetle was reported as injurious from Lancaster, Jefferson, and Holt counties, while the snout-moth had its center of injury in Buffalo and Custer counties. I ing both 1908 and 1909 there was very serious damage by grass - rs in the southern and western portions of the state, especially dur - 09. During 1908 the most serious injury occurred in Furnas, Fron - nd Dawson counties, in the alfalfa fields during July and early Au - when many fields were largely stripped of their leaves and later 11 wheat was eaten off as it appeared above ground by these same There was also some damage in the vicinity of Gering, Scottsbluff </seg>
            <seg id="p367">county, in July of that year. In 1909, however, the damage from grass - hoppers was much more extensive and serious than the preceding season. The center of damage embraced the counties of Furnas, Frontier, Gosper, Dawson, Harlan, and Franklin, especially in the vicinity of Oxford, Beaver City, Wilsonville, Stockville, Curtis. Smithfield, Gothenburg, Stamford, Bloomington, and Franklin. There was also a local outbreak in Boyd county in the northern part of the state. The grasshoppers were present in great abundance and played havoc in the alfalfa fields in the region first mentioned, some fields being completely stripped. This occurred during July and the first ten days of «.ugust. There was also some dam - age reported in small grain fields, but tnis was not anywhere to be com - pared in importance with the losses of alfalfa. \\ it h startling unanimity the complaints of the grasshopper damage addressed to this office were accompanied by requests for grasshopper fungus, and as for some years past no attempts have been made here to keep the cultures in stock for sending out because of the exceedingly doubtful value of such efforts, these requests could not be supplied. If the farmers of the state would adopt generally the practice of disking their alfalfa in the spring, as well as adjacent old breakings and roadsides, in order to destroy the grass - hopper eggs, use the criddle mixture and zealously apply the hopper-dozer to infested fields a great portion of this grasshopper damage could be The winter of 1908-9 was again marked by rather widespread injury by the clover-hay worm (Hypsopygia costalis). This insect was found working in stacks of alfalfa and ciover hay and in one instance in timothy hay also, both in the barn and in the stacks in the field. The work of the wintering brood of moths seems to reach its climax in March, but there Is also considerable complaint in May and June. The insect seems to bo widely distributed in the state, the principal injuries dur.ng 1909 occur - ring in Douglas, Saunders, Nemaha, Madison, liawson, and Furnas coun- In this connection it mig,.i be mentioned that there have been com - plaints of a tiny larva working in the heads of red clover, which may pos - sibly be the larva of this insect, or, as is more likely, that of the clover - seed caterpillar (Enarmonia interstictana), a point which can be deter - mined only when we have been able to secure and rear specimens of this larva. A considerable portion of a fifteen-acre field of clover was injured to a small extent by this larva during middle August, 1908. Sring 1908 and up to early May of 1909 there continued to be numer - instances of the clover mite (Bryobia pratensls), invading houses, luring the summer and winter of 1909 this nuisance seemed to have st disappeared. This invasion was a continuation of the one which ed in the fall of 1907 and continued through the following winter, e insects seem to work extensively on the clover lawns, sometimes jptibly weakening the plants, and are also abundant on rose bushes mulberry trees. The infested area covered most of the scate, as de - 1 In the former report. During late September and early October of 190j there were more re- </seg>
            <seg id="p368">ports of an unusual abundance of the western cottony grass scale (Briop - coloradensis) in western Nebraska. It continued to be abundant in the vicinity of Wauneta, Chase county, and new regions of infestation were reported from Calvert. Dundy county, and Chappel, Deuel county. The farmers seem to hesitate greatly to teed infested hay to stock, al - though it is extremely unlikely that this would be followed by any ill ef - fects. The scale is quite heavily parasitized, and a more complete ac - count of this feature as well as of the life-history of the scale will be published elsewhere at an early date. Blue grass lawns in various sections of the state are every year being either rendered unsightly or completely killed out by the presence of large numbers of white grubs (Lachnosterna sp.) among the roots of the grass. These grubs completely devour away the rods, killing the plants in large patches and completely loosening the turf. Injury is first noticeable about the l"th of May and continues through the summer up to the first of Sep - tember. During 1908 there were many complaints of this kind, as well as injury to corn, strawberries, potatoes, etc., by these insects. The center of injury by the white grubs embraced the counties of Custer, Dawaon, Kearney, Franklin. Adams, and Thayer. There were also serious injuries in Cass counties. Iestern Nebraska there have been reports of injury in alfalfa fields the presence of the prairie ant (Pogonomyrmex occidentals ), inch i coming chiefly from Hitchcock and Lincoln counties. In citiea of i Nebraska, notably Omaha, Lincoln, and Hastings, there has been to lawns by the hills of the black ant, while the little black ant aiorium minutum) has been reported from both eastern and west - braska as a pest in houses. Ej year there is injury by the Colorado potato beetle (Doryphora ta), and the seasons of 1908 and 1909 were no exceptions. The neral over the state. Also from eastern Nebraska was re - injury by the potato flea-beetle (Epitrix cucumeris) during latter : 1909. The potato stalk weevil (Tricnobaris trinotata) was quite severely in - jurious in northeastern Nebraska during 1908. Fieias in the vicinity of Dakota City examined by a representative of this office during latter July, 1908, showed that nearly two-thirds of the vines in most of the fields ex - amined were more or less infested, usually a single weevil in each stalk, but occasionally two or three. These badly infested plants wilt down or die. Some fields in which a careful rotation is practiced Bhowed much less injury, only one or two per cent of the vines being affected, especially when the practice of raking and burning the vines as soon as they are dead was observed. Potatoes throughout the state were more or less in - jured by the stalk borer (Papiapema nitela). Ratter May, June, and July of 1908 there was an extraordinary abun - of the false chinch-bug (Nysius angustatus) all over the western lirds of the state, especially in Knox.

There was also slight damage by this insect during midd.e June of 1909. It is interesting to mention in this connection a flight of the bug Corlsua ni - grosternum, which occurred in Pierce and Knox counties September 23 - 24, 1908, in which these Insects visited the towns of Wausa and Plainvlew During both years there has been damage all over the state by the om - nipresent cabbage worm (Pieris), which is a great truck pest in the state and one which the majority of the people do not know how to deal with. Reports of the pea- weevil (Bruchorus pisorum) were received in 1909 from Boone and Antelope counties. The bean-weevil also was injurious In Wayno county the same year. I dens in the vicinity of Lincoln were more or less injured by the leaf beetle (Ceratoma trifurcata) during latter June of 1909, this the first instance of injury by this insect in Nebraska of which we record. The melon aphis (Aphis gossypii, for a number of years past has been one of the most destructive of all our insect pests of the garden, in many localities practically taking the crop of cucumbers, muskmelons, and watermelons. The actual loss through the ravages of this pest must amount to thousands of dollars annually, as there is no insect concerning which there is a more persistent inquiry than this one. A series of ex - periments was begun in 1MM and continued more intensively during 1909 with the object in view of discovering a feasible means of controlling this aphis in its relation to our cucurbit crops. It is expected that these ex- periments will be concluded during 1 hood be included in next year's report 1" and a report will in all likeli - jf the entomologist.

This trouble is general over the state and the common cat and dog flea (Pulex serratieeps) Is the species most concerned. Another pest of general distribution is the chicken mite, while the sheep tick was reported as a pest during 1908. </seg>
            <seg id="p370">GERMINATING SEED CORN. In Nebraska one of the most practical subjects for discussion by a farmer is the question of seed corn. In order to hold our proud position as third corn-producing state ot the Union it is necessary for us to use ■dentine principles in the selection of proper seed, and the time to begin is now. The first principle of importance is the vitality of the corn in - tended for planting; therefore we shall discuss the method by which you can accurately test the quality of your seed corn. In order to do this make a germinating box, of any size you may find most convenient for your especial needs, from two to four inches deep, in which place about one inch of well-packed sawdust, on which lay a piece of good muslin or canton flannel marked into squares two inches in size, numbered from one up. Make a careful selection of the type of eacn ear of corn which seems to conform with your ideal of standard; lay and number the ears, beginning at one. Take ear No. 1 in your hand, and with the point of a pocket knife remove a kernel from the ear at about one inch from the butt. Give the ear a quarter turn either to the right or left and remove the second kernel from the center ot the ear. Make another quarter turn and remove the third kernel about \Vz inches from the tip of the ear. Holding the ear in the same position, remove kernel No. 4 about an inch from the butt of the ear. Make another quarter turn and take the fifth kernel from near the center of the ear, another quarter turn and take the sixth kernel from about Hi inches from the tip of the ear. Kear has now been turned around and two kernels taken from near ltt two from near the center, ana two from near the tip. If the has been well done each set of two kernels has been removed from y opposite sides of the ear. Take the six kernels of corn extracted from ear No. 1 which has been laid down, germ side up. Tne side of the kernel containing the germ is toward the tip of the ear, and care must be taken not to injure the germ in handling. Place them tip and germ side up in square No. 1, take the kernels from ear No. 2 and so on. Be careful that the ears are numbered and arranged so that you will know positively out of which ear each six kernels were taken. After your squares are filled take a piece of muslin or canton flannel about the size of the inside of your box and lay it carefully over tne ker - nels so as not to disturb their original position, thoroughly wet the saw - dust and cloth, then over the top spread another piece of muslin or canton flannel, which should be much wider than the box, so that when the bal - ance of the box is filled with sawdust the ed^es of the upper cloth can be folded back over the sawdust which js thoroughly pressed down and sat - urated with water. If this is done, when you desire to examine the seed you can commence at one end and roll the upper cloth with enclosed saw - dust so that same will not disturb the grains of corn under the second If sawdust is not to be had easily, folded canton flannel thoroughly gat- </seg>
            <seg id="p371">Kwith water above and below and covered with a pane of glass will d quite a good substitute. Place the germinating box at a place where the temperature Is from 65 to 85 degrees F. The temperature such as is found near the stove in an ordinary country home very nearly approaches these conditions. It la important that the temperature should not fall below 55 degrees so as to not afTect the reliability of the test. The kernels should begin to germ - inate freely about the third or fourth day, but the counting should not be done before the 7th or 8th day, when the stems should be from one to one and one-half inches in length. This is the part of the testing In which your good judgment is required. Ehe six kernels from one square in the germinating box show six healthy sprouts, the ear from which they were taken should be taken Jd. If one of the six kernels fails to germinate or gives even a weak r stem, the ear which it represents Will be more profitably used for lan seed, as under the most favorable condition the stalk from same e either barren or produce only a nubbin. Use only those ears for rom which every kernel responds with a good, healthy sprout. Isr the selection of ears showing perfect germination is made, care - ihell one ii.ch from the butt and tip and use the balance of the corn the ear for seed. It is desirable that the seed be shelled by hand ereoned if convenient, in order to secure more uniform results in In one acre of corn planted 3% feet apart there are 3,556 hills. The entire corn product of Nebraska for 19( In length to the nill, or an average of ally there are three stalks of corn to I principles we can raise even two 8 to 75 bushels from the acre just as easily 8 only averaged one ear six Inches 28:17 bushels to the acre. Oener - :he hill, and if by proper scientific • inch ears to the hill we can take as we are now taking 28. It is surprising to go through a corn rection, and notice the number of hilli nubbins. Oftentimes it runs as high a field and count 100 hills, in any di - i which are barren or yielding but s 50 per cent and very seldom less 115 per cent. If your field is in the latter class you are just throw - ray one-quarter of your labor, for man and team used in preparing nd, planting and cultivating the crop. Does it pay to do all this ex - &gt;or in order to save the trouble of conducting this germinating test, to be sure you have seed that will grow : Baking this test you will be surprised in the created interest it gives young people of your household. This fact alone is worth a great i the farm home. Do anything to create an interest in the work farm, and by keeping the young people interested in farm work 11 be building well for the future. ■some communities the school children test the corn for farmers In district for ten cents per bushel and use the proceeds In purchasing needed article for their school. </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 PREPARATION OF SEED BED FOR CORN PLANTING. One of the important duties on the farm for the month of April Is the preparation of the seed bed for corn planting, which planting in Nebraska -ually commenced by the 20th of April and finished by the 10th of Probably the ideal seed bed for corn in parts of the state where there inilant moisture would be an alfalfa field plowed up in the fall and ■ its rough state through the winter; but alfalfa fields are yet too • • in Nebraska for any great number of farmers to avail themselves .. h an opportunity, and very many of our cornfields must necessarily anted on land which bore a crop of corn last year. It is too late now, however, to dwell upon what should have been done last fall, so we will devote our attention to present season methods. If you are to use Mubble ground for corn, or if your planting is to be on land which was In eon last year, thoroughly double disk and, on the corn land, disk across the field and then around it or disk diagonally, so as to level up the land and cut up the old stalks and trash before plowing or listing. In case of heavy cornstalks some farmers prefer to break the stalks down with a heavy harrow or railroad iron, rake into windrows and burn, but we be - that all plant food should oe conserved, and by a little additional lrbor in using a stalk cutter before disking, plowing deep, and weil firm - ing the seed bed, which is made more possible from the disking before :ng, the fertility and capillary qualities of your land are conserved. Of the most important things to be avoided is "clods," which prevent the firming of the soil at the bottom of the furrow and prevents the plant from obtaining sufficient moisture. En you plow, add an extra horse to your team and attach one aec - ' the harrow to follow on the newly turned ground after the plow. s method the subsoil will be more thoroughly firmed, and the sur - ned under the favorable conditions then existing, as the section of rrow will cover all the ground plowed about three times. The objects of plowing are to alter the texture of the so»l to a consid - erable depth and to bury completely any vegetauie or other organic mat - ter on the surface of the ground, as weeds absorb the moisture which is needed for the crop. Do not plow when the ground is so wet that the bottom of the furrow slice turns up slick and the particles of soil run together rather than crumble. Such a surface will bake in the sunshine and the clods thus formed will sometimes remain unchanged during the entire season. Do not fail to use your harrow if any length of time in - tervenes between plowing and planting, so as to stir the surface after rain or kill the weeds before planting. It is a splendid help in firming a seed bed to take a good four-horse team and a heavy roller and roll the field before planting. Newly germinated weeds have few roots and are easily torn loose by harrowing; therefore use the harrow freely. Pro - fessor Bowman says that weeds and grass allowed to grow up in corn - stalk land in the spring, before plowing, are injurious to the physical con- </seg>
            <seg id="p373">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 373 I of the soil because they compact and harden the surface, which In Hows the rapid evaporation of moisture. When this green mat is I under later it acts as a partition between the furrow slice and the a of the furrow. Weeds also utilize a large amount of available food, which is always scarce in spring-plowed ground, and at the time the decaying green material renders the soil more or less acid. I it coating of manure from a spreader over your corn land is very al, but refrain from spreading green manure too thickly, as rot - sen manure requires a great deal of moisture, which must neces - « drawn from the surface soil, and often causes the furrow slice me very dry within a lew days. In parts of Nebraska where there is ample rainfall we would recom - mend that the check-rower be used in planting. Some farmers prefer listing, claiming that it stands drouth better, is easier to kill the weeds, and the corn stands up better under a high wind. Take a little pride in trying to get the rows perfectly straight, as the satisfaction you will ex - perience all through the season will amply repay you for the trouble. A farmer is oftentimes judged by the little things about his farm, which some think make no particular drfference. Use a rigid neckyoke on your planter, and do not urge your team too much. Do not fall to know that the planter or lister ia working properly, so that the stand may be as nearly perfect ai possible. Ell plowing or on stubble ground when It Is considered desirable to not plant with your litter, but use the corn planter with check- In lister furrow. The satisfaction experienced by after results ipljr repay. CORN CULTIVATION The use of a harrow permits a large amount of surface to be covered In a short time, young sprouting weeds are killed and other weed teed cultivated so it will sprout, and the more sprouting of weed seeds early the cleaner the ground after corn is laid by. Harrowing also prevents che formation of a crust and is one of the greatest factors in retaining moisture for future growth of the plant. The amount of rainfall must be considered in the use of the harrow. During wet. cloudy periods the har - row cultivates grass and weeds in the field rather kills them; sunshine is a great factor for good results in harrowing. The very first thing be - fore the corn comes up some good farmers advocate the cultivation of each row with a double shovel plow, followed with harrowing crosswise, which serves the double purpose of leveling the field and killing the weeds. I ions differ as to the advisability of harrowing corn after the plant through the ground. Some claim that it is just the proper thing •ow until the corn Is six inches tall, while others claim that a large tage of the plants — in some cases as high as 25 per cent — is cot - p or broken off by harrowing, and that it is the better way to wait t can be cultivated. Always give the field three cultivations and </seg>
            <seg id="p374">J74 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kible give it four or better still five. Always cultivate as soon after as possible, so as to conserve moisture. A field well cared for usu - ves double the yield gathered from one that receives but one or ltivations. If the field is level we would advise the use of a riding cultivator, but if hilly it is almost necessary to use ;i walking cultivator. Alter culti - vating corn all day a man is much more ambitious to do the chores when having had the benefit of riding. Never keep your team in the field more than five hours at a stretch and not to total more than ten hours in any one day. A team working ten hours per day will walk further during the season than the team that works longer. Regularity in work is what counts in animals as well as men. When you take the horses to the barn at night give them a good currying and rubbing down; never speak to them above an ordinary tone of voice; do not strike or abuse them and do not keep a hired man who does. In a very short time horses will learn to treat you as you treat them. As you would have men and animals treat you, so treat them. Some have asked us to recommend some eer tain cultivator. We do not care to do that, but advise each and every reader to attend the next State Fair at Lincoln, September 5th to 9th, where can be seen all the various kinds of farming implements shown by expert*; and when you have determined -ne particular kind best adapted to your needs have your home dealer order it for you. FINISHING CORN CULTIVATION. It a closing word on laying by the corn. Most of the fields are now cultivated for the last time, and Nebraska corn is Indeed promls- The question which concerns a good farmer is "How can I improve leld of my corn field?" When we carefully figure up the time we have already spent in bring - ing the soil to a proper tilth and the corn to its present conditions, will it pay us to add just a little more labor if we can further Increase the yield? We tnlnk It will, and therefore wish to urge that the field be gone over with a single horse five-tooth cultivator, which will destroy the young weeds, level the ground, and conserve the moisture for the corn itself. This should be done twice at least, the first time commencing about July 15th and the second time during the first week in August. Should a heavy rain occur near the times stated, follow with cultivation as quickly as you can get on the ground. Doubtless you will say this is too much work when we are busy in grain and hay fields, but it will easily pay an expenditure of $3 per day. This is not theory, but is gathered from actual experience, for it was the plan followed by the boy at Gretna who raised 102 bushels on a single acre last year while his father's field adjoining, cultivated in the usual old - fashioned manner, went only 35 bushels to the acre. Three years ago, in competition for the prize offered in the acre-corn contest by the State Board of Agriculture, Harry Olderog of Gretna raised 118 bushels and 30 </seg>
            <seg id="p375">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 375 pounds from a single acre and finished up his cultivation in this manner. With such facts confronting you can you afford to miss your opportunity? SELECTING SEED CORN Now is the time to go into the cornfields and select the seed for next spring's planting. There are several reasons why seed should be selected at this time. A study of the growing ear on the stalk is very important. The contrast in height of stalk and height of ear will be found to repro - duce in a marked degree from year to year. In eastern Nebraska four feet from the ground is a desirable height for the ear, while farther west in the state the distance will gradually diminish. The size and length of the Bi should be taken into consideration. A large shank shows a lack of ing and Is usually accompanied by a large cob. A very slender shank ometlmes break and allow the ear to fall to the ground before it is 1. An upright ear Is to be criticised, as rain enters the husks and i rotting. Etalk should be studied. A weak and slender stalk is undesirable, large at the base, gradually tapering Indicates strength and vigor, ch foliage la not desirable. Such a corn plant will make good fod- I does not usually produce the best ear. The maturity of the ear be considered. Those showing early signs of maturity should be I, even If they are a little smaller than other ears which are slow Ting. K going through the fields at this time and selecting three time* more than will be needed, and hanging it up where it will dry out thor - y, before freezing weather, will also Insure seed with strong germ - g power. During the winter the seed can be gone over carefully, hose ears having undesirable features and low germinating power e thrown out. DANGER SIGNALS By Col. F. M. Woods I will speak of conditions in the West fifty and sixty years ago. My father emigrated from Vermont to Illinois in 1842. He thought he was going away out west. It was then, but it is back east now. Chicago, his nearest railroad station, was eighty miles away. He used to haul his wheat there and sell it for 30 cents per bushel; oats for 12 cents; dressed pork for $1.25 per hundred; eggs 4 cents per dozen; and he thought he was doing well. In fact, I never heard him complain. Often the roadi were so bad he would mire from three to four times on a trip, then he would have to carry the bags one by one to a dry spot and would often have to take the wagon apart and draw out part of it at a time. There were but few horses in those days. All the work was done with oxen. I have plowed corn many a day with an ox with a basket tied over his head. </seg>
            <seg id="p376">Wo lived in a three-room log house. It was the hest house that I ever saw. It was cool iu summer and nn iu winter, and never in all my life sii.ee have I beard such music as the patter of rain on those old oak shin - gles. Sleep was sweet and refreshing. Nothing to worry about. Every one was a little world unto himselt ami ran it to suit himself. Did we have plenty to eat.' you ask. Plenty. Why. we had a passover. We had wheat flour, buckwheat flour, and cornmeal in quantities to burn. In the cellar you would find potatoes, turnips, and all other kinds of vegetables, and. as the Dutchman :-aid. a couple barrels of sauerkraut to have on hand in case of sickness. You would find smoked hams, bacon, salt pork, dried beef, corned beef, all kinds of wild canned fruits such as plums, crab - upples, strawberrieG, and blackberries. My mother always had a jar of fried cakes, mince pies, and cold chicken on hand. Wild game, deer, prairie chickens, partridges, geese, and ducks could be had on short no - tice. There may be such commissary departments nowadays, but I do not know where they are. We cut our grain with a cradle and our grass with a scythe. Finally came the McCormick reaper, with which we raked off the grain, and then later the John P. Manny self-rake. We had the first one In our county, and I remember the first day It started; more than a dozen neighbor* had gathered to see it work. They all looked very sober and said it wm a wonderful Invention but the death blow to labor. In those days a good man got flOO a year and board, and they were easy to get If you can get one at all now he costs $375 per year and board and you have to keep a hone for him. He won't do chores Sundays, nor milk cows. In Im - portance he is only outranked by the present-day hired girl. She limply states her price and tells you what days In the week she will be in to as - sist about the work. Fifty years ago they got $1.25 per week and would milk five cows every night and morning. I remember I used to drive a breaking plow for 25 cents per day and take my supper and breakfast at Sixteen and a half years after I was born came the Civil War. It had no more than closed than a new army composed of veterans of that con - flict turned their faces westward to achieve new victories. You know what they did. You know, many of you by personal experience, of the suffering and privation they endured before you converted what was then known as the great American desert into what it is now. the garden spot of the United States, occupied by the most intelligent, energetic, law - abiding, loyal citizens of this great republic. In fifiy years the states of unsin, Illinois. Minnesota, and the Dakotas increased in population from a trifle over 1. ■ 11,684.000. Kansas and Nebraska alone at the last censu6 had 2,563,795. Nebraska today ranks third as a corn - producing state and her fields of alfalfa are veritable mines of gold, not only to produce cash, but to restock the land with nitrogenous food. The men who wrought this change were men of grit. "Grit makes the man. The lack of it, the chump. The men who win grab hold, hang on. and hump." </seg>
            <seg id="p377">The poor, struggling boy in any of the walks of life who has succeeded has been possessed of that grit. It is told of E. H. Harriman, who was the son of a poor minister who preached for $200 per year, when a small boy he started out to find a job in the city of New York. He came to • store where a card was out, "Boy Wanted." He took down the card and walked in. He met the proprietor, who indignantly asked him why he took down that sign. "Why," said he, "you won't want it up any longer, as I'm going to take the job." And he did. You know the rest. Thirty years after the country was startled by the news that one E. H. Harriman of New York had offered the United States government »o8,0u0,000 cash and assumed a bonded indebtedness of $27,000,000 for the rundown, bank - rupt Union Pacific railroad. It was an elephant on the government's hands and was decreasing in value every day. J. P. Morgan had tried to finance it, but gave it up as a bad job; but under the guidance of the gritty American uoy in six years it was paying its stockholders 6 per cent on their cash invested, and if he had not died when he did he probably would have absorbed the whole railroad system of the country. ■the boy of today who thinks there is no longer a chance, remember ill Harriman had when he started out in life was assurance and grit, i all his ups and downs that part of his capital he never lost. Marshall Field swept out the store and cleaned the spittoons for $5 per week and died worth $100,000,000. He had the grit. Land In those days could be had for the taking, but these men of grit have now made it worth $100 to $300 per acre. Practically speaking, the public lands are gone I he majority of the older portions have been cropped to the limit, *s owners and greedy tenants have checked upon them year after decade after decade without putting anything back. As the light - on the sea looms up to warn the ship to keep off the rocks, so great noils rise on the land as warning signals saying to the farmer, bank account In this farm is getting low. You must go to deposit - ' your checks will soon go to protest" James J. Hill says that In a large portion of the country the productivity of the soil has decreased 50 per cent, and I know he is right. Twenty - eight bushels of corn to the acre In the United States in 1908! Why, one ear to the hill at the rate of luO ears to the bushel Is thirty-seven bushels per acre. Two ears to the hill, sixty-four bushels. A man should raise three ears to the hill. That would give mm 100 bushels to the acre. But just think, the corn in the United States last year did not average three - fourths of an ear to the hill. What is the matter. Too many men check - ing on the bank and putting nothing back. Too many men trying to raise two crops at the same time on one piece of land. A crop of weeds and a crop of grain. Too many men taking it easy when they ought to be plowing corn. A boy once asked his father where Easy street was. "FT, son." said he, "it is a street down at the end of Hard Work street, and you can not get to it by going any other way." Poor cultivation, poor seed, poor soil accounts for so poor a yield, and yet corn is our most valu - able crop, and I can not but think that with the desire for improvement </seg>
            <seg id="p378">that exists today that it will not be many years until, by the aid of good seed, good soil, and good work, we will at least double the amount raised on the same amount of land. I think it would pay the states and counties to offer prizes for the best piece of corn, to be not less in any case than forty acres. Nebraska boys produced this year over 100 bushels to the acre, so we can see what is possible. "But," says the farmer, "how shall I make those deposits you are talking so much about?" There are nu - merous answers to that question. It can be done through alfalfa, or clover, or peas. But I think the cheapest and surest and the way you know the most about is to do it through stock. "A cow, and a sow, a ewe, mare, and hen Produce financial salvation for men; And then in addition if you have a good wife There is nothing to hinder you enjoying life." Feed stock. What kind of stock? you ask. That is easy. Good stock. If you feed it to poor stock it is one-half wasted. I know a man in Ne - braska who lately sold his farm of 500 acres for (60,000. "Big price," •ays one. "Oh, no," says a neighbor, "that farm is very rich. They have Always kept lots of stock. For the last twenty years they have never had leas than 126 head of thoroughbred cattle, and It takes one team all the time to keep the manure drawn out. Why, sir, their corn this rear (1909) it husking eighty bushels to the acre. The cow made the manure and manure made the corn." Said another neighbor, "Their pasture will furnish feed for twice as many cattle as the average pasture." They have top-dressed It bo often that It will keep a cow to the acre and then it is not eaten down close. Such a farm will always sell for $25 to $40 more to the acre than one that has been robbed. I saw my father's old farm cropped and cropped, and I am ashamed to say I helped to do it, un - til twenty-five to thirty bushels of corn was the maximum yield. I sold it In that condition in 1871 for $35 per acre. This fall I went back there and saw a field of corn that would husk at least eighty bushels per acre, the land producing seemingly better than it did fifty years ago. What did it? I found a Swede there milking eighty cows, selling nothing but the cream, putting everything else back into the land. I asked him the value of the land now, and he said he could sell for $150 per acre. That shows what stock will do for land. That Swede, they told me, first rented the land. Now he owns it. He is growing richer every day and so is his farm. But where you find one farm that has been so intelligently treated you will find ten tiiat have raised the danger signal. Ten that are not producing thirty bushels to the acre because the "modus operandi" has been all checks and no deposits. In my judgment Illinois is suffering from tenantism worse than any other of the corn belt states. The Lord gave to Illinois almost the rich - est soil in the world. It responded and responded until they came to think it was inexhaustible. Much of it is rich yet and producing bountifully, but at least one-half of their land some time ago reached the limit and Is </seg>
            <seg id="p379">going fast the other way. You may travel for 200 miles in some pens of the state and not see as much stock as you will see in Iowa on the average section of land. Swift's man told me that last year they shipped 2,000 carloads of fertilizer from Chicago to the southern states, when, he said, every pound ought to have stayed in Illinois. And then the soil losses from washing are something appalling. The Commissioner of Soils at Washington says that the amount of dirt annually washed into the creeks and rivers and finally into the sea is equal to a pile of dirt one mile long, one mile wide, and 1,000 feet high, or 1,000 farms of 640 acre* each with a soil depth of one foot Thousands of farms in the South are already gone. Twelve thousand farms in New York state alone checked dry and washed away. What is to be done to prevent all this waste? Grass the land and get it into sod as quickly as possible or you will leave your grandchildren with an empty bank account. Mr. Farmer, you don't own this land; you are simply the agent of the Almighty; you are ■Im - ply for the time being the officer in charge of the bank, and If you allow its funds to be washed and squandered, thereby endangering the inter - ests of the millions yet to come who must depend as have you on this same land for life itself, the law should hold you accountable. » Nebraska Farmer, take warning from the mistake* of others and by their errors. Don't think as Illinois did, that any land can get fh to raise good stock on. Do your work with mares that will raiM ling colt that will bring at least $200 each and often $500, or work' that sell now as geldings at $300 to $500 each. Today a good pair king horse* weighing 1,800 pounds each with quality will sell from o $1,000 per span. Twenty-seven head did sell In Sioux City this fall at auction for an average of $423 each. Keep a good stallion and make him work on the farm. He will be that much surer a breeder. A good stallion will breed your own mare* and earn enough outside to pay the salary of two or three hired men. Keep some good cows, sort them out just as carefully as you sort your *eed corn. I sold the University Farm of Nebraska a Shorthorn cow for $160 that made this year, under the management of Professor Haecker, 494 pounds of butter, and the bull calf she raised sold for $200. But call her average calf $75. You can make a steer of it and get that Suppose a farmer selects and gets together twenty-five or thirty such cows. He has a good salary and they are making the farm and himself richer and richer. They have a dozen cows at the University Farm that make the report of the above-mentioned cow look small, but they are cows trained in that particular line. I thin*, there is no animal on the farm equal to a good cow intelligently cared for. Ed way to keep water in your tank is to calk up all the small holes, way to Increase your revenue from the farm is to eliminate waste, the greatest wastes of the farm is the waste of manure. Two - &gt;f the farmers do not get much good from what manure they do It is left scattered here and there on side hills, on cow yards, on f creeks, exposed to the rains and floods, only to have the moat </seg>
            <seg id="p380">valuable parts soak out and wash away. The nitrogen and other soil foods are lost and the humus only left for the farm. I air. told that in Belgium a fanner has large ponds cemented like cisterns and everything on that farm from a chicken's leg to a cock of old hay, a dead horse, or a bushel of frozen potatoes are dumped into that vat and soaked and rotted and when they want to fertilize they draw off the liquid and with sprink - ling wagons sprinkle it over the land, and they say a Belgian farmer will produce as much profit on forty acres as the average Nebraska farmer does on 160. That is intensive farming. In Belgium 30,000,0u0 people live on a piece of land about as large as the First congressional district of Iowa. If Iowa were populated as thickly as Belgium she could contain the entire population of tae United States. The University Farm here produced this year sixty tons of roots on two acres. This is Intensive farming. That is what we have got to come to If the millions to follow are to be saved from starvation. Then the secret of feeding. That is where the American farmer falls down. A Belgian, French, or English farmer has no trouble in making his two - year-old colts weigh a ton. The American farmer lacks 500 pounds of it. and that Is why the word "Imported" may mean so much to all kinds of stock. Climatic conditions alone may make It Impossible for us to ever equal them, as impossible as it is for an American manufactured cloth to equal Imported goods. Owing to their damp climate In England they can spin a thread so much smaller and finer and therefore stouter that the wearing value of the goods is nearly doubled. We have In vain tried to produce artificial dampness In our factories to assist them to ob - tain the same results, but failed. The water there In which their wool is washed gives it a character that can not, up to this time, be produced here, so the word "imported" clotn must always stand for superior good* as the word "Imported" animal will generally mean superior stock. But going back to the subject of manure. It Is a rich subject and I hate to leave It I was forcibly struck last June, m traveling through New England, with the way the farmers there care for their manure They save it as carefully as they do their cream. I saw few barns or yards where there was a load of manure In sight. Go into their large barns and you will find a bin where all the manure is kept until put on the land. Those who keep no stock have to put from 800 to 1,000 pounds of fertlllier on e«»ch acre each year before they plant their crop. They would no more think of trying to raise a crop without it than they would to draw a check on a bank where they had no cash. Mr. Farmer, are you taking care of your manure? You had better, for each load of it is just so much cash. Secretary Wilson says there are 12,000 abandoned farms In New York state today where all the soil is either washed off or its productivity gone. But Nebraska will never come to that. Today science is in the saddle. Our agricultural colleges are turning out an army of scientifically edu - cated students who study the soil as a minister studies his Bible, or an attorney or a doctor studies his books. In my judgment the best assets </seg>
            <seg id="p381">Ely country can acquire is to scatter these agricultural scientists ir lands. They will prove to be lighthouses on the hills helping orant to keep off the rocks. Some of the old mossbacks may smile, ry will watcn as eagerly for pointers as a cat does for a mouse. Alfalfa. I christen it the farmer's soil saver. A man who owns alfalfa land has a mine of gold or better, for a gold mine can be dug dry, but an alfalfa mine never. Two and tnree hundred dollars per acre will not be too high for well preserved Nebraska land in the near future. With proper farming it will pay good dividends on those prices. The world must stop finding gold in such quantities, or good land will continue to rise, for as the precious metals increase and the dollar gets cheaper, so will real estate increase. We dug more gold in 1908 than any year In the world's history, nearly one-half billion. .More in twenty-five years Just passed than in all previous years, and It is predicted by those best able to judge that the next twenty years will double the amount of gold now on hand. So. Mr. Farmer, keep your land rich and reap your reward. Just a word more and I am through. Is your wife, daughter, or mother with you this week? If not, why not? Would not they enjoy this hunt after new ideas to help in your business? Try and bring them next time. Woman's lot is a hard one. Think how they suffered that we might come into existence. "Men may work from sun till sun. but a woman's work is never done." The perpetuity of the institutions of this country lies in the fact that the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world. Now if you were like Solomon of old and had 960 wives to bring with you and buy Easter hats for, you would be excusable for leaving them all at home, for ii would be wrong to be partial, but as you have only one you ought to be able to give her a pretty good time. Some one has said that a man may work from 6:00 a.m. each day of the year, but if so, some woman has to work from 5:00 a.m. that he may have his breakfast prepared and get ready for his day's work. A man may work each day till 7:00 p.m., but if he does, some poor woman has to work till 8:00 p.m. that he may have his supper prepared and things gotten ready for the next morning meal. .My fellow men, try and make it from now on a little easier for your wives, mothers, and daughters. When you are leaving on trips like this ask them if possible to get ready and go too and their happy smile will repay you lor any sacrifices you may have to make in order to do it. WHEN TO SOW ALFALFA. By E. W. Hunt. K determining this matter one must take into account the different tions that prevail in different parts of the state, and adopt the &gt;d that under the prevailing conditions of soil and climate will offer &lt;ast resistance to the vigorous growth during the first season of the ; and tender plant. For it must always be borne in mind that the </seg>
            <seg id="p382">young alfalfa plant is very tender, has very little power of resistance, and quickly succumbs to conditions which almost any other plant would eas - ily survive. When once firmly established it is very hardy and if un - pastured is usually able to take care of itself, but when young It must be given every possible advantage, must be protected as far as may be from adverse conditions of soil and ciimate, and must have ample assistance in its battle with the weeds. As related to the proper time for sowing alfalfa, the state may be roughly divided into two districts. The first district comprises the high - rolling glaciated part of the state, and the loess plains to the rest of it If a line be drawn through Seward to a point about six miles west of Crete and extended till it touches the state line both north and south, all east of this line is known as the glaciated part of the state. Here the soil in general is different from that found in any other part of the state. The different kinds of soil seem to have been mixed with each other by the action of the glacier, and glacial clay is frequently in evidence. To the west of this district lies the loess region. Generally speaking, it extends south from the sand-hill district and west to the rough, canyon country which marks the transition to the high table-land, or elevated plateau. North Platte is situated near the northwestern limit of a loess peninsula that reaches northwest from the broad loess plains. The soil in the loess region is more homogeneous than in the glaciated part of the state, and the subsoil is generally of great depth and of the same nature throughout. Throughout this first district the various weeds are the principal fac - tora to be reckoned with in trying to get a good stand of alfalfa. Over most of this district crab grass has become a dangerous enemy, foxtail is abundant and voracious of plant food and other weeds in the early part of the season "take" fields that are not Kept in constant cultivation. Here it is better to delay sowing alfalfa till the season of rank weed growth is over and especially till the crab-grass season is closed. From the first to the tenth of August is the most favorable time. There have been in - stances where alfalfa sown later than this, sown as late as October, has survived the following winter, which happened to be mild and favorable. But any one who sows later than the tenth of August always takes a chance, and the later the sowing the more desperate the chance. Since the getting of a good stand of alfalfa is always an expensive matter, only those who can afford to do so should take any more chances than neces - sary. The surest mean:; to get a good stand even at this time is to keep the ground in thorough cultivation from the opening of tne season till the time for sowing, conserving the moisture and killing the weeds. Some fanners object to losing the use of the ground for one season, and wish to take a crop of small grain off before seeding to alfalfa. When this Is attempted there is only one way in which it can be done with reasonable chances of success. It may usually be accomplished in favorable seasons by the following method: Run a sharp disk immediately behind the binder so that the bundle carrier will drop the bundles on the disked ground. Remove the shocks as soon as they are dry enough to go into a </seg>
            <seg id="p383">BThe disking of the ground prevents evaporation from the surface, a few days the moisture drawn from below by capillary attraction ive softened the ground so that a plow will work well. There will deep crust, and consequently no large clods to be thrown up by Um Put a horse on the plowed ground fastened to the furrow horse . jockey stick, and attach to it one section of a harrow. I his way every furrow slice will be tramped by the horse and at the time harrowed five times. This will not only fine the ground, but Iso prevent the loss of moisture and the formation and hardening ill clods, and put the ground in fine condition for a seed bed. Un - ime such method as this is adopted it is hazardous business attempt - get a good stand of alfalfa after removing a crop of small grain. The second district comprises the sand-hill region and the elevated plateau and occupies the northwestern part of the state. It lies north and west of the first district. Here the chief obstacles to getting a good stand are the high winds and the burning sun of the late summer months. All soils in this district contain more or less sand. When the wind blows these fine particles of sand drift and cut off the tender shoots of the young plant. Even in those places where the soil does not drift, the whipping of the young plant back and forth by the wind is almost as fatal to it To avoid this difficulty it is best to delay sowing till the season of high winds is past, which generally is the case from the first to the tenth of June. Until this time the ground should be kept in good cultivation to prevent the loss of moisture and the growth of weeds. The best tool for this cultivation is the disk, as that leaves the ground a little rough, and the soil will not drift on rough ground as badly as if the ground were smoothed by a harrow. By sowing at this time the young plant gets the advantage of the summer rains, which are generally frequent during June and july, and is thus enabled to get a deep root hold on the soil. This will enable it generally to endure the hard conditions of the ordinary August and the high, dry winds of the late fall and early winter. Alfalfa sown here as late as is advised for the first district, owing to the greater elevation and the consequent shorter season, is not likely to secure a growth vigorous enough and a root hold deep enough to enable it to with - stand successfully these adverse conditions. For these reasons neither fall nor summer sowing is advised for either the sand-hill region or the elevated plateau. To assist the young plant to withstand the August sun it is best to af - ford it a little shade. For this purpose it is advised to drill In not more than a quarter of a stand of some small grain, preferably oats or barley, and then sow the alfalfa broadcast at the rate of twenty pounds to the acre and cover lightly with a harrow. It is better in broadcasting to put on ten pounds going one way and then cross the field putting on the other ten pounds. In this way an even stand is secured and all blank spaces avoided. When the growing small grain begins to joint run a mower over it not less than four inches from the ground and repeat as often as it be - gins to joint again. This will prevent excessive use of moisture by the </seg>
            <seg id="p384">grain and will leave more for the alfalfa. What moisture the alfalfa loses by the growth of the small grain is more than compensated for by the protection it receives from sun and wind and drifting soil. Winter kills the small grain and its dead foliage makes a protecting mulch for the al - falfa against drying wind and frost and catches and holds a coverlet of snow in winter, the moisture of which will quickly start growth in the following spring. One other suggestion, sow enough seed, — twenty pounds to the acre. Some persons figure it out that when sown at the rate of twelve pounds to the acre, if all the seeds grow, there will be so many, giving the num - ber, plants to the square foot. But the seeds do not all of them grow. No matter how thickly or how thinly sown, the stand always becomes thinner year by year. To secure a good stand that will remain thick enough to be profitable for a long period, enough seed must be sown. All seed should be tested for germinating power. To get a good £tand is at best an expensive matter, and it is poor economy to try to economize in the amount of seed to be sown. In the northwest the seed used is gen - erally home grown. The methods of handling the crop have been so crude that the mature 6eed has been shattered off, leaving on me straw only such as was green enough to be tough. Much of this would not germi - nate. The result has generally been a poor stand, simply through failure to sow enough germinable seed. The reputation of alfalfa has suffered FALL PLOWING By E. W. Hunt. This is a matter that is receiving altogether too little attention from the farmers of the state. The probable reason for this neglect is to be found in the fact that farms are so managed and the farm work so ar - ranged that time is lacking for this most necessary and productive work. On most farms as soon as harvest is over, shock threshing begins. The ordinary farmer gets his labor for threshing by "changing work" with his neighbors. The equipment tor shock tnreshing is much larger, re - quires more men and more teams than lor stack threshing. The labor that the farmer receives from his neighbors he must pay back In kind and at the time his neighbors demand it. This takes time when it is mo^t imperatively demanded at home. By the time that threshing is over, al - falfa must generally be cut. and wild hay made. Then comes potato har - vest, and then corn harvest. Necessary work keeps pushing all the time, so that fall plowing seems to be out of the question. The remedy for this state of affairs lies in a change in farm management. Shock threshing should speedily become a thing ot tbe past. It is too wasteful and too expensive to be longer tolerated. It demands a maximum of labor at a time when it is most needed on the home farm. Grain may be stacked and threshed with far less labor and more of it saved for the grain bin than by the method now In vogue. A light covering with slough hay or </seg>
            <seg id="p385">■ • or wild hay will protect the stack from the weather if they are 1 built. The threshing may then be postponed till after the fall j is done and labor may easily be had. Kin inducement to farmers to make the change in management above ited and as encouragement to them to undertake a work that is too neglected on nearly every farm, we shall here set forth some of the ts to be derived by plowing in the fall, and by plowing as deeply a* le with the ordinary farm equipment. In the first place it will add to the fertility of the soil. All soils jon - mineral salts that are or may become the bases from which plant food may be made. These mineral salts in the form in which they orig - inally exist in the soil are not immediately available for plant food. They first be oxidized. To illustrate, potassium is not a plant food, but h an oxidized product of potassium is a plant food. Exposure to the action of the oxygen of the air and to the effect of the various atmospheric influences oxidizes these mineral salts and converts them into plant food, thus adding to the fertility of the soil. On old worn soils the effect of deep plowing is readily to be seen in the first crop. On these the mineral &gt;alts contained in the ordinary furrow slice obtained in shallow plowing have nearly all been oxidized and made available and used up. so that the &gt;u\\ seems to be exhausted. But drop the plow deeper, turn out to the a of the elements soil that has never been before disturbed, and new plant food is made available, equivalent to the application of so much chemical fertilizer. It is better and cheaper to dig up the fertilizer with plow than to buy it at enhanced prices in the general market In the second place deep fall plowing creates a water holding reservoir in the soil and prevents wash. Wnenever water runs on the soil it is at the expense of fertility. The plant food in the soil is very soluble, and is readily taken up and carried off by running water. If the soil is handled in such a way as to prevent water from running, this soluble plant food is retained in the soil, and its fertility is increased instead of depleted. If the soil is loosened to a depth of two inches those two inches will hold a certain amount of water without losing any. If, however, the soil is loosened to a depth of six inches, it will hold three times as much without losing any. This will be sufficient to retain all the water except from the most violent storms. Retaining the water in the soil retains the fertility too. Another reason for retaining all the water possible in the soil Is found in the fact that plants take all their food in solution. The plant food must first be dissolved in water and this water sucked up by the feeder rootlets of the plant before it can be built into plant tissues. If there is not water enough in the soil to dissolve the plant food, the plant will slowly starve to death. This is what happens in many cases where farm - ers say their corn is "firing." There is not sufficient water in the soil to dissolve the plant food and the plant is beginning to starve for lark of food. This trouble may in most cases be obviated by creating a water - holding reservoir in the soil of sufficient depth to hold the necessary water. Deep fall plowing affords the best means of doing this, for by 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p386">this means the moisture from the fall, winter, and spring rains and snows may be stored up in the soil, ready for use when the proper time and need Another reason for tall plowing is found in the fact that it distributes the work more evenly over the different seasons, leaving more time in each for really productive work. If a part of the work on the farm can be done the preceding season the spring work will not be so badly rushed. The man who does a good share of his spring work during the preceding fall will have time for adequate and proper work in the spring. Tl. especially desirable if the opening season should prove to be cold and backward. Plowed ground warms more quickly than the undisturbed soil and comes sooner into condition favorable for growth. Two objections to fall plowing remain to be considered. The first one is that in many cases it is impossible on account of the condition of the soil. After the small grain crop is removed the ground in most sections of the state bakes so hard that plowing becomes impossible. This dim &lt;ulty may be entirely obviated by thoroughly disking the ground a week or ten days before attempting to plow. Breaking the surface with a disk the rapid evaporation from the surface, so that the moisture from below comes up and softens the crust, prevents the formation of large clods, and furnishes moisture enough so that the plow works better than at almost any other season of the year. Another objection urged by many is that fall plowed land drifts badly with the winter and spring winds. On some fields the land has been btripped bare of all the soil that had been loosened. This has happened in most cases where very shallow plowing had been done. This danger may be prevented in most cases by leaving the plowed ground as rough as possible. Any harrowing or smoothing should be avoided. This rough ground has the added advantage of being able to receive and hold the moisture from melting snow and rain even while it is frozen. The water will enter the openings and be retained there instead of running off the surface. In some sections of the state where the soil is sandy and espe - cially liable to drift, the drifting may be prevented and most of the ad - vantages of fall plowing be secured by listing deeply in a direction at right angles to the direction of the prevailing wind, and then eplitting the ridges just as deeply. This is what is called "double listing" in some puts of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p387">ALFALFA. By W. R. Mellor. ■ s no easy matter when discussing any farm subject to coach It in language as to apply to the whole state of Nebraska, which has such a great variety of soil and climatic conditions, with difference of altitude and rainfall in the eastern and western parts of the state that the proper application in one section of the state dies not, oftentimes, produce satis- n&lt; tory results in another Efa is last becoming one of the valuable crops of our state. Many that it solves the problem for the maintenance of a dense popu - in the future Nebraska, as the conditions of its growth are here By consulting the report of the Bureau of Statistics we find that al number of tons grown in 1904 was 744,420, which in 1908 was increased to 1,846.703, or more than 248 per cent. Mr. Hull says: It is no longer necessary to argue the question with the Nebraska farmer aa to the feeding value of alfalfa, for its merits in this regard are admitted by all. Neither will it be necessary to use any argument with the up-to - date farmer in convincing him of the value of this crop in helping to maintain the fertility of the soil, as nearly every community in which alfalfa has been grown for any length of time has furnished a practical demonstration of the value of raising potatoes or corn following the plow - ing under of the alfalfa. Both of these questions have been so thoroughly settled in the school of actual experience that no argument will make the proof stronger. The only question, then, to be settled is. How can we in the easiest and surest way come in possession of this valuable plant? First in importance is the procuring of good home-grown seed. We do not hesitate to say that more farmers have been discouraged and deterred from growing alfalfa from having sown seed grown in Utah or New Mex - ico or some place too far south and where it was grown under irrigation. This seed looks much finer than the home grown and will grow all right, but the first winter will kill a large per cent of It. Then, if the experi - ment is being tried in a section where alfalfa is little grown, the man is ready to blame it to his soil or climatic conditions or anything but the real cause, which was seed unacclimated. The time of seeding will depend on the part of the state you lire in. From the center of the state west we would advise spring seeding as a general proposition and in the eastern half fall seeding. If spring Mad - ing is desired, then we should prefer that the land should have been in corn the previous year and well tended. Then commence in the spring as soon as the ground is in condition to work well and thoroughly disk the land, lapping the disk one-half. Then as often as it rains and packs the ground, or if the weeds start, either harrow or disk again. Keep up this cultivation until the first to fifteenth of June. You will by this means have sprouted and destroyed a large part of the weeds and conserved the moisture and prepared the land in fine physical condition to receive the </seg>
            <seg id="p388">feed. Sow twenty pounds per acre. The seed may be sown with a broadcast seeder, by hand, or may be drilled in. Whatever the method, extreme care should be exercised to distribute the seed evenly and not to cover it too deeply. One objection in using the drill is that the seed t usually put in too deep and comes up poorly. The wheelbarrow grass ;der is one of the best implements for the purpose. Thoroughly harrow, and you will have no more trouble to get a stand of alfalfa than of wheat or oats. If fall seeding is desired, then the land should be sown to small grain the year you intend to seed to alfalfa. When cutting the grain you should follow the harvester with the disk, as this will conserve the moisture and put the land in shape to plow later on. We do not think it best to plow very deep, but thoroughly turn and pulverize the soil. This can be done by using an extra horse in your team, attaching one section of the harrow behind the plow, which harrows each furrow two or three times, fining and firming the soil, leaving it in excellent condition for seeding. Some farmers say not to be in a hurry and seed unless there is plenty of mois - ture, but we believe it advisable to sow and harrow at once, not waiting for moisture, for when the seed is properly in the ground it will come up after the first rain. Try to sow in August. Seeding after September 1st will not make as vigorous a growth during the fall as the earlier seeding and is more apt to be winter killed and is likely to keep you home from the State Fair. In spring-sown alfalfa it is usually necessary to mow the weeds once or twice the first year. In doing so be careful not to set the sickle bar too low, but leave some of the leaves on the plant or you will kill a num - ber of the plants. Kght top dressing of well rotted stable manure, about ten loads per will be a great factor in aiding to start alfalfa; in fact we would ;ly urge that all land to be sown to alfalfa be well manured prior preparation. Alfalfa should be cut as soon as the first bloom begins to appear, for at that stage there is less woody fiber to the stem, hence less waste. The greatest difficulty in eastern Nebraska in the handling of alfalfa, when nit. is to get it up without discoloring. A method of handling the crop which has given good satisfaction to a number of our farmers is to cut the alfalfa in the morning as soon as the dew is off, allow it to remain in the swath as late in the afternoon as possible and yet get It raked before the evening dews fall, and then put it in tall cocks if it looks like rain, otherwise leave it in the windrow over night. If the next day is sun - shiny, the hay is scattered after the dew is off, allowed to dry until late afternoon, and put in stack or barn. This method of handling insures a B, green color so desirable in the merchantable article. Care must ercised, however, as hay put in the barn or stack when only par - cured is likely to mould or char and be dusty so as to make it prac- tically unsalable and in some cases sufficient heat is generated to ignite. Immediately after taking the hay from the field thoroughly disk tfc* </seg>
            <seg id="p389">field with a barrow tooth disk if you have or can get one, and If not, with an ordinary disk well weighted and set nearly straight. This will give the ground a cultivation, kill weeds, sandburs. and grass and not injure alfalfa If more than one year old. Do not cultivate the first year. tthe second crop for seed. The fields in western Nebraska are vorably located for a seed crop and oftentimes such a crop is very ile. We do not think it profitable to pasture alfalfa except with When hogs are pastured feed but a very small ration of grain twice Do not feed work horses too much. However, a limited feed of is good for them. If a horse is given all he will eat he will eat ph. but there is no better hay to feed to young colts or milch cows. </seg>
