            <seg id="p017">17 but in these counties probation officers have been appointee who have baen zealous in the performance of their duties and the results accomplished far exceeded the most sanguine expectations. In Douglas County they are fully organize under the law, having established a Detention Home o School. Consideration there has been given to about 2,000 cases, and in Lancaster County to nearly 400. Many of th juvenile offenders were paroled to their own homes, requir ing them to report at least once a week until discharged by the court. This course not only awakens the parents to their ;&gt;onsibility but tends to stimulate the child to better de - portment. At Omaha where they have established the Detention School or Home, 225 have been enrolled, and. under the care of noble women, many have received their first impression of what constituted a well regulated home. One of our able judges who presides over this branch of the court says: "I consider the juvenile court law the most important measure ever enacted, the children who come di - rectly under its care are only a handful compared with those who have been restrained from wrong, and influence for right by its direct influences." And from his experience with the results of the adult delinquency section, he says "By placing the responsibility where it belongs we have bet - ter homes, better parents and a general awakening of the people in the methods of dealing with adults." From the reports received on blanks mailed to county officers and from information secured by the chief clerk in visiting county jails and poor houses, we find that during the past year about 400 persons were maintained at poor farms. r 700 persons received out-door relief, making a total of over 1100 persons who have received aid from the count at an expense of nearly $60,000. This amount would be much greater if it were not that in many of the counties the surplus revenue from the poor farm more than equals the amount paid out for out-door relief.
