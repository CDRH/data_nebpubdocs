PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS Mr. Chairman, Members of the State Board of Agriculture, Ladies and Gentlemen: Following a usual custom, it becomes my duty at this time to give you a summary of activities for the past year. 1938 was a disappointing year in the way of srops, and crops always go a long way toward assisting in a good Fair. Failure of crops in our State for the past four years has lowered the spending power of our farmers, not only in the purchase of the necessities of life, hut also in the patronage of Fairs; for the farmer is the indivi - dual most concerned in agricultural exhibits and in Fairs in general. Our farmers and tax payers have been sorely distressed and the Legislature unable to allow appropriations in keeping of and main - taining the property on the Fair Grounds. However, the Board of </seg>
         <seg id="p013">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATS BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Managers has endeavored to apply their best efforts in trying to solve the problem in the best way possible, and has succeeded in coming through 1938 NO DEFICIT and all bills paid. Some criticism has been heaped upon the heads of the Board of Managers, by persons not informed, as to the management and the handling of State Fairs. This in most cases comes from disgruntled persons and disappointed exhibitors, and in a great many cases from individuals who know nothing as to the handling the affairs of a Fair, but assume an air of criticism without any just cause. Criticism has been made that the Board is an institution that perpetuates it - self in office. Nothing can be farther from the truth. -I might call your attention to the fact that in the past ten years, on the Board of twenty-nine members, at least 19 of them have changed in that time. . The idea of Robert Furnas and others with him who wore in - terested in the set up of the Nebraska Board of Managers, was that, as the Board of Managers were set up from the twenty-nine members that those selected would have had experience in Fair matters and management when placed on the Board. At this time I would like to quote from Secretary Reed's report in 1936 as to classes of Fairs: •¦There are two classes of state fairs in the United States today. A large majority of the fairs, ours included, are run by organizations which were created by statute and interlocked with the county fairs, allowing the county fairs to have a voice in the naming of members oE the organization. These members are chosen for .their successful work with their county fairs and interest in civic affairs,- public spirited citizens that are willing to devote time and energy to the public good. Many of these organizations were formed like our own when the states were new and sponsored by such men as J. Sterling Morton, Samuel Bassett, Robert W. Furnas and a long list of pioneers and prominent citizens who devoted much of their time and thought to the agricultural interests of their state. But the last few years some of the states have done away with these organizations, such as Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Dakota, and have put the appointment of a manager in the hands of the governor. This not only divorces the county fairs from the state fair v.ork, but makes it a political proposition and when there is a change in governors, a change in managers.". The representation under which Nebraska and other states are organized, has been the most economical and best managed of any of the states. The Board of Agriculture is the parent of all county fairs and represents the sentiment of the County Fairs regardless of unjust criticism heaped upon them. </seg>
         <seg id="p014">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ADMISSIONS The majority of fairs in this state and other states as well, have in the past years over-reached their resources to meet the demands of their patrons, and one of the demands confronting the manage - ment Is to meet that demand on a fifty cent admission. Let me cite you present conditions. A patron pays at the gate an admission of fifty cents. He has access to all the exhibits on the grounds, goes to the full afternoon program at a charge of twenty-five cents —good com - fortable seats, under cover—sees the program, returns for the even - ing show at twenty-five cents sees the evening program, and for all this day and evening entertainment he has spent but $1.00. Where can he spend that amount of money getting the full benefit of all the educational and agricultural ideas that are on the grounds. He cannot attend any other Pair in the United States and get what he does at the Nebraska State Fair for the money. Some of our critics contend that our attendance has fallen off in the past three years, let us see. In 1929 the attendance figures giver, out were 437,660, the charge that year was fifty cents for adults and fifty cents for cars, there were 49,537 cars. The finan - cial report for that year shows $84,471 for general admissions and turnstiles. This would sliow, without counting the automobiles, that only 168,942 people paid to get in or 270,440 did not pay. In 1930 the attendance figures were 439,382 and the total for admissions was ?75,387, which would show only 150,774 paid and 286,886 did not pay. This difference in figures showing 28,6,886 that did not pay can be accounted for in the following manner. At that time we issued a season ticket that was good to go in and out of the gates as many times in the day as they wanted to, but we found this privilege was abused. The actual number entering were counted, but of course these people going in and out of the gates during the day, some of them possibly were counted a number of times. That is why the attendance figures were so large, it was not a case of passes being issued, but it was simply that the system was at fault. In recent years our attendance figures merely show the number of paid admissions, in 1938 the paid admissions were 77,419. IMPROVEMENTS In the past year important improvements and changes have been made on the Grounds. A great portion of this aid has come through WPA assistance given us, all of which we greatly appreciate. Three thousand trees have been planted and are growing nicely. Shrubbery planted and a general landscaping plan laid out. Survey made to level grounds, grades reduced, and fills made where needed. The </seg>
         <seg id="p015">REPORT OE NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE old check room and telephone building razed and a new building in its place. Vast improvements made to roofs, and to the live stock pavHlion. Horse barns, a suitable feed and foarage building erected, unsightly buildings removed and revamped in general. The old Mercantile Hall, which was the oldest building on the grounds, razed and the material salvaged. The ground on which it was located leveled some four feet and dirt consisting of thousands of yards moved on to the low land north end of the carnival grounds, making a vast improvement and putting the street down to grade. A new entrance was built to the carnival grounds to make the setting in harmony with the surroundings. The south fence along the Burlington railroad built entirely new. This accomplished through the aid of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. In fact all improvements have been carried out with the idea of a proper setting for the future development. ¦-¦. : '.'¦•¦ '¦•' EXHIBITS ¦•'.¦¦¦ " ' The exhibits in all departments; were the largest in years. In - crease in live stock—horses, sheep and hogs far above the previous years. Our exhibit of horses overflowed the barns; sheep at least 60% increase, and a large healthy increase in the exhibit of hogs. Also poultry made a fine showing in the increase over 1937-1936. Agriculture—The display of agriculture was larger and better. The Agricultural Hall had the best display that has ever been put on before. It exceeded the expectation of the Board in every respect and was far ahead of any exhibits of like nature in our sister states. This under the most adverse condition ever confronting our State. Machinery—The machinery exhibit at the Nebraska. State Fair, not only in my opinion but.the opinion of those viewing it, was the largest and best ever exhibited on the grounds. Not only the farmer, but all citizens of our State are always interested in the display of machinery. In fact all of us like to see the wheels go round. 4-H caub—This class has been constantly growing and the dis - play, not only of live stock but in other lines, was beyond expecta - tions. This class and work given encouragement will continue to make progress and is a great educational feature as well as a fine work to entourage for good citizens and future Agriculture In Ne - braska. RECOMMENDATIONS With the coming of fast automobiles and Improved highways makes the distance between points short. Realizing that with these </seg>
         <seg id="p016">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we will not have the use for the large camp grounds as in previous years, I would recommend that the land lying east of Antelope Creek be used for parking, and that the west fence of the present fair grounds proper be moved west to or near Antelope Creek for this needed parking space. Electric Lines—The present high tension lines now entering the grounds are too widely scattered and are unsatisfactory, causing a heavy upkeep. I would recommend that the suggestion of the Sup - erintendent of Grounds be followed and the main or trunk line enter the grounds from the west at a point near the center and run east thereby making it possible to distribute current from this one line to all parts of the grounds. This will be economy in the way of material and save a vast amount o{ labor and give more satisfactory service. Textile Building—lf WPA labor is available or the Legislature provides funds, would recommend that the Textile Building be re - moved and rebuilt northwest of the present location. The building will soon need repairing if it remains in the present location. If WPA labor is available, this in my estimation can be done by match - ing the material salvaged against WPA labor with but very little outlay of money. This building extends over across part of the street line and is an obstruction of the Agricultural Hall. In a few years, if this is not done, a large amount must be spent for repair, and as the building is now arranged it is not suitable for a Textile exhibit. Pony Hams —The present Pony Barns are not in the best loca - tion and if possible, and funds could be available, should be torn down and rebuilt in a more suitable location. If these were re - moved it would be possible to construct an exit to fourteenth street, thereby relieving seventeenth street of a great deal of outgoing traffic. Farm Products Department—There was inserted in the premium list in 1938 the following: "The State Fair reserves the right of submitting any or all exhibits to the germination test, and any ex - hibit showing a germination test lower than 80 will forfeit its plac - ing to the sample below it of 80 or above test. The Fair further - more reserves the privilege of defacing any exhibits that are barred from further fairs, be the germination good or inferior." The reason for this was that exhibitors have been showing the same seeds or grains, year after year, and taking the premiums. This is not fair and does not give the new exhibitor a fair chance. Test shown on quite a number of these exhibits in 1938 show below tests as low as zero. For some reason unknown to me, this rule </seg>
         <seg id="p017">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE was not strictly enforced as it should have been. I recommend to the Board of Managers for 1939 that this rule be strictly enforced. Counting Automobiles—Another thing that I would recommend to the Board is that a counting be made of the automobiles entering the grounds, recording the numbers of the counties from which they come for the purpose of getting information as to where our patron - age comes, if from the counties close or far. This tally would show to the advantage of being able to advertise possibly a little more thoroughly in counties where the patronage was actually coming from. While in Chicago, this subject was discussed and different speakers commented on the benefits received from knowing about what part of the State they got their heavy patronage. In this way the Secretary would be able to check up, or possibly In sending out advertising matter it could be sent direct to the Individuals in these sections. Or not a bad idea is to send a questionnaire to those people asking what improvements they suggest in the way of exhibits en - tertainment, etc., which would give the Board an Idea as to what their patrons were thinking of. Much has been said about pari-mutuels in connection with the races at the Fair. One would think from the expression of some, that Nebraska was the only State Fair that used them. There are about seventeen states using them. The running races with the mutuels have not only provided an attraction in front of the grand - stand which has paid for itself, but the profit from them has kept the Fair out of the red the past four years, which I think the financial statement of the three years before we had them compared with the years since will show: 39 3 2-19 3 4—Without pari-mutuels 1935 to 1938—With parl-mutuels General Grandstand State Appropriation Year Admissions Day For State Fair Amount of Deficit 1932 $26,506.15 $ 6,920.75 $ 44,000.00 $39,428.59—N0tes *1933 28,186.50 7,501.25 33,956.00 12,582.05—40% not paid 1934 25,700.33 4,229.50 24,838.00 ; 2,966.00—40% not paid $80,392.98 118,651.50 $102^9X00" $54,976.64 *1933—Mr. Reed's first year as Secretary General Grandstand State Appropriation Expended for Year Admission Day For State Fair Maintenance 1935 ? 36,532.60 $10,004.50 $ 24,050.00 $ 26,74128 1936 39.375.50 13,033.75 24,050.00 31,756 37 1937 40.627.20 11,642.00 29,050.00 34,940.13 . $116,535.30 $34,680.25 $77,150.00 $' 93,437 78 1938 39,628.24 12,683.50 24,500.00 32,916.99 $156,163.54 $47,363.75 $101,650.00 •$126,354.77' </seg>
         <seg id="p018">REi'UHT OF XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938 all bills paid in full and in addition $24,704.77 more expended for maintenance than the entire amount appropriated by the State. This substantial profit of the Fair went back into the grounds for buildings, labor and maintenance above the appropriation. Also, $7,654.48 was paid on bills contracted in 1931 and 1932. We have turned over to the First Trust Company for the grandstand debenture bonds, our grandstand receipts totaling $58, 084.47 for the past four years. In closing I wish to briefly review some of the improvements and changes that have taken place during my twenty-nine years on this Board of Agriculture. The following buildings have been built: Sheep Barn, Hog Barn, Cattle Barn, Poultry Barn, Women's Build - ing, Automobile Building, Grandstand, 4-H Club Building and many other lesser buildings, not that I am taking any credit for them, but have seen them come. During that time and the time that I have been on the Board of Managers, I have seen many Fairs come and go on the general make up of the Nebraska State Board of Agri - culture. I have enjoyed the acquaintance and the fellowship of a fine and progressive bunch of men, all vitally interested in the advancement of Agriculture. I wish to thank each and everyone for the fine cooperation given me as a member of the Board of Managers and as an individual co-worker. I sincerely hope that my service on the Board has re - sulted in something that will be of benefit to my friends and my State. I shall continue to be with you in this work for another year.

Motion seconded by Mr. R. R. Vance, Adams County and upon being put to vote, declared carried by the chair. WHEREUPON PRESIDENT BANNING RETURNS TO THE CHAIR. MR. BAILEY, Thayer County: Mr. President: I wish at this time to interrupt the order of business. As a member of the creden - tials committee. Banner County's financial report has not to date been received, however, Banner County has paid their dues as a member of the County Fairs Association, and they have a very good fair in Banner County. They have an outstanding man representing them from the western part of the state; so, Mr. President, I move at this time that the rules be suspended, and Mr. Lester Van Pelt be seated as the representative of Banner County. </seg>
         <seg id="p019">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. VANCE: I second the motion. UPON BEING PUT TO VOTE THE MOTION WAS DECLARED CARRIED BY THE CHAIR. PRESIDENT BANNING: We will next have the secretary's report. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY The State Board of Agriculture is about to close its eightieth year as an organization. The first ten years of which was under a Territorial Board created by the Legislature of 1858, the last seventy as a State Board. It would require an untold amount of time to report in detail all the accomplishments of this organization or to name the many outstanding individuals that have been identified with this Board and that have helped to mold the history of our state. It is a matter of history that this Board was created by the Legislature as the parent organization for the numerous societies and associations which are now devoting themselves to the several branches of our basic industry, Agriculture. In the case of State vs. Otoe County Agricultural Association carried to the Supreme Court in 1928, the Court has this to say, "The State Board of Agriculture stm remains the ultimate controlling agency, which, in addition to supervising the holding of the State Fair, gathers information, makes reports and functions as contemplated by the original act and the county agricultural societies still retain the descriptive designation, •subordinate society 1 and are required to make their stated reports and carry on in the same subordinate capacity that was contemplated in the original act of the Legislature." It was also, in fact, a sta - tutory safe guard provided for the benefit of the taxpayer. Under its terms public moneys devoted to this public purpose were required to be expended "agreeable to rules and regulations prescribed by a disinterested; public agency, the State Board of Agriculture." Fur - ther on in this decision the Court says, "The statute of this State in express terms makes the County Agricultural Societies 'subordin - ate' to but one governmental agency, viz. the State Board of Agri - culture, and when the subordinate society .has complied with, the rules set down by the State Board, the chief officer of such subor - dinate society was in terms made an ex-offido member at the annual meeting." So it will be seen that there is an important connection between the State and County Fairs. County Fairs are not only a valuable and ever Increasing asset to the particular community in which it is held, but also the county fairs may be termed as feeders for the State Fair. There is the open forum at the county fairs for the battle between those who wish to compete at the State Fair, here occurs the elimination con- </seg>
         <seg id="p020">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tests. Those that can stand the acid test at the county fairs are in turn sent off to the State Fair for the final test. Here it is that the more prosperous and aggressive exhibitors, boys and girls clubs, and patrons become fair enthusiasts and boosters, they receive the stimulus and incentive that later sends them on to the State Fair as patrons and exhibitors there. The State Fair of today Is as much as it ever was a great stimulus to agricultural endeavor. It still makes for progress by comparison of what this man or that man has done as against the achievement of someone else. It has been fig - ure.! that approximately eighty per cent of what we learn comes to us through the eye, or what we learn is eighty per cent visual ed - ucation. That is the real reason why the Fair is so valuable as an educational institution. It deals not in theory but in object lessons. Every Fair as it presents the actual article or animal for compar - ison and study gives an implied challenge to anyone else to produce as good or better if he can. When Fairs were first founded, travel or transportation was antiquated, and communication was primitive and slow. Chiefly be - cause of these handicaps of a growing civilization the early Fair enjoyed a much more distinctive niche in the progress of that civili - zation than does the Fair of today. Fairs and expositions always have been and always will be clearing houses of ideas, presenting a clear exposition of state or national progress and achievement, they make valuable contact —not only between urban, rural and indus - trial but between the various businesses and professions as well. The early fairs were perhaps a necessity because of the lack of transportation or communication facilities as we know them today, but why does the Fair exist today? Because it occupies a distinctly valuable place in the field of agricultural education. In the United States as a whole, more than 4,000 separate institutions attest to the faith of the American people in the county, independent and state fairs, and despite the occasional observation by some that the day of the fair is past, they still hold a commanding place in the educational and entertainment field. New methods of commun - ication and travel have changed the scene considerably and ou.r contacts are much more varied and frequent than they used to be in the years when we looked to driving to the fair in the buggy or goini; on an excursion train for the high spots of the year in the way of instruction and amusement. Agriculture is the foundation of any nation and any civilization. The economic and social structure of this country is dependent on the welfare of agricultural pursuit. The laborer, teacher mechanic Bud scientist all have to be fed and clothed. Only after successful agriculture are all other lines of endeavor prosperous. Agricul - ture in this State has experienced a very severe set back In the past few years. With the severe drouth extending over a number of </seg>

Many farms throughout the State have scarcely any live stock where formerly there were fine herds of purebred stock, many of them being exhibited at the State Fair, men on account of adversity have lost much of their enthusi - asm and^ like many other classes of people, do not have the money to attend the State Pair.

The 4-H Baby Beef Sale was much better than last year, much credit must be given the Lincoln Junior Chamber of Commerce for their promotional work to make the sale a success. The grand champion sold at 80&lt;? a pound compared to 52tf in 1937 and the reserve champion 27%(} compared to 25&lt;Tin 1937. The 166 head sold at nn average price of $12.90 per hundred. T.hese figures show that there were 357 exhibitors in live stock and poultry departments in 1938 and 265 in 1937, or 92 more in 1938 than 1937; with 14,351 entries of other classes in 1938 com - pared with 12,285 in 1937, or an increase of 2,066. We have been criticized by some, that our premiums are not what they should be. The Board has felt that we should offer what we can afford to pay. Some compare our premiums with lowa—in 1938 the lowa Fair had a balance of $46,227.57, the Legislature gave them $50,000 for maintenance, $10,000 for premiums and $70,000 for buildings to match up with WPA. Our total appropriation from the State for our own use was $24,500 and we must turn over our grandstand receipts to the bondholders, while lowa has the use of theirs. Our premiums compare favorably with the live stock classes as the following will show. In the draft horses, beef cattle, swine and sheep the premium offering for Nebraska State Fair totals $10 671.00—Oklahoma State Fair, $9,848.00; Kansas State Pair, Hutch- Inson, $9,639.00; Kansas Free Fair, Topeka, $6,828.00; South Dakota State Fair, $6,154.00; Missouri State Fair, $11,664.00. In the Agri - cultural Products the offering is, Nebraska State Fair, $6 672 00- Missouri State Fair, $2,514.00; Kansas State Fair, $825.00- Kansas Free Fair, $1,458.00 and South Dakota, $1,187.50.

Two bicycles given away by the Fair Board and about 50 other prizes donated by the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce were given to the children. Cat and Dog Show The cat and dog fanciers had a very fine exhibit which attracted many people. ATTRACTIONS The Veteran's Day Program was the largest and finest ever put on at the Fair. There were thirty-one bands, drum corps and drill teams. These were from many parts of the State. The Veteran's program with the automobile races attracted one of the largest crowds of the week. While the receipts were not so large, this can be accounted {or in as much as all veterans of the different wars were admitted free, as were all members of bands, drum corps and drill teams. The program put on by the rodeo people was much better than in former years and changing the chutes made a better view of it from the grandstand. The Labor Day night show was declared off on account of the worst wind and rain storm ever experienced dur - ing Fair time, and which did considerable damage on the grounds, inconveniencing a lot of people on account of the wet condition of the parking ground. This kept many away the next day. The Horse Show was the best ever held here in the number of entries and also in the class of stock shown. Some of the classes were as fine as shown anywhere in the west, but the attendance is not what it should be for the class of entertainment. The airplane crash which had been put on at other State Fairs without opposition and drawing record crowds, brought only an ordinary attendance here on account of the ruling and opposition of the Aeronautics Commission. For the first time in a number of years fireworks were put on as an attraction for the night show. The Barn Dance put on by KFAB in the Auditorium was a new attraction at the Pair and they put on some of the best talent used in their programs over the radio. They did not have the at - tendance they were entitled to. The High School band from Seward, Wilber, Pleasant Dale, Malmo, Geneva, Yutan, Elks Boy Scout Band of Omaha, Wisner and Syracuse furnished musical entertainment in front of the grand - stand and other parts of the grounds.

         <seg id="p025">• REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE with their floats which took part in the parade on Thursday of the Fair. Beckmann-Gerety's Carnival occupied the midway on the carni - val grounds and suffered considerable loss in the severe storm of the evening of Labor Day. This is the same carnival which shows on the midway of the Pairs in the Middle West Fair Circuit. IMPROVEMENTS During the last year some of the improvements made on the Fair Grounds are as follows: The old frame building at the corner of Morton and Dunham Avenue was torn down and was replaced by a brick and stucco building 24x64 feet. The old arch at the entrance of the carnival grounds was torn down and a new building 28x28 feet was built with fancy colored lights to light up the en - trance at night. A new dining hall, 20x26 feet, was erected west of the 4-H Club Building. A shower bath and rest room 12x32 feet was built in the Swine Barn. The Auditorium was re-roofed and the old stage torn down and replaced with an up-to-date stage and dressing rooms with store rooms underneath. The old feed barn was torn down and a new building 36x100 feet with a brick tile office 12x12 feet on the side was built. All pens In the cattle and swine barn have been painted with a coat of gray lead and all steel work in Agricultural Hall is being painted with aluminum paint. A permanent brick wall has replaced the wooden panels of the Coliseum. About 2,500 feet of 72 inch heavy steel woven wire was put on the line from the front gate to the State Fisheries Build - ing, the Game, Forestation and Parks Commissloh paying part of the expense, All dead trees have been grubbed out and 3,500 new ones set out on the grounds. About 600 feet of new concrete eight - foot side walk and curb and gutter put in on different parts of the grounds. An estimate by the WPA shows that 44,300 yards of dirt have been moved in straightening Antelope Creek and filling and ditch - ing the grounds. The old Mercantile Building which was built about forty years ago was torn down and ground graded down Much of this work has been done with WPA labor, but It was neces - sary to furnish material and equipment as the sponsors contribution. It was my privilege to visit a; number of State Fairs during the past season, and I feel that I can say without contradiction, that our own state fair, grounds furnish more modern conveniences such as toilets, rest rooms, shower baths, drinking fountains and free seat - ing accomodations, for the benefit of the patrons and exhibitors of the Fair, than any I visited. In our budget request to the Governor, we made a request for an appropriation of f6,450.00 to match up with ?14,000 from the </seg>
         <seg id="p026">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ¦ WPA for a new Mercantile Building. Also $1,200 for a new coating on the pavement on the grounds—the WPA to furnish all labor. The grandstand roof is in need of a new coating of felt and asphalt, we are asking for $3,000 for this, the WPA to furnish $5,000 in labor and material. The WPA have worked out several other pro - jects, but these are the most urgent. It is a wonderful opportunity - tor the State to do this building and repairing at this time when it can be done at less than one-third the cost if the State had to take care of the entire amount. In conclusion I wish to say that I have no apologizes to make for my conduct since 1 have been Secretary. When I took over the office in 193 3 the records will show there was a deficit of $83,161 in notes owed for material, premiums, attractions, etc., and in ad - dition $15,000 in notes owed at the First National Bank. In the past four years all bills have been paid and think I can say that the grounds and buildings are in better condition than any time in the history of the Pair. 1 wish to thank all that have helped to make the Fair a success and especially the Board members and the ladies in the office.

" Respectfully submitted; A. H. Miller, Chairman R.R.Vance L. C. Chapin MR. MILLER: I move you the adoption of the auditing com - mittee's report. MOTION DULY SECONDED, AND UPON BEING PUT TO VOTE WAS DECLARED CARRIED BY THE CHAIR. PRESIDENT BANNING: We are very much pleased this after - noon to have with us the secretary and manager of the Topeka Free Fair at Topeka, Kansas; and it is a pleasure for me at this time to introduce to you Mr. Maurice W. Jencks, of Topeka, Kansas. (Ap - plause) MR. JENCKS: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: Last December, at the annual meeting of the International Fair in Chicago, Mr. Reed asked me if I would come to your meeting. There was a time when I thought I could come and then another time when I thought I couldn't; and today I want to apologize to you for not being here sooner, but the roads are so darn slippery today down in Kansas that I was In luck to get here at all. I don't know what they want me to talk on, but I am going to tell you some of the things that I have learned about the fair business. "¦:¦" '¦"¦¦¦ ' .'•'.¦" I stopped next to a gentleman back there a minute ago and borrowed his paper. I Baw at the head of the column a story that said that the state fair board was an old man's club, and down the column the gentleman, who wrote the article said that they had had a very bad cattle exhibit here, that in fact, the cattle exhibit </seg>
         <seg id="p036">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE was poorer than at some smaller county fairs. I don't know who the gentleman was who wrote the article, but I know something about fairs, and I know something about the number of cattle that are shown at fairs, and I know something about the circumstances; and when the gentleman says there were only so many catfle in a certain department he perhaps doesn't appreciate the fact that the Indianapolis Fair at Indiana is held the same weeks as the Nebraska State Fair, where they give twice or three times as much for cattle than is offered here. He doesn't appreciate the fact that the Min - nesota State Fair at Minneapolis is given the same week as the Nebraska State Fair, and Minnesota offers twice or three times as much money as the Nebraska State Fair. I know what lam talk - ing about, because I go to these fairs, and I have in my records exactly what every fair gives for different departments in livestock. Now, ladies and gentlemen, remember that the man who takes out a herd of Herefords, or a herd of Angus, or whatever it may be, is not going to jump to Lincoln nor to Topeka, where he gets a purse of fifteen dollars for first money if he can go to Minneapolis or to Indiana and get thirty or forty-five; and that must be taken into consideration in the article the gentleman wrote about not having a beef cattle show here. I have been to this fair, and I know what they have as a rule, because I generally come every year. Now, I was amazed to know the money you get .here from the Pari-mutuels. We can't have pari-mutuels nor whiskey or anything else that is worth while in Kansas. The guys that go to the legis - lature and drink the hardest vote "do" when it comes to voting to let somebody else have a drink. Well, I didn't know you could make so much money with pari-mutuels. We have tried to have them down in our state, but we just can't get to first base with them, and I don't know whether they are a good thing or whether they aren't. But I certainly would like to have something that would bring thirty thousand dollars in grandstand receipts at our fair, because thirty thousand dollars in the fair business is a lot of money. Now, you have a lot of county fairs representatives here today, and I want to show you something that will interest you. I got out a card last year, it says "What advertising influenced you to come to the 1938 Kansas Free Fair?", and then I put "radio, circulars, newspaper advertising, window cards and bill boards", and left a place for them to put a cross, trying to find out if I could how much money we were throwing away needlessly, because I thought if they all said "radio" why spend any money on bill boards, news papers, circulars and window cards, and vice versa; then below I asked what they liked best at the fair. Well, you would be surprised. Then you want to know how I found out that they were there; I sent </seg>
         <seg id="p037">REPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE two boys out and got the numbers off of each car for two days, the two big dayß of the fair, then we took those numbers and went to the State House and got the names of the owners of the cars and sent them this postal card, and hitched to it was a nice little note telling him how glad we were to see him at the fair. I suppose the average fellow sat down and thought "how in the thunder did they know my name," but the wise one said "of course they take the numbers off of the cars and then go through the tags to find out that I came there. Anyway about three thousand of these cards came back out of the number we sent out. I just picked up a few of them just right off of the top as I came away today, because I thought you might be interested, because after all a fair is a cross-roads where people from all walks of life come. Don't let any preacher come on the lot—and lam a Christian and Igo to church and I give money to the church, and I believe in them, and God help us if we are ever put where we don't have churches—but don't let any preacher come on the lot and say you can't do this and you can't do that, because the next nine fellows that come on may want to see exactly what he told you he doesn't like; and vice-versa, don't let somebody «ome on the lot and say 'throw that religous exhibit off, beause I don't like it". Now, let me show you the diversities; I didn't pick these out, I took them off of.the top of the pile, the diversities of what brings people to a fair, the exhibits and the elephants—we had an elephant act, and the best elephant act I ever saw, but this fellow liked the exhibits and the elephants, this fellow says "the night show". This one says "exhibits", This one says "The Display of new Farm Machinery"; and, by the way, in my opinion the Ne - braska State Fair has as good if not the best farm machinery ex - hibit that we would find In any fair in any Btate in the union. This one says "Looking at the beautiful displays of Domestic Art". This fellow says "The wonderful enthusiasm and exhibits of the 4-H boys and girls". This one says "all of the exhibits, but why couldn't there be less noise near the 4-H demonstration; weir you could have a lot less noise on a fair grounds but it wouldn't be a fair. This one says "I liked the livestock, and I liked the W.1.8.W. en - tertainment", that is the loud speaker radio. This one says "live stock, horses and the 4-H club work and all the things in agricul - tural hall. This fellow says "I enjoyed the rodeo most, even though it was raining; and I had a grand time". This fellow says "4-H club work and night Bhow". This fellow says ''agricultural dis - plays"; then writes on the end "I could do without the Harlam Stomp", that is the negro show with the carnival company and I would agiee with him there, this fellow says "I suggest that you give the boys and girls a shower bath and the. 4-H girls toilets more privacy"; that is a good card, we took a lot of notice of that. And that is just about the way they run. Now, I have got one or two here I would like to find, but anyway if I don't find it I remember </seg>
         <seg id="p038">KKI'uKT OF NKBUASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE what one fellow said, he said he enjoyed the fair very miuch, but the fellow who had a big glass window filled with spring chickens and a sign on the front says "plate lunch twenty-five cents" and then charges seventy-five cents for spring chicken ought to be run off of the lot; well, I answered that one, I said I am sorry you didn't come in and see me. I would have told him to go back and &gt;read the man's sign, but when a plate lunch sells for twenty-five cents, don't ex - pect to get spring chicken for twenty-five cents. I got another one that said she enjoyed everything but one thing spoiled the fair for her, she said For Gods sake don't let the undertaker display coffins right at the enterance of the women's building". Gentlemen, that shows, you that there is one thing you always have to learn in the fair business, that you can't run a fair to please one fellow. Now we have, I think —I won't say I think, I will say we have the best free fair in America, and if any of you don't think so, you come down and 1 will show you the next time we run not the best free fair in America, but 1 can tell you where the best run free fair is, and it is down here at Belleville, Kansas and I will tell you why it is the best run free fair; you can't find the man who runs the department store in his business during that fair week, but if you have to see him you will find him either selling tickets at the box office in front of the grand stand or taking them there. You can't find (he banker around the bank; he's counting the money and tak - ing care of it. so they go into the town and take out the best interests of the town, and they are all interested in the fair, and believe me that fair is a success, and it is the best run fair in America that 1 have seen, and I have seen a lot of them. Now. we have had a lot of luck with our fair; we have had good weather, for one reason. I am a good deal like Mr. Reed, I took charge- of the Kansas Free Fair in 1932, when it owed about three thousand dollars and didn't have any credit; we couldn't buy even an electric light globe unless we paid for it. Now, we have rebuilt our fair grounds pretty much and have a lot of new buildings throughout the grounds, and are just completing a new agricul - tural building; that is a WPA job, I don't know whether to be ashamed of that or not, but in any event it is a WPA job, and a nice one. and we have got the Kansas Free Fair where it is worth money, it's got prestige, it delivers the goods, and people come there rrotu all over the state of Kansas; don't let anyone tell you they don t, because we keep track of them, and we had them from nlnty - six out of one hundred and five counties one day last year; I have sot the automobile numbers and I will show them to you, and you can write the man that checked the cars. How do we get them there? In the first place we deliver the goods, we run this fair like you run your business and we run </seg>
         <seg id="p039">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE the fair. Don't you ever let this fair get Into polietics, now, if you do the politicans will jmake a foot ball of it, and any fair that gets into politics they will break it sooner or later, why I went to Il - linois to the Illinois State Fair last year, and when I got within fifty-five miles of it, I passed bill boards along the road reading "Governor Homer Invites you to the Illinois State Fair", and we passed them all the way along the line. And when I got to the hotel I left my tickets in the front seat of the car and went in to register and took my baggage up, then got In my car and went out to the fair grounds, and when I got there the tickets were gone; so when I got to the ticket office the girl said "Oh, that is all right, we will give you somemore," so they gave me some more tickets, and I then said "I would like to go and see the grand stand show." and she said "just tell them who you are, that is all you need to do". Then I went to the horse show; and they said "are you a friend of Governor Homer's", I said "Yes" and they said "come on in", I was there three years ago when Curley Brooks, a very fine gentleman, ran for governor against Homer, and they were both going- to give a talk on the fair grounds before the grand stand. Governor Homer took Tuesday and Curley Brooks was going to talk Wednesday. On Tuesday you couldn't get within gun shot of that fairgrounds, because they had sent out more tickets over the state of Illinois on that day than could get in the grounds. On "Wednesday the boys who were running Curley Brooks campaign wanted to know why tickets weren't on sale at the Grand stand, some body had told them you couldn't buy tickets at all so they didn't know what to do", and the outcome was that the republicans broke the fence down there but the democrats got all the tickets, and when Curley Brooks got up to speak he spoke to a democratic audience and they booed him. Now, you talk about parl-mutuels. Do you know where the Illinois State Fair gets its money? Well, the State of Illinois race tracks give the Illinois State Fair a couple of hundred thousand dollars to do business with, and the State Fair is a political foot ball. I took the head of our art department with me to the fair and she said "I want to see your art department"-, s° I went up to a very nice looking lady and said "Are you the superintendent", she said she was. I said "My, you have got a lot of women in there." "Yes", he said we have twenty-tw,o". "Well," I said we have got a bigger art department than you have got, and we run it with three women". She said "Yes, I know, but I have to give all these women jobs". I said "why"/and she said "they are all democrats from around the state and I have to take pare of them". And each department of the Illinois State Fair is handled the same way; so I say, gentlemen, don't let your fair get into politics. </seg>
         <seg id="p040">i;;;i'o/.T of .vkbkaska state board of agricl'LTL'RE I will tell you what I think is building our fair up, we give them the poods. We try not to lie to them. We get the best there is in entertainment. Now, you talk about carnival companies; well, good .carnival companies are hard to get, but a lot of the fellows that are running them are making them the best they can, and four years ago. as Mr. Reed will tell you, the carnival companies in the country were all broke, they were in terrible shape, and they told us at the Chicago International Convention that if we would help them they would put the carnivals on their feet, and they did. You will see a lot of things you don't like about carnival companies, and I might see a lot of things too, but just the same you go and find a successful fair without a carnival company and without entertain - ment and I will find twenty of them that have them. Now, when you get to your grand stand attractions the biggest mistake a show man ever made in the world—and I have tried for thirty-five years to make a living out of the show business— the biggest mistake a show man ever made is to pick you for a sucker, and that is what the average show man thinks he .can do, and when I say this I mean the man past fifty, is to beat your grand stand. I have seen it done, and you have seen it done here too, right in Lincoln, I have seen them cheating and you have seen them cheating. The way to build up your grand stand attractions is to get the best you can get; it will cost you, we pay twice as much for our night shows as we ought to pay, but it delivers the goods and it does the job, and we draw, I think, one of the biggest grand stands of any midwest fair for a small town with our night show; but we get the best we can get, and the best is none too good for the farmer who comes two hundred miles or a hundred miles to your fair and wants to see something worth while. So, gentlemen, I could talk here for a week on fairs, but I would just like to leave that with you if I can; that any fair that goes into politics is in danger, and the fairs that are successful and the most successful are the fairs that deliver good clean entertainment and the kind of entertainment the man who .climbs up the grand stand really thinks he ought to see. 1 thank you.

BANNING: It is pra^ticaHy the same line, along £ S * °ne time ln the we had a ruling SL'^ f Br!r CoUrt- At that time they construed the worf fl may as-must"; but then there is; nothing sure about that. Your attention is called to this bill that you might take it up wi h 121 members and it will C ome up here next Tuesday at twS RM. be - fore the committee, and you who are Interested should write your representatives and &gt;Bk them t o do what they can for the Jostpone- Jg of this bill.

Not only a depression might cause the county board to get the spirit It wanting to.,«nt down expenses and make the county fair the goat, conJ 6 haVe tbat E6t °n fioun* boards **o jus common ordinary men, and who might have a sore spot aga ns some members of;the fair board, and who might use their influence on the coun y board against the county fair. We had an instance in Cedar County, we had a county board that was a little btt sore at^the county fair, and for three years they didn't even give us a dollar of money in Cedar County, even though the law now says they shall. We could have forced it, as they did In BuHer Count? where they took it to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court decided the County board could be compelled to issue this money but we got along without it through the bad years, and last year when we organized a new association, the old one having gone bank rupt, we didn't get a cent, last year they finally did consen" to par premiums; but we have got the new board now to make the regular appropriations for the coming year. regular </seg>
         <seg id="p050">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE So you see there are many things that might stop them from making that levy besides a depression. I think it is a very small thing to just change In the bill that word "shall" to "may", but it might make a lot of difference to the county fairs. MR.

I am quite sure there would be some who would like to have some. PRESIDENT BANNING: Is Mr. Steele in the room? I thought maybe he might have a copy of that. Have you got a copy of that bill in your pocket? MR. STEELE: No, I haven't. PRESIDENT BANNING: Mr. Reed says that he has one which the committee can use.

So remember that; use the office if you have anything you want to tell them about or if you have something in the way of revision of premiums, and I- assure you it will have the prompt and best consideration we can give it. ; Now then, if there is nothing more— MR. C. Y. THOMPSON: (Interrupting) Mr. Chairman. PRESIDENT-ELECT SHUBERT: Mr. C. Y. Thompson. MR. C. Y. THOMPSON: In the meeting of the State County Fair Managers Association I made a motion for the appointment of a committee to meet with a like committee from this organization to work out a reorganization program for our state board. As far as I know there has been no report of that committee. I would like to hear their .report. PRESIDENT-ELECT SHUBERT: Well; I wonder if that com - mittee has preformed their work, and are they ready to report? MR. C. Y. THOMPSON.- They certainly have, and they are ready to report. . A DELEGATE: ; Mr. Chairman, four members from the State Association and four members from the county fair managers as - sociation met in the back end of the room. The principal point of discussion was the question of whether or not we should have a new secretary for the insuing year. In this committee there was a motion made and seconded that we recommend Mr. Millie as sec - retary for the insuing year. The mover of the motion asked that a vote be had of this committee on the recommendations. The chairman of the committee—the joint committee was a chairman of the state committee. He said "that is not necessary, -we are of the same opinion". The mover asked the second time for a vote, and he was asked "don't you trust us?". So it was agreed—there was a gentleman's agreement that we were unanimous and that the chairman mentioned that there should be no campaign or no politics in the matter of voting on who should be secretary, to which we all agreed; but it was also specifically mentioned to our chairman that he was to read to you the opinion or recommendation of that committee. That was not done. That is the report of that committee. And it replied to the remarks of the chairman of acting for assistance and cooperation and help of those that are not connected with the state board, as one member, and as one representative of one county fair I say that that does not encourage cooperation. </seg>
         <seg id="p060">KEPOHT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PRESIDENT-ELECT SHUBERT: Has any one else anything to say? ME. C. Y. THOMPSON: I made that motion because I felt that the criticism of the fair board was hard. I feel that the men should talk this thing out rather than to get up that fighting spirit, that prejudice after which we don't use our best judgment, and thresh this thing out. So I was critisied for not supporting the resolution that was passed as I was expected to, and tried to be fair with the State Board because they have been charged with having a wheel within a wheel and using the steam roller; and it just seems to me this is just one of the finest examples I have ever seen of how the thing works. PRESIDENT-ELECT SHUBERT: Any one else? MR. BANNING: We are talking about steam rollers. If there hasn't been a steam roller in the county fair association I don't know what you call it. We are all willing at times to ride on the steam roller. We have had two steam rollers here, you had in your county association. The thing that I resented, gentlemen, more than anything else — I am sorry that this thing occurred —but the thing I resented more than anything else was the misrepresentation of the fairs of the State of Nebraska. I sat in the convention yesterday morning and they run the steam rollers down that, ran the steam roller over the whole thing without any consideration and the reports of th° secretary later on in the afternoon showed absolutely that the statements that were in the resolution were not true. That is what creates resentment here, is that kind of a thing. You have had a steam roller, gentlemen, in your .county association just as well as in the fair board, and I think that caused more friction. The misrepresentation of the Nebraska State Fair has caused more friction than any thing else. I am {or the truth, and I am for the facts to come out, and I dare any man to take the repords and prove the contents of that resolution down there or a portion of it. That is what starts these troubles. Now, lets get down to business. If there is something wrong here let's fix it out; but gentlemen, whatever you do or whatever &gt; maybe done on the part of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture or the County Fairs Association, never allow these fairs to get into politics. If you do you have done just as Mr. Jencks said yesterday, you are through. Now, we pan iron out these troubles, but we have just got too much of head on coming from both sides, there is where the trouble lies. If anything on earth puts me into fighting .humor it is misrep - resentation of anything. I don't blame the county fair association, </seg>
         <seg id="p061">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 61 I think they have been missinformed on a lot of these things. Let's give the county fair association credit and let's give the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture a little credit. We have stood up against a buzz saw, and we have sat in a mighty hard position and we have used our best efforts In the interests of the Nebraska State Fair; and I want to see the samething in the county fairs, because the State Fair is the parent of the county fairs. We' should cooperate here, I would like to avoid all friction that may occur here. Let's iron it out someway. If we need some changes let's make them, but let's be fair in the proposition. We have been pulling both ways, let's get together and pull together. , MR. C. Y. THOMPSON: Now, Mr. Chairman, I don't want to monopolize the floor but I. am not going to sit here and take what Mr. Banning Is trying to feed us, I thought I was trying to be fair with the State Board; that was my object in making the motion to have a commute representing both organizations to iron this thing out, that was the reason for that motion, and to say there has been some misrepresentation, I defy him to say who it is, I acknowledged it when you made the motion that I thought it was probably unfor - tunate that Mr. Leadley's name had been mentioned in that resolu - tion, and I defy him to say that there was anything In that resolu - tion that was misrepresenting anything; all the resolution palled for was a committee of ; understanding so that we could present our different view points and come to some conclusion. My personal idea was that if things are all right the way they are the committee should report that way; if it appeared to be that they didn't report that way they handed this report in with the understanding that it should be presented before the election of officers; and It wasn't done. That wasn't treating our committee fair, and that is why lam protesting. There was absolutely no misrepresentation of the board, of any member of the State County Fair Managers Association, if there was any misrepresentation it was on the part of others out - side. (Applause). •¦¦'•¦¦¦' ;• ¦ MR. BANNING: Mr/Chairman, I agree with Mr. Thompson. I don't believe the association did, but they endorsed Mr. Leadley's remarks in this motion; then you say they didn't misrepresent now, and it was proven to you yesterday afternoon and Mr. Reed's figures and the records show that the association did not go any further, then: it was not what; he said; and I agree like Mr. Thompson, I think it was a bad thing when Mr. Leadley's name was mentioned. PRESIDENT-ELECT SHUBERT: Mr. Thompson, I would like to have that resolution read. ' : MR. JOE S. STEELE: Mr. Chairman, gentlemen of the con - vention, I am in a rather peculiar position in this fight, I am a member of the fair board and also a member of the County fair </seg>
         <seg id="p062">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE setup, an officer; so that it really is rather embarrassing in some respects but 1 think we are all getting a little heated up liere. When I came down here to this fair meeting I had been notified by letter that there was going to be some fireworks, and when I got the letter I thought the fireworks was coming from another angle; [ thought it was coming from an association which centered in Omaha. I am not going to mention any association, but I thought that association was out to kill the fair. And I was ready to stand behind the State Board until the frost covered the water, but after I got down here I found that wasn't true. I do know, so do you, that there has been considerable criticism going on over the state of Nebraska for the past four or five years as to the managment of our fair. We saw the other evening when Mr. Leadley gave his address that there was considerable fire all over the state according to the questionaires and to the answers got. I don't know who he sent them to I didn't get one, but that doesn't make any difference, a good many did; and according to the answers to those questionaires there is dissatisfaction. So I talked to some of the older members of the State Board, men who are on the managing committee of the board and I suggested, and I still suggest it, I suggested to these men that they must make a few confessions, make a few changes in order to straighten this thing out and keep it from getting into the legislature. Now, if we let this go as It stands Tight now, I am telling you that there will be a bill introduced tomorrow. It is gone, I know it is gone, I think I know who has possession of it and they will put it in the hopper, and it will pass, because as long as we have made no confession whatever and no change there is roing to be a \ot of power put behind that bill; and if it passes there won't be any of us men that are on the board today on—the governor might pick one or two up political just like Mr. Jencks de?.cribed in Illinois. And we will have the same experience in a very short time if that happens. I think it is better, and good judgment as Mr. Banning says&gt; to iron this thing out here, even if we have to back up and re-elect some officers and try to get this thing so it will satisfy the State of Ne - braska. (Applause) PRESIDENT-ELECT SHUBERT: Has any one else got anything to say. If not, the chair will entertain a motion to adjourn. MR. BANNING: We have that motion. PRESIDENT-ELECT SHUBERT: Did we have the motion. MOTION PUT TO VOTE AND DECLARED CARRIED, AND THE MEETING ADJOURNED BY THE CHAIR. </seg>

         <seg id="p085">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS H.L. Wahlgren Elk City, We have a very full and interesting program this morning and must keep on schedule so I shall say here only what seems to be required. I first want to thank you for the confidence shown at the last annual meeting when you chose me to head the organization. I fully appreciate the honor and more especially the responsibilities connected with the office and I pledge my best efforts to help carry on the important work of the organization. This may take some thought and effort but it becomes rather a pleasure when working with men like our Board of Directors and our secretary-treasurer, D. L. Gross, and Assistant secretary, Elvin Frolik. I could not go on from he&gt;re without expressing regret that our retiring president, Mr. C. Y. Thompson, felt that he must ask to be relieved of duty. He served six years as the Association Presi - dent and his guiding hand in all work of the Association was appre - ciated by all of those who worked with him and he will be missed by everyone. Few, if any, ever did more for the Association or for Nebraska agriculture in general. The Crop Growers is primarily an Association of Nebraska far - mers for Nebraska farmers/but services are available to, and ren - dered for, others whose work or business brings them in contact with farmers. The activities are rather varied but all have as their aim assistance and aid for Nebraska agriculture. Certiflcation Right here I should like to report on these activities. One of the most important of these is seed certification which we carry out under terms of the Nebraska State Seed Law. For comparison I give you total amounts of seed certified for 1937 and 1938: Certified seed: 1938 1937 Small grain 135,000 Bu. 91,848 Bu Sorghums 65,000 Bu. 26,560 Bu. Sudan 255,000 Lbs. 17,000 Lbs. Hybrid corn 51,000 Bu. 28,000 Bu. This shows you how great is the increase during a single year. I hope and believe that all of them will show increases as years go by. The planting of hybrid corn is increasing rapidly and whether or not hybrid seed corn is certified in increasing amounts depends entirely on what the farmers who buy it, demand. There are now, and may always be, just as good uncertified hybrids as certified ones for sale, but I rather think that the time is not far off when the </seg>

         <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION We had a certified seed exhibit at the State Fair and the same at the Ak-Sar-Ben showing the best adapted varities of small grains, hybrid corn, sorghums, and alfalfa. Four thousand pamphlets "Good Seed Pays" were distributed. This contained a list of the certified seed growers. We contributed ?100.00 towards the cost of taking the College Crops Judging Team to Kansas City, where they placed second, and to the International at Chicago where they placed first in grading and identification; second in judging. David McGill was high man in this contest. . ¦ '. The 4-H Crops Judging team received $50.00 from our As - sociation to help with their expenses at the Chicago International. They ranked Bth and were a long way from the bottom. These trips encourage boys to enter 4-H Crops Clubs and I firmly think activities of this kind have already helped and will help more yet to keep agriculture on a high plane. Each year we hold a Certified Seed Show in the Crops Labora - tory. Grain and Beed are placed on display at the start of these meetings and ribbons are awarded to best samples. Here you may be able to find the lot and variety of seed you desire as these sam - ples should represent the seed as it is sold by the grower. My advice is to use certified seed if you would be sure of what you are getting. Everyone here knows something of the vast loss which farmers suffered in the few years just past, because they got some - thing else when they asked for a certain sweet stalk sorghum. Many of the sorghum seeds cannot be identified by experts and most of us can identify very few, and even then not be able to tell anything as to purity. . : ¦".' I would especially call your attention to the Crop Growers Annual Report. It has always been good and seems to be getting better steadily. • Get a copy and keep it handy for reference. It is "chuck full" of good information. Last year 900 copies were printed which is a 300 increase over the previous year. If demand grows, more can be printed. These are distributed to all .members of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association, and to Experiment Sta - tion libraries, etc. .'. ¦'¦' '¦'.•¦ ''¦I; Pasture—Forage—Livestock Program One of our big interests Is the Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Live - stock Program. I am indebted to our assistant secretary, Mr. Elvin Prolik for preparing a report on this important program. He worked hard on this activity and really knows what it's all about. Here is the summary as prepared by Mr. Frolik: </seg>
         <seg id="p088">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program replaced the Past - ure Contest this year. This was the fourth year for the existence of this project, and on the broader basis, it was the most successful season we have had. As in the past, the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association cooper - ated with the University of Nebraska Extension Service, the Ne - braska Livestock Breeders' Association, and the Omaha Chamber of Commerce in sponsoring the project. These were the organizations which set up the program and which furnished most of the person - nel and finances to carry on the work. But it is only fair to give credit at this time to other organizations which, cooperated In bring - ing the program to a successful close for the season. These Included the Agricultural Conservation Program, the U. S. Forest Service the Soil Conservation Service, the Farm Security Administration, and many civic organizations over the state. Any success or accomplish - ments for our efforts must, of course, be credited largely to the farmers and ranchers throughout Nebraska who cooperated in mak - ing real progress in their pasture-forage-livestock problems this year. I believe it will be well to review the eight-point program set up in this project almost a year ago. They were: (1) Meet the present emergency by producing sufficient high-quality roughage so that present livestock can contribute an increased amount to farm income. (2) Rehabilitate drouth-injured grasslands. (3) Restore to permanent grassland the more than two million acres now under cultivation which can be used more profitably for hay or pasture. (4) Conserve soil fertility and increase the acreage of soil building and erosion controlling forage crops. (5) Maintain a proper balance between livestock numbers and forage production. (6) Give more thought to proper utilization of forage crops produced, both through placing more emphasis on quality of roughages produced and live - stock programs which will utilize forage to greater advantage. (7) Build up feed reserves for productive livestock. (8) Seek to es - tablish landlord-tenant relationships that will encourage more live - stock production on tenant operated farms. It is impossible in this brief report to give you all of the de - tails of what was done in carrying on the project. Briefly the work included the following: An illustrated printed four-page circular describing the program and giving questions and answers on pas - ture-forage-livestock problems was distributed to a total of. 81,700 farmers including some farmers in every Nebraska county in the early spring. Two illustrated circular letters were printed by the Extension Service and distributed by county agricultural agents to farmers. The first one was put out in April and had to do largely with making plans to provide ample feed for livestock. The second published in the middle of May had to do with sorghums. Over </seg>
         <seg id="p089">I 'NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 30,000 copies of each were distributed. Two well illustrated "dod - gers" were printed and distributed during the summer. One of these called attention to filling silos and the second to harvesting and feeding grain sorghums. As all of you know, Mr. George Round, extension editor, did a very good job of getting stories on the pro - gram published in farm papers, daily papers, and weekly papers. The radio was also utilized in getting latest information to the farmers. Over 1200 cooperators located in all but 17 counties in the state enrolled in the project and kept accurate records of their pas - ture-forage-Jivestock practices. Slightly over 800 of this number completed their work in the project. This limited number of farmers were really demonstrators in developing information for the rest of the farmers In the state to use. The program was presented at many meetings in the state. Of chief interest are the finish-up meetings held at Holdrege and Omaha. The first regional finish-up meeting was held at Holdrege on Novem - ber 3 in cooperation with the South Platte United Chambers of Commerce. There some 400 farmers attended the "clinic" in the afternoon. The evening attendance of GOO farmers and business men broke the all-time attendance record for that organization. Perhaps! the most successful farm gathering of the year was the finish-up of the statewide P-F-L program in Omaha on November 22. A total of 512 farmers from 53 different counties attended the after - noon clinic, at the Paxton Hotel. The evening recognition banquet and meeting drew better than 600. Three farmers were honored and 25 given honorable mention. I should like to add that we feel privileged that we can work with these organizations in carrying on this P-F-li-progiram. It would be a big order for any one organization to carry on and I was never surer of anything than that It Is of tremendous value. We contributed $300.00 to this program and feel that no money was ever better used. There are many other things that I should like to dwell on but, as I suggested at the outset, we have many other things this morn - ing so had best move on to them. THE 1938 CORN YIELD TESTS Virgil H. Welch Agr. College Any crop that occupies annually nearly one-half of our culti - vated land, as does corn in Nebraska, certainly merits all of the .effort which is being put forth to improve it and make it a more </seg>
         <seg id="p090">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE satisfactory and profitable crop for our farms. The rapid expansion of the corn hybrid industry Is bringing about keener competition and thereby causing more intensive research and experimentation to develop better hybrids for the agricultural world. The standard by which a hybrid must be measured is becoming a little higher each year, especially in regard to certain characteristics of the plant itself. The mode of inheritance of various characteristics is known to such an extent that by studying the inbred parents the corn breeder can know before he makes a cross about how the plant of the result - ing hybrid will look. He can predict that it will or will not sucker; will have a high or low ear; and that it will have a tall, medium, or short stalk. It is also true that even with this improved kind of corn we have the old problem of adaptation but in a different form. The seed of a hybrid may be made in any locality without affecting the inherited type of that hybrid to any appreciable degree. But to know that a hybrid will fit into a given area it must actually be tested under the environmental conditions existing in that area. The increasing number of hybrids offered for sale from year to year adds complexity to the farmer's problem of selecting one to plant on his farm. Because of this large number of available hy - brids and the need of an actual trial of hybrids under our con - ditions some official system of testing is necessary. In order to more adequately aid the farmer in his selection of a type to grow as well as to aid the breeder in his production of corn for the widely different climatic conditions of the various areas of Nebraska it seemed advisable to expand and improve our state tests in 1938. The Testing Program The testing program included eight large tests in as many coun - ties in the eastern third of the state known as official yield tests. These were conducted cooperatively by the Experiment Station, Ex - tension Service, the county agents of the counties in which the tests were located, and the farmer in each county who supplied the land and tilled the crop. The plans for this set of tests placed a limit of 54 entries which could be accepted for any one test. An entry fee of $5.00 per hybrid for each test was charged to help finance the tests and to limit the entries to only those with possibilities for production in this state. Each, producer was allowed only one ex - perimental hybrid and a total of four in any one test. Any hybrid submitted for testing was by requirement in at least four of the tests. This latter requirement was added so that we might obtain data which would tell us something of a hybrid's range of adaptation. In addition to the 8 official tests, there were some 65 county agent tests throughout the state mainly for demonstrations. The </seg>
         <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Agronomy Department also conducted a test on river-bottom land near Peru as well as one on a large scale in Burt county There were also tests conducted at the various experimental substations under irrigation in some case.s and dry-land conditions in others. Location of Tests This report includes data from the official yield tests as well as station tests located in Nemaha and Burt counties.

May 23, 24, &amp; 25 The dry weather so severely injured the crop in Knox, Polk, Madison and Cass counties that the tests in those counties were abandoned However, the remaining tests were harvested and were considered quite satisfactory from the standpoint of comparison. Methods of Testing The official yield testß consisted of from 50 to 54 entries planted in six replications in each field, distributed in such a manner as to have a fair representation of air hybrids on the different levels of fertility of the soil within the field. The entries in each test included six ordinary farm varieties, from six to eight experimental hybrids, and the [remaining one were commercial hybrids. The planting was done by hand and at a double rate and later the plants were thinned out leaving a stand of 2 and 3 plants per hill; i. c., 2 plants were left in each hill of replications 1, 3, and s - while 3 plants were left in the hills of replications 2, 4, and 6. The Plots were made up of four rows 10 hills long with the border rows being considered as buffer rows to eliminate unequal competition effects. . ¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p092">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE The test planting in Burt county was thinned to a uniform stand of three plants per hill and consisted of only five replications. The one on bottomland near Peru was planted with the plan in mind to thin it in the same manner as the. official tests; however, the stand was such that it became necessary to thin two replications to 3 plants per hill and the remaining four to 2 per hill. Identity of Hybrids Throughout the testing procedure the entries were known only by a code number and only after all calculations had been made were the names attached to the data. The only exception to this was in connection with the field demonstrations held at each location and then the identity was revealed for only the first replication; the stakes were then pulled and later the plots were harvested and weighed using only their code number.

Yield Calculations The two interior rows of each four-row plot were harvested for yield. At the time of harvest moisture samples were saved in dupli - cate and used to determine shelling percentage as well as the mois - ture content of grain. The yields are for shelled corn with 14 per cent moisture and are the average of all replications in each test. The standard error of the experiment was calculated by the "vari - ance ' method and from this the amount required for significance of yield differences was obtained for all but the Burt county test. This is of value in determining what yield differences are true inherited differences and not due to chance in sampling or field placement. Other Characteristics Reported Actual counts were made on the plots for total number of </seg>

These are reported in terms of number per 100 plants based on actual plant counts. In the Burt county test ad - ditional notes were taken as: plant and ear height, date in tassel, and date ripe. Quality determinations were made for entries in all but the Burt county test. These were made from a shelled corn sample taken as a composite from two replications and actually represent the separation of healthy or sound grain from the unsound with percentage obtained from, weights! .¦¦"¦'¦,' " . f " ' " ; ; .-• , '..'. •.

This Indicates that small differences should be given little if any weight in the analysis of the data. In Dodge county there were only six y hybrids significantly better than the average of all ordinary varieties. In the Richardson, Wayne, Nemaha, arid Saline county tests there were, respectively, 11, 11, 15, and 18 entries which yielded sig - nificantly above the average of the ordinary varieties. There was no single entry at the top in any two tests. Com - mercial hybrids topped the lists in all but two cases and in these a different experimental hybrid was high in each test. However, In all tests the high-yielding entry was a hybrid. The highest place any ordinary farm variety made through its yield was sixteenth. Such varieties usually ranked among the lower half of the entries. In three of the tests the lowest yield was made by a variety and in three a hybrid was low. Even with the advancement made in corn breeding there are hybrids that would not be profitable to grow. _ Eighteen state supervised corn hybrid tests are planned for 1939. Theso will extend from Richardson County In the east to Morrill County in the west. </seg>
         <seg id="p094">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 94 The data show that in Richardson county the hybrid and variety yields were very close together with only 6 per cent superiority on the part of the hybrids, while in Saline county the difference in favor of hybrids was 29 per cent (Table 7). This difference in relation to each other might be explained by the popular theory that where conditions are more adverse hybrids do relatively better as the average yield of the Richardson county test was 65.3 bushels per acre and Saline only 15.9 bushels. However, it might be due in part to the fact that there were fewer hybrids in the Richardson county test large and late enough for that area and the average variey more nearly fit that area than did the average hybrid in - cluded in the test. In the Nemaha county test where conditions were the most nearly ideal a difference of 12 per cent was obtained in favor of hybrids. For this test several large and late hybrids were selected. Of the four hybrids certified in Nebraska, lowa 939 made the best yield with the other three in this order: Nebr. 110, Nebr. 238, and Nebr. 252 (Table 2). For a 6-year period all four hybrids have a good record with lowa 939 having a somewhat higher yield than (he other three (Table 3). This table is of interest as the perfor - mance of hybrids over a period of years is more significant than for one year only. When the yields are summarized for all tests according to the two rates of planting, the hybrids were 10 per cent higher in yield than the varieties at the 2-plant rate and 16 per cent higher at the 3-plant rate (Table 4). This would indicate that, in general, hy - brids are more able to produce under severe conditions of competition than are open-pollinated varieties. This is emphasized by the com - parison in the Saline county test, where at the 2- plant rate, hybrids outyielded varieties 9 per cent and at the 3-plant rate this difference was increased to 62 per cent. The following tables give a summary of the results of the six tests harvested in 1938. </seg>

         <seg id="p097">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 97 IMPROVING THE QUALITY OP MARKET WHEAT Fred B. Siefer ~ NEBRASKA GRAIN IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Corn Getting More Attention During the past few years the hybrid corn program has been pushed vigorously, and I think It has been a benefit to the farmer. Of course, here there is a selfish angle—the sale of hybrid seed. The fact that the seed has to be renewed each year makes the seed bus - iness a profitable one. Sometimes I wish that a wheat hybrid pro - gram could be developed like the hybrid corn program so we could make similar progress. The only way a company or an individual could make any money on wheat seed would be to bring out a new model each year, and this isn't easily done. Public Demanding Higher Quality As a result of a higher standard of living, the world is demand - ing more quality, and I suppose we have only begun stressing quality products. You hear it from every angle. Some companies are so determined to get the proper quality of wheat that they send crews of men out before harvest to spot the areas from which they wish to purchase their wheat. If an area is growing a poor milling wheat the buyers refuse to buy wheat originating from stations in those areas. Smart buyers let the other buyers take the poor wheats. This lack of competition results In a lower price to the farmer. In the production of higher quality grains Agricultural colleges and seed associations .have been hard at work. The commeidal interests also recognized this tremendous task of crop improvement and are now assisting the Agricultural colleges with the work. History of Commercial Crop Improvement Association Let me briefly acquaint you with the history of the Commercial Crop Improvement Association. Canada was the first to pioneer in a unique method of improving grain. You might call it a visual demonstration method. They collect hundreds of samples of grain from farmers as they deliver their grain to elevators. These are planted, each sample is kept separate and then in the summer the farmer ia asked to a meeting to see all of these different -wheats, of ¦which his is one. At the same time each farmer's wheat is inspected by a trained plant breeder who points out to the farmer the good and bad characteristics of his wheat. This method has become so popular in Canada that they are now testing about 20,000 different farmers' wheat each year. Two years ago Kansas adopted this method, it is sponsored by the Kansas Wheat Improvement As- </seg>
         <seg id="p098">KEi'ORT OF XEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sociation. Oklahoma has also organized an association which is carrying out the same plan. The Nebraska Grain Improvement As- Association started in July of this year. In addition to this the spring wheat area has an improvement association oper - ating under the name of The Northwest Crop Improvement Associa - tion at Minneapolis. Indiana also has a crop improvement pro - gram working in eight counties in Indiana. That Association has developed a portable seed cleaning and treating outfit on rubber wheels, and they now treat more than one-third of all the seed wheat planted in those eight counties. This seed treating device may have possibilities here in Nebraska. They say they can even take bind - weed out of wheat with the cleaning machine they have developed. Nebraska Grain Improvement Program While the Nebraska Grain Improvement Association is spon - sored by commercial interests of Nebraska, we expect to coordinate a program with the program of the Agricultural College. This first year we have selected the following twenty-one counties: WHEAT CffOP TESTING PLAN PLOTS wn.^' ———I—l2^:—l.

         <seg id="p099">XEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION* 99 With the help of the County Agents and grain dealers we succeeded in collecting 100 or more samples of wheat in each county. Our intention was to select these at random. Then when a person saw them all growing side by side he would get a picture of the wheat of an entire county. After these wheat samples were collected we cleaned them for planting and divided the winter wheat in three packages, one sam - ple to be planted in the county where it was collected, the second sample to be planted in the master test plot which Dr. Quisenberry here at the College is supervising, and the third sample is to be kept for future reference. In case of spring wheats, we also planted a master test plot at Alliance. The master plot at Lincoln will con - tain all of the 2100 samples from the 21 counties. In each case the County Agent selected the farm on which this test is to be held. Next summer meetings will be held In each county as. well as a large meeting here at Lincoln, providing the wheat comes through the winter.. Just as the Canadians do, each farmer's wheat will be graded by trained men. Here we will especially need the services of the train - ed cerealist connected with the Agricultural College. The growing samples will be graded "A", "B" or " C" on the basis of purity of sample, freedom from rye, smut and varietal mixtures. Grade "A" will be given only to pure, adapted and recommended varieties. "B" will be an in-between group, and "C" will be given to unadapted varieties, mixtures of all sorts and poor quality wheat. We trust that the personal interest of having your own wheat in this test will induce you to come to the meeting. Follow Up With Seed Distribution Of course, the ultimate aim is to get farmers with a poor wheat to get better seed. They say, "feeing is Believing." Well, the strength of this plan lies in convincing those with poor wheat that it is poor. Then when a farmer asks the question, "What am I going to do about it?", we expect to be able to say: "Well, John Jones has an "A" wheat. Go and get some seed from him." We also expect many grain dealers to assist in the; distribution of this good seed; wheat. Right in that connection I am trying to get grain men acquainted with the certified seed program of the Crop Growers Association. My office can act as a clearing house for those orders. I believe all of us concerned in' .higher quality need to place em - phasis on making good seed easier : to get. Why shouldn't these elevator agents and grain companies he handling certified seeds? There is an opportunity for them to perform a service to their customers. If a simple plan can be arranged. I believe we can make </seg>
         <seg id="p100">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE progress along that line. Canada has done a fine job of seed distri - bution. All Grains Included While I have talked only about wheat, our organization plans to assist -wherever it can on a program to help Nebraska farmers. Since the soybean processing plants have been built in Ne - braska, there is an increasing interest in soybeans. We expect to help carry on some demonstrational work and also to collect and distribute soybean information. Farmers who want to grow soy - beans need to know more about growing them, the proper varieties and methods of cultivation. We want to keep our program in line with what the Agricul - tural College is advocating, and we are glad to help out wherever we can. PROGRESS OF THE GRASS RESEARCH PROGRAM A. L. Prolik Agricultural College Experimental work is being carried on with perennial grasses in Nebraska (1) to determine means of improving pasture and range lands, (2) to determine the best methods and species for reseeding of pastures, meadows, and marginal lands, and (3) to develop species and strains of grasses adapted for forage production and soil con - servation practices for different areas of the state. This discussion will deal with the most important phases of the program. One can hardly discuss any one of the objectives just enumerated with - out involving the others. The Pasture Situation Permanent grasslands, as a Jesuit of the severe drouth of the past several years, have passed through a period of the lowest state of productivity in the history of Nebraska. On October 1, 1937, based on estimates issued by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the condition of Nebraska pastures was 36 per cent of normal. The October 1, 1938 estimate for the state places the condition at 67 per cent of normal. This marked improvement is due primarily to the more favorable season, but also to reduced grazing which was brought about by the reduction in the number of livestock during the drouth years. This reduction has in many Instances meant liftle or no grazing. In a good system of pasture or range management, proper grazing will normally maintain pasture lands in a good state of productivity. The drouth damaged pasture lands severely. More favorable conditions will bring much of this pasture land back at </seg>
         <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION least partially as has been so strikingly shown this year. However, at this critical point of recovery, controlled grazing is especially important. Such grazing should be judicious in the most extreme cases and in many instances it is best to discontinue grazing en - tirely for two or three years to permit more rapid recovery. Some late summer and fall grazing can be practiced with very little harm - ful effect. Sudan provides pasture during July and August when other pastures are short and need rest. The use of certified sudan seed reduces danger of poisoning. No farm practice will pay such good dividends as will the usage of sound grazing practices with Nebraska's pasture lands. Deferred grazing in the spring and proper stocking throughout the grazing season should be strictly observed. Cultural practices such as ireseeding will prove to be beneficial only to the extent that they are followed by proper grazing procedure. Other means in addition to good weather and proper grazing may, however, be used to increase our grass resources. It is some of the other means which will be developed in this discussion. Adaptation of Important Grass Species There are about 200 different kinds of grasses growing in Ne - braska. Of these, a comparatively small number furnish most of the grassland cover in meadows and pastures. These grasses are of two principal kinds: (l) the tame or introduced grasses such as bromegrass, crested wheatgrass, bluegrass, orchard grass, redtop, and timothy, and (2) the native grasses such as big bluestem, little </seg>
         <seg id="p102">RiiPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAKD OP AGRICULTURE bluestem, side-oats grama, switchgrass, blue grama, and buffalo grass. The Introduced grasses which have been brought into the state have become the most important group in the pastures in the east - ern part of the state. Certain ones, such as bromegrass and crested wheatgrass have been used some in the western part of the state. During the recent drouth these grasses with the possible exception of bromegvass have suffered severely and the pastures In which they grew are today, for the most part in a deplorable condition. The native grasses are the important grasses in the pastures of the western three-fourths of the state. They also suffered from the drouth but have, as has been previously suggested, recovered mark - edly where not handicapped by grazing. Whereas, reseeding of the tame grasses is practically a necessity, the native grasses recover a great deal through proper grazing. Another distinction between the Introduced and native grasses is their respective seasonal periods of growth. The introduced grass - es, viz. timothy, orchard grass, and bluegrass make their maximum growth during the spring and again during the fall months. Brome - grass of this group comes the closest to continuing growth. during the summer months. On the other hand, most of the native'grasses such as the bluestems, grama grasses, and buffalo grass resume growth late in the spring, make their maximum growth during sum - mer months and cease growth with the first frost in the fall. There are a few native grasses such as western wheatgrass and the needle grasses which make their growth chiefly in the spring and fall just as do the introduced grasses. Harvesting Grass Seed The pastures of eastern Nebraska can be brought back most rapidly with artificial reseeding as soon as conditions are favorable. A mixture consisting of 14 pounds of bromegrass seed and 4 pounds of alfalfa seed per acre is generally recommended. Artificial reseeding of ruined pastures and seeding of culti - vated and marginal lands with native grasses also offers consider - able promise, particularly for the central and western parts, of the state. This method should not be considered as a means of revo - lutionizing the maintenance of good pasture lands in those parts of Nebraska but rather as a supplementary aid to proper management practices. The seed of several valuable native grasses has been success - fully harvested on a large scale from pastures and meadows. These include western wheatgrass, blue grama, sideoats grama, big blue - stem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and sand dropseed. </seg>
         <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION _ Side Oats Brama seeded in May and photo taken in September. Produced SoO lbs. of seed per acre the same year planted. If the harvesting of seed is contemplated in pastures or mead - ows, the fields should be carefully checked to see if there is an abundant quantity of seed in the heads. It is also quite essential to .have at least a fairly good stand of grass. There is a wide vari - ation in the amount of seed produced from year to year in a given field. The year of 1938 was very favorable to the production of abundant quantities of seed of such species as big bluestem and sand dropseed. The seed yields reported. later are those obtained from pastures and meadows. Blue grama grass is short in stature and produces light chaffy seed. It usually produces two crops of heads, the first crop dur - ing July and the second crop during the latter part of August and the first part of September. The flowers are quite susceptible to blasting during hot weather. This fact should be considered in examining the heads for seeds. Blue grama grass can be most suc - cessfully harvested with strippers. It should yield 20 to 25 pounds of seed per acre with the seed having a purity of 30 to 40 per cent. Side-oats grama can be harvested with strippers but a combine is more satisfactory. A good yield of seed is 75 pounds per acre with the seed having a purity of 20 to 25 per cent. Big bluestem can be harvested with strippers if the growth is not too tall,! but a combine is much more satisfactory, particularly where the plants are tall. Combining will produce yields of 50 to 100 pounds of seed per acre with a purity 0f.25 to 30 per cent. The seed is light and chaffy. Switchgrass, usually haying plump, heavy seed, is easily harvested with strippers. Yields of 30 to 50 pounds of seed per acre with a purity of 70 per cent may be obtained. </seg>
         <seg id="p104">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Western wheatgrass can be cut with a binder and run through a grain separator or it can be combined. It will give yields of 75 to 200 pounds of seed per acre with an average purity of about 70 per cent. Sand dropseed and tall dropseed combine easily. The latter two species seed abundantly and considerable quantities, par - ticularly of the sand dropseed, were harvested this year. Bromegrass, a tame grass, can be successfully harvested either by combining or cutting with a binder and threshing. T. B. Bowman of Albion told this audience last year how he harvested bromegrass seed. Since the seed of most of these grasses is light and chaffy it is especially important to make proper adjustments in the combine or threshing machine. Combines of the type which have a rubber - faced cylinder bar and rubber concaves are especially satisfactory, although other types have been successfully used. The wind should be cut down to a minimum. The speed of the cylinder should be reduced to 800 or 900 R.P.M. The sieves should be cleaned reg - ularly. The plants should be cut high so as to avoid the heavy foli - age on the lower parts of the stems. Too large a swath should not be taken where the growth is heavy. The cost of harvesting seed of these grasses will range from 3 to 25 cents a pound or less. Several farmers in southeastern Ne - braska harvested big bluestem seed for about 5 cents a pound this year. There is no satisfactory commercial machine available for harvesting buffalo grass seed. The easiest method of getting the seed is to sweep it into small piles with heavy stable push brooms on closely grazed pastures during the late fall months. Seed with a purity of about 70 per cent has been harvested in quantity in this way for 50 to 60 cents per pound. Some of the fairly level, closely grazed buffalo grass pastures of south central and south - western Nebraska offer a good source of seed. Harvesting seed of native grasses in pastures and meadows has certain disadvantages, some of which could be overcome if the seed were grown in pure stands under cultivation. This would be particularly true if the seed were grown on irrigated or subirriga - ted land or in the more favored parts of the state. The advanages of growing seed in pure stands as compared with harvesting seed from pastures and meadows might be summed up in this way: (1) seed could be harvested of a given species which does not occur in pure stands in nature meadows and pastures. Grasses normally grow in mixtures under natural conditions. (2) Grasses in "nature" produce wide fluctuations in the yield of seed from year to year. This yield could be more nearly stabilized if the grasses were grown </seg>
         <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION under favorable conditions. (3) The yield of seed from a given species of grass is usually spotted throughout the state. The yield may be high in one locality in one year and low during another year. The reverse may be true in another part of the state. Such erratic yields involve considerable expense to seed companies in having to locate the high yielding areas every year and move their equipment often for great distances into these areas. (4) Plant breeders are attempting to develop superior strains of these grasses just as has been done with other farm crops. In order to eventually put these superior strains into farm use, pure stands will have to be estab - lished and maintained to keep the varieties pure. Seeding Introduced and Native Grasses Stands of bromegrass and any other introduced Brasses such as timothy, orchard grass, and bluegrass can be most successfully established by fall seeding, i. c., August 20 to September 15 or by early spring seeding, i. c., about April 1. When the seeding of native grasses is considered," it should be recalled that there are two principal kinds of grasses, those making their growth in the spring and fall and those which are summer growing. Most of the native grasses are primarily summer growing grasses. The time' of seeding varies markedly for the two groups of grasses. ...-'.'. , . Western wheatgrass is about the only important native grass which behaves more like the introduced grasses such as bromegrass. Wheatgrass gives best results with early fall seeding or early spring seeding. It should be drilled to a depth of one-half inch. The needle grasses and mountain ricegrass, "a western Nebraska species, also give best results with early fall and early spring seedings. The other native grasses, viz., the bluestems, switchgrass, grama grasses, and buffalo grass give disappointing results if they are planted at the time recommended for bromegrass and western wheat - grass. If these native grasses are planted In the fall, they may ger - minate well if the moisture conditions are favorable but ordinarily do not become sufficiently established to survive the winter. Growth of these grasses usually ceases about October 1 or sooner. Early spring seeding i. c., during March or the first week in April is also unsatisfactory. Temperatures at this time of the year are too low for the germination of the seed of this particular group of grasses. Vigorous germination is delayed until the ground warms up. Ac - cordingly, delayed spring seeding i.e., during the latter part of April or the first part of May, is recommended. This delayed seed - ing has two advantages. The seed will germinate, immediately after planting if moisture conditions are favorable. The ground can be </seg>

College of Agricul - ture. Campus, i.lm-oln worked prior to seeding in order to destroy the early germinating weeds. The seed of some of the native grasses, such as the gramas, germinates rapidly and the seedlings emerge soon after planting. The seed of other grasses such as those of big bluestem, switchgrass, and buffalo grass germinate slowly. Ten days to two weeks are usually required for emergence of the seedlings. This delayed ger - mination and rather slow growth o f the seedlings offers difficult problems in the successful establishment of stands of native grasses. The delayed spring planting is recommended because the crop of weeds can be partially destroyed and the seeds are planted at a time when the germinating period can be reduced to a minimum amount of time. Another way in which to reduce the hazard of failure to get stands of grasses is to drill the seed in preference to broadcasting. Several of the grasses, viz., western wheatgrass, switchgrass, buffalo grass, and sand dropseed will drill satisfactorily. The seed of big blue stem, little bluestem, and the grama grasses is light and chaffy and considerable difficulty is experienced in seeding. Blue grama, side-oats grama, buffalo grass, and sand dropseed should be drilled very shallow, i.e., about one-fourth of an inch deep. Big bluestem and switchgrass give the best results when planted one-half inch deep. Experimental work at Lincoln and North Platte indicates that planting the grasses in spaced rows, thus permitting some culti - vation during the first year, is also promising. After the first year </seg>
         <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the grasses will spread by seed and in the case of some species by creeping underground stems and fill in the space between the rows. The establishment of stands of native grasses on cultivated land is not easy. Failures may result. As farmers learn .more about the proper methods and times of seeding these grasses, better results can be expected. It should be pointed out that considerably higher seed yields can be expected from pure stands of seeded native grasses than can be obtained from pastures and meadows. Propagating Buffalo Grass Buffalo grass has some characteristics which merit special con - sideration. It is difficult to obtain the seed in large quantities and the seed that can be obtained is expensive. Buffalo grass cannot be established with consistent success by artificial seeding. However, the plants do spread rapidly by means of creeping stems. A plant under favorable conditions can spread two feet or more in diameter during one season. The plants can also be readily transplanted as a sod. The following method of starting a field of buffalo grass is suggested in preference to artificial seeding. If seed is obtain - able, a small field could be successfully started with special care. Planting the seed into spaced rows with a drill, such as a grain drill or com planter, is recommended. During the first season some cul - tivation is advisable. The plants would spread rapidly and form a sod within a year or two. Sod transplants can then be moved to a larger field. Sod may also be obtained from local pasture lands. ot §§§!* 'ffialdtK S" SW '" r°WS tW° fe6t aPart in Sprll 's : </seg>
         <seg id="p108">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 108 The following recommendations are suggested with respect to sodding. Covering an entire area completely with sod is practical only for very small areas such as lawns or when the chief consid - eration is immediate results without regard to the costs Involved. A more sensible and economical procedure is to set out spaced pieces of sod. It is best to cut the sod with a sod cutter which makes a cleaner, more uniform cut than a plow. A satisfactory sod cutter may be built by bolting a sharpened U-shaped flat steel blade onto a frame. The blade should be so shaped as to cut a strip of sod 12 inches wide which a team of horses can pull. A rolling coulter may be used to cut the 12-inch strip into narrower strips. The strips may be cut crosswise with a sharp spade into small pieces. The pieces of sod should be cubes about 2 to 4 inches on a side. The sod may be set into the ground by hand but this is tedious and expensive. Successful stands have been established by merely drop - ping the pieces of sod on freshly cultivated land and pressing them level with the surface of the ground with a heavily weighted sur - face packer. Precaution should be taken to keep the pieces of sod with the grass side up. It is possible to use a wagon to which are fastened sheet-iron chutes dragging on the ground and thus form - ing an incline down which the pieces of sod may slide. Another implement which may be used is a manure spreader with the reel removed and platforms fastened to the sides of the rear end on which the men stand who are unloading. The driver can then oper - ate the apron-moving lever to keep a supply of sod constantly avail - able for unloading. The spacing of the transplanted sod 3 depends upon the location within the state, the amount of time and money to do the sodding, and the time within which a good stand is de - sired. Generally speaking, sods spaced 12 inches apart will grow - together during one year under dryland conditions of western Ne - braska. Here at Lincoln, sod has spread as rapidly as 2 or 3 feet in one year. The best time of the year to do the sodding is the month of May or the first part of June just after the field has been cleanly tilled to reduce weed infestation. Regrassing of Abandoned Land Abandoned cultivated land will return to permanent grass na - turally. It is well to seed a crop such as rye to reduce soil blowing or to leave a stubble prior to abandoning the land. The return to grass depends somewhat upon the time that the land was under cultivation and accordingly the extent to which roots and under - ground reproductive parts were destroyed during cultivation. Some research work has been done in Kimball county to de - termine how rapidly cultivated land returns to grass. The land following abandonment is usually covered with weeds 2 or 3 years, </seg>
         <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION following which annual grass weeds such as downy brome come in. Western wheatgrass begins to come in about the fourth year and during the next year or two there is a great increase of this grass, and other grasses begin to come in. During the filth and sixth years the land begins to provide considerable feed. By the tenth year the land is covered with a fairly good grass cover. The vege - tation on such land has not returned entirely to the original native state in this time, for this process takes many more years, but it is ¦reasonably productive. This illustration is merely an example of what occurred in Kimball county and the kind of plants and rate of regrassing will vary with different locations and conditions. Some artificial reseeding would undoubtedly hasten this process of grass - ing over of the land. Improving Grasses Through Selection The Experiment Station is carrying on intensive work to de - velop better strains of these grasses for particular localities and purposes. The progress thus far made indicates that the possibili - ties are good. The farmer has an opportunity to help in this pro - gram. It has been definitely established that there Is much varia - tion among plants of a given species within a field and also among plants of the same species from different localities. Accordingly, a farmer may harvest seed of a certain grass from his pasture lands which may prove to be definitely superior to seed bDtalned from another locality.

With timothy the leading legume is red clover, with bluegrass, white clover, with native grasses, the wild alfalfa, lead plant, sweet pea, Indian apple and other wild legumes, and with bromegrass the most satisfactory legume is alfalfa. When seeded alone, bromegrass is apt to become sodbound within a few years. It may attain a stunted yellowish-green color Indicating a lack of available nifcrogen that alfalfa will supply and thus stimu - late vigorous growth. Bromegrass provides many benefits if seeded with alfalfa, since it will cover the soil not occupied by the crowns of the legume and reduces soil loss. Later when the Bod is plowed the field is not subject to the severe gullying that frequently follows the plowing of a stand of old alfalfa. Grass roots decay more slow- </seg>

Old Fields Produce Seed Many stands of bromegrass that were established in Nebraska previous to the series of dry years are yet in good condition. Al - though growth in general is not as vigorous as with younger stands, crops of seed amounting to 300 pounds per acre were reported from old fields this year. The state highway department stripped and combined 29,000 pounds of seed from approximately 50 acres of select grass on the shoulders of our paved highways. This yield of over 500 pounds per acre is higher than what should be expected under average field conditions. Since the seed can be satisfactorily harvested with the newer combines or the ordinary grain binder and separator, old fields of bromegrass are returning a nice profit with clean seed retailing around 16 cents per pound. Threshing brome - grass with the ordinary grain separator is more successful if most of the wind is shut off from the fan, the number of rows of concave teeth reduced, and the back end of the machine lowered by digging holes for the rear wheels. ,™Broni e srass seed Production is a highly profitable enterprise. Yields of juu to 400 lbs. of seed per acre are common. (Courtesy of Soil Conservation Service) </seg>

Fall seedings usually get roots well into the subsoil by the time hot winds arrive the following summer, and enough top growth is generally produced to cover the soil and pre - vent excessive runoff from spring rains. Heavy runoff commonly takes place when the soil is not protected from puddling. The leafy - basal mat that young bromegrass forms, if grazed but lightly in - tercepts falling drops of rain prevents puddling, and keeps clear water penetrating the soil. In some instances fall seedings have produced several hundred pounds of seed the following summer. Erosion Sometimes a Problem on Neir Seedings Fields on sloping land that are clean tilled previous to seed - ing are subject to severe erosion. Seeding oats in the fall or spar - tan barley in the spring at about half the usual rate per acre, cuts down the period of time that severe erosion can take place. Last fall, in areas where moisture conditions were normal, good stands, without serious erosion, were obtained when the seedbed was pre - pared by merely disking tall stubble. It is preferable that the disk - ing be done on the contour. Erosion can be controlled on steep land that is to be pastured, by constructing level terraces placed about 30 feet apart. They will also accumulate moisture while the grass becames established. Plowing back furrows along contour lines while summer fallowing is an economical way to build such terraces. Tfien runoff water cannot attain much speed to wash the soil, because there is such a short distance between terraces in com - parison with the length of the entire slope. Mowing weeds or har - vesting seed will necessarily have to be done parallel to the terraces. Grasshoppers a Problem ' Bromegrass is such a palatable grass that grasshoppers will eat it in preference to weeds, foxtail or other annual weedy grasses. During the past season hoppers would sit in the shade of such weeds and "sap" young bromegrass by eating it off daily about the surface of the ground. If hoppers are numerous, conscientious eradication by poisoning should start during the previous year on and all around the field to be seeded. In the early summer of 1938, hoppers ate tender spring seedings of bromegrass more readily than poison bait and hopper catchers using old crankcase oil were used as a last resort to save seedings. </seg>
         <seg id="p112">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Thin Stands Soon Form Sod By the time bromegrass is a month old, several rhizomes or rootstocks may be sent outward from the original crown. This con - tinues until a solid sod is formed that may contain several tons of roots per acre in the upper four inches of soil. These aggressively spreading fibrous roots granulate the soil and thus make it more receptive of rainfall when brought into cultivation again. Successful Uses in Erosion Control Narrow strips of bromegrass which act as buffers to stop small gullies or "breaking over" of contour listed corn, were more suc - cessfully established when fall small grain, particularly wheat, was seeded on the adjoining fields. Under such conditions the grass seeding was in the center instead of the edge of the field where grasshopper injury is generally most severe. Fall seeded grass develops a good root system by the time wheat is harvested and seems to withstand abuse from the grasshoppers remaining in wheat stubble. Generally the lower edges of such buffer strips are sur - veyed on the contour, while on the upper side, silt is caught from listed rows as they depart from the true contour. Bromegrass, in terrace outlets at the University Farm, looks better today than the bluegrass or western wheatgrass in the other out - lets, if bromegrass is to be successfully used in controlling erosion in narrow confined terrace outlets, it is necessary to make the base of such outlet flat and thus let the water down in a ribbon-like stream. In terrace outlets the grass gets extra ordinary abuse from flowing water and consequently must be protected from severe trampling by livestock. Bromegrass has sucessfully controlled erosion in a few Ne - braska drainage ways for thirty years or more. It will stand con - siderable silting, once it has become established. Major field de - pressions and drainage ways have been successfully grassed by "Plowing in" the ditch and leaving several temporary "dead fur - rows" on each side to carry the runoff while the young grass be - comes established in the center. Summary In general, in central and eastern Nebraska fall seedings of bromegrass have been less susceptible to injury from hot winds and grasshoppers than spring seedings for the last two years. An ideal seedbed for bromegrass is a fine, firm, mellow, moist soil, free from weeds and weed seeds. Small fields of fall-seeded bromegrass suf - fered less grasshopper injury if surrounded by a field of wheat. Where moisture is favorable, contour disking and rolling of tall </seg>

         <seg id="p114">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Cultivation Costs Surprisingly Low- All of these important new developments have aided in the cutting down eradication costs. A few years ago we made a rather systematic study of the costs of the cultivation method. Insurance companies, the Federal Laud Bank and other farm owners prompted this because they were very much interested in how much it would cost to eradicate bindweed on a certain infested farm. On seven fields, running from an acre-and-a-half to something over six acres, the cost of eradication ranged from $3.80 per acre over a period of two years to $9.43 with and average of $7.03. Another larger field averaged about $10.00 per acre. That is much different than oiir old idea of 30 or 40 dollars per acre. We took into account the wear and tear of the machinery and the operators time, wMch we figured at 25 cents per hour. We found that the total cost per hour was 70 cents. It was possible to cultivate two acres per hour which makes the cost about 35 cents per acre for each cultivation. The number of cultivations averaged about eleven the first year and nine the last year. When we stop to consider that the bindweed roots usually go down into the soil as deep as 30 feet, it is no wonder that it is a real job to eradicate this pest. We do not know of any plant that soes down any deeper than this unless it should be alfalfa. We have found that we can hold bindweed in check by various cropping systems such as sorghum, alfalfa, and the various grasses. While these competitive crops thin out the bindweed it is not very likely that they will completely eradicate the pest. Before I close I would like to stress the importance of educa - tion. The new bindweed law enacted by the Nebraska legislature two years ago has helped a great deal to increase the interest in perennial weed eradication and thus has been of great educational value. The very best Extension meetings and those that are best attended have been on perennial weed eradication. Our pople are becoming weed conscious and they do desire to know what can be done. There have been times when it has been quite impossible for the Extension Service to furnish enough speakers to the various counties and weed organizations.

Organization of Bindweed District W. L. Klatt Nebraska Department of Agriculture Bindweed is by far the most dangerous and destructive weed in Nebraska. It is not only causing alarm in this state, but over a large part of the United States. Bindweed was first known in the United States about 150 years ago, originating in Europe and Asia. It was first recorded in Nebraska about 60 years ago, but during this time the weed has spread rapidly, and accord - ing to the information available, Nebraska has an estimated bindweed infestation of 400,000 acres. Every county has bindweed, and in some sections of the State the majority of the farms have bindweed infestations. Previous to the general interest and the bindweed consciousness In the people, the bindweed area in the State seemed to double itself about every five years. The Nebraska Unicameral Legislature, realizing the growing seriousness of the problem, enacted a new weed law in 1937. This law, aimed primarily at bindweed, also makes provisions for punc - ture vine, leafy spurge, and Canada thistle. That other noxious weeds may be controlled before becoming as serious as bindweed, the law provides that the Director of the Department of Agriculture and Inspection may declare other weeds noxious as conditions may warrant. Prevention Extremely Important The legislature, also realizing that prevention is a most im - portant consideration where the land is free from bindweed, not only provided for eradication under provisions of the law, but for control and prevention as well. The sale of seed, livestock feed, and other material containing noxious weed seed is prohibited until it has been processed in such a way as to remove or destroy the vi - ability of the weed seed. Representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Inspection interview owners and operators of eleva - tors, mills, seed houses, and public sale barns, explaining the por - tions of the weed law affecting them, and seeing that they comply with these provisions. There has been a marked interest on the part of the farmers, elevator man, and seedsmen in seed and feed inspection since the enactment of the law. One of the samples col- </seg>

         <seg id="p118">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A weed district organization assures a district-wide eradication program. A certain percent of each portion of infested land 'within the district is treated each year, leading to complete eradication. Under district organization all roads, railroad right-of-ways, ditches, and canals must be cleared of noxious weeds at the expense of con - trolling agencies. Weed districts are locally controled and are ad - iuiiiistred by supervisors elected by the landowners of the area. Ex - pense of organization and eradication is assessed according to bene - fits received. It is supposed that in nearly all cases each land - owner will assume the responsibility of eradicating noxious weeds on his land. Organized districts also receive the benefits of state inspection, supervision, and cooperation. Organization of a District Briefly, the steps to be followed in the organization of a dis - trict are: Fifty-one per cent of the resident landowners or persons owning 60% of the land in any contiguous body of land not less than one square mile in area of rural land, or one block square in a municipality, may petition for organization. The petition must include and describe all the lands to be in the district, names of landowners, and those interested in the lands with their places of residence. The petition is filed with the county clerk in the county wherein the district is located. If the clerk finds the petition in proper form, a copy is sent to the Director of the Department of Agriculture and Inspection. The Director causes a preliminary sur - vey to be made of the lands described in the petition, and with the aid of the State Weed Advisory Committee makes a recommendation that petition be granted in full, in part, or that it be denied. The recommendation and maps of the survey are then filed with the county clerk. The clerk notifies all landowners and interest holders by registered mail and by publication of a hearing to be held on the petition before the county supervisors. At the hearing objec - tions and evidences for and against the formation of a weed district are heard. The board of supervisors, having the original petition, the recommendation of the Director of the Department of Agriculture and Inspection, and the results of the hearing, proceeds to make a written finding on the formation of the district. If the formation of a district is ordered, the landowners are called together to elect three or five supervisors who administer the affairs of the district. Even under weed district organization community spirit and bindweed consciousness are necessary to insure successful eradication and control practices. The size of a district should be somewhat regulated by these factors, as well as the extent of existing bindweed infestation. Thus far four weed eradication districts have been organized </seg>

THE LOOKING GLASS BINDWEED DISTRICT J. C. Peterson, Lindsay, President *&gt;, Th* Lookln&amp; Glass bindweed eradication district is located in the northwest corner of Platte County and the farm on which I am located is near the center of this district. The man who homesteaded this farm sold It to my father 57 years ago. . The first bindweed I ever saw on this place was 22 years ago. For several years little thought was given this plant which appeared n small patches on several farms. Some years later when we learned the name and nature of the plant, advice was sought from the Col - le o e^f Agriculture and attempts at eradication were begun Dif - ficu ties were encountered because of bindweed infestation on ad - joining farms and roads. Therefore, farmers found themselves handi - capped in coping with this weed. hv ? ?A3 St ' 1933&gt; a Pe"tion waa 6iTC^ted which was signed by about 75% of the resident voters In Walker township in an at - tempt to organize a bindweed eradication district, under the law passed^by the legislature that year.

On request, our county agent arranged with the state extension service to hold an educa - tional meeting in a hall which is located in a central place in our community. On the evening that it vras t6 he held, the weather was unfavorable and the attendance was small. Our county agent, Mr. Spilker, who was bringing Mr. Srb of the state extension service, and Mr. Klatt, State Weed Supervisor, to conduct the meeting, had difficulties in reaching the designated place. Even though it was late there was sufficient interest to carry on a short discusion of the new bindweed law and the eradication of various weeds. Our second attempt to hold a meeting resulted in an atten - dance of about 75. After hearing the bindweed law explained, sev - eral farmers expressed their opinion favoring the formation of a bindweed eradication district. The meeting adjourned without fur - ther action because of lack of volunteers to circulate the petition. It seemed that our efforts were coming to naught. A few men re - mained after most of them had gone and talked over the apparent results of the meeting. Some of these expressed their disappoint - ment over the fact that the efforts to form a district were in vain, and volunteered to circulate the petition in the six sections where there was the most interest. When these signatures were being collected, men on adjoining land, asked to take the petition to get the signatures of their neigh - bors, thereby extending the proposed district. When the circula - tion was well advanced, the interested men gathered one evening at ihe Looking Glass schoolhouse. At that meeting 1 a chairman, sec - retary, and a treasurer were elected, their terms to expire when the district was approved or rejected. The name, Looking Glass was chosen for the proposed eradication district. It was decided to raise, by voluntary subscription, the $50.00 fund which must be deposited with the county clerk when the petition, signed by not less than 51 of the resident landowners, or owners of 60% of the land, is filed with the county clerk of the county in which the dis - trict is located. By the time the petition was filed with the county clerk, the district contained approximately 81 sections of land, in a perfectly square tract. The preliminary survey was then made by the State Depart - ment, and 518 acres of bindweed infestation on the farms was re - ported. On a date set by the county clerk, a hearing was held before the county board of supervisors, who after hearing the evi - dence presented, approved the formation of the district without a dissenting vote.

By the increased plant - ing of sorghums, Nebraska once more takes an important sten for ward toward a more stable agriculture. The increased interest in sorghums in recent years has been </seg>
         <seg id="p122">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE almost phenomenal. The use of this crop has begun to put a new face on the agriculture of the state. One would need to go back many years to find a similar comparison of change in cropping prac - tices within the state. It is interesting to review the history of these changes as they have come about. It seems that the progress of agriculure in Nebraska has not been marked so much by a gradual movement forward as it lias by the almost sudden taking of great forward steps that have caused fundamental and lasting improve - ment in our systems of farming. Going back to the records of the early nineties, we find that at that time most of the wheat sown In the state was of the spring varieties. It was about that time that the millers discovered they could make good bread from the hard red winter wheat that was just getting a start. Its yield superiority to spring wheat over most of the state was soon recognized and the acreage increased from less than a million in 1900 to over three million in 1913. Without Turkey red wheat and similar types which came into use later, the prosperity of much of our state could not have developed as it has. Nearly at the same time came alfalfa. Introduced into the southwestern part of the state this crop spread rapidly- until, Ne - braska led all states in the union in acreage of this crop. It is not necessary to describe the tremendous importance of alfalfa in Nebraska's agricultural progress. Without it Nebraska could never have become the great livestock feeding center that it has. Additional Mew Crops Appear Just at the turn of the century, another new crop, Kherson oats, began to make headway. Far superior to the later types of oats then being grown, this variety brought from Russia to Nebraska in 1898 by Professor T. L. Lyon of the Nebraska Experiment Station, soon spread over the whole state. Kherson oats and selections of it, or similar types, are now the predominating varieties grown in all midwestern states. In more recent .years, we have seen the almost sudden accep - tance of sweet clover as a soil-building and pasture crop. It is interesting to recall that at one time the legislature of a neighboring state considered the advisability of declaring sweet clover to be a noxious weed and proposing penalties for anyone who would plant it. Ip until 1920 no recognition was given to this crop by the agri - cultural statistics of the state. In that year, 30,000 acres were re - ported. In the short period of ten years this acreage had increased nearly forty-fold, or well over one million acres in 1930. This crop has been a vital factor in the maintenance of productivity of the soil of our state, particularly for eastern Nebraska. </seg>

         <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE are located in the eastern half of the state and were honored at the finish-up achievement meeting held at Omaha on November 22. These men were recognized for outstanding achievement in the 1938 Past - ures-Forage-Livestock Program at Omaha on November 22, 1938. They are left to right: E. M. Edgar, Colfax County; Fred H. Krueger. Thayer fountv; and \V. C. Klingman, Deuel County. First of all, the following Is the average of the twenty-two cases I have mentioned. These 22 farmers operated an average of 612 acres. They have an average of 6.9 horses, 72.6 cattle, 102.6 hogs and 2.3 sheep. Taking this on the basis of livestock units (one live - stock unit is equivalent to 1 horse, 2 colts, 1 mature cow, 2 calves, 5 hogs, or 7 sheep), each of these farmers had an average of 85.9 livestock units. All but two of them had permanent pasture, and they had an average of 22 3 acres permanent pasture per farm. Everyone used at least some temporary pasture. Nineteen used small grain, chiefly rye. Seven grazed first year sweet clover; four utilized second year sweet clover; fifteen used sudan. The total acreage of temporary pasture per farm was 24.2 acres. The total acreage of permanent and temporary pastures was 247.2 acres. Taking this on the basis of livestock units we find that there were 2.9 acres of pasture per animal unit. In other words, this was the same as having 2.9 acres per cow or horse. This may help to explain why the permanent pastures on these farms were, generally speaking, coming back in good shape and why the livestock was in excellent condition. Sixteen of these farmers used silage and the amount of silage </seg>
         <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION 125 per farm was 138 tons. All but five of the farmers had some al - falfa hay. All used sorghums of some type. The total amount of dry roughage on each of these farms equalled 205 tons. This allows a total of 2.1 tons silage.and 3.1 tons dry roughage per animal unit (not including hogs). ' : The • amount of grain raised on these farms was surprisingly high. The least grain raised on any farm was 500 bushels. The most was 9,225 bushels. There was an average ol 1,257 busnelß corn; 129 bushels grain sorghum; and a total of 3,246 bushels of grain per farm. Eight of the farms had grain sorghums. It was also interesting to note that only one farmer in this group plans to sell feed and this is oats for seed. On the contrary, 18 plan to buy. Furthermore, there will be practically no roughages sold off of these farms. Therefore, you can see that these farmers are little worried about the low prices of roughages or even the fact that some of the feed grains are relatively low at present. Establishing Permanent Pasture In the establishment of pastures, Joseph E. Lorenz of Saline County did an outstanding job. He summer fallowed, throughout the 1937 season, a 15-acre permanent pasture which had been "killed out". This was ridged so as to hold the water. Before seeding last spiring the ground was listed on the contour In between the ridges. Alfalfa and brome seed was scattered over this washboard effect and the ground was rolled. Now Mr. Lorenz has an excellent brome-alfalfa pasture on ground which will hold all the rainfall. He has demonstrated that it may be practical to give up the use of the permanent pasture ground for a year to store up moisture and pre - pare a good seedbed in order to increase chances of success with seeding. ';:: : ' In Hall county near Doniphan, Mr. Albert P. Alber did an out - standing piece of work with western wheatgrass. He combined seed from a. field In his neighborhood, then on the 25th of September, 1937, he seeded the grass. Plenty of weeds came in this spring, but he ¦controlled these through judicious mowing. He now reports that he lias "a wonderful stand of wheatgrass". This will provide a good pasture for Mr. Alber in a territory where new permanent pastures are not easy to get. .. ••.'.."; ¦ .¦ - : Still another successful method of getting pastures was demon - strated by Paul H. Miller in Adams county. Ten years ago he plant - ed fifteen acres of badly eroded land to cane. This ground was not disturbed after that and no grass seed was planted on it. At first a good many weeds came in, but this year for the first time he has a a good stand of grass. This process, of course, is slow but may have </seg>

Proper man - agement is one of the best ways of maintaining and restoring pas - tures where any grass is left. In Thayer county, Mr. Fred H. Krueger had extensive damage done to his permanent pastures by the extremely dry years. He reduced his livestock numbers and pasture-furrowed most of his rolling pasture land. He has had a wonderful recovery on his pas - tures and soon will be back in the livestock business on his former basis. Perhaps farmers in eastern Nebraska could gain a good deal by studying the methods employed in the sandhills. Mr. R. M. Ross of Cherry county, one of the cooperators this year, has close to 20,000 acres of pasture. His grazing land is in excellent condition and he keeps it this way through rotation and deferred grazing. This year, for example, he rested 3,220 acres. Returns From Pasture Land One of the points often discussed in connection with pastures is whether or not pastures and forage crops in general give proper returns to the farmer. Generally speaking, many farmers will tell you that good grass is their greatest resource on the farm. One or two specific examples of returns from forage crops may be of interest in this connection. In Nemaha county, Mr. Lloyd Nichols seeded a brome-alfalfa pasture in the fall of 1936. This year because of ample feed from temporary pastures, he did not need his bromegrass pasture. He left it stand for seed. He combined 1,500 pounds of clean seed from 8 acres. He sold 1,200 pounds of this for $240.00. He held back 300 pounds which he seeded on additional ground this fall. This gave him a gross income of over $30.00 per acre for seed and he still had his pasture off of the brome late this summer and this fall. On this same farm, wheat this year produced 10 bushels per acre. You can see that at the market price of 50tf, the gross return from wheat was $5.00 per acre. The cost of harvesting the brome was very little more than harvesting the wheat and obviously there was no seedbed preparation or seeding cost for the current year. On his farm in northern Jefferson county, Mr. John Scheve has o4H acres of fine wild grass pasture. Many would question the ad - visability of this much pasture land on an 800-acre farm In that part of the state. Mr. Scheve does not feel this way. Perhaps the following explains why. In November of 1935, he bought 46 heifers ft $6.25 per hundred pounds. These calves were wintered on oal straw, sorgo fodder, 2 pounds of alfalfa hay, and 1 pound of oats </seg>

Temporary Pastures From the figures I gave you a while ago, you will notice that temporary past ures played a very important role in the p"o g ram S of ithe outstanding cooperators. Bn™ Mr. B:'M.

They are left to right; Max W. Junkin, Gosper County; Karl Hanson, Clay County; and John Strangman, Franklin County The use of small grain for silage is not generally recognized in this state. This year, Mr. W. A. Peterson of Clay county put up and fed rye silage. He secured 14 tons of silage off of a four-acre field of rye. He cut it when it was in the stiff-dough stage, although he believes it should have been harvested earlier. He cut it with a regular grain binder, taking about one-half of a swath at a time. He mixed water and 420 pounds of molasses with the rye. He figured it cost $8 to put up the silage and the molasses cost ?5; thus, the cost of 14 tons of silage was ?13 over and above the cost of growing the rye. The silage was put up on June 14 and feeding was started on June 28. Mr. Peterson is a dairyman and found that his Holstein cows took the feed readily. He fed his cattle on this feed for two months and states that he saved six weeks of pasture at a time when his permanent pasture was very short. Estimating the yield of grain, </seg>

Just how significant this matter of small grain silage will be is not known at present. Some of the advantages are obvious. Often particularly in the South Platte section, extreme summer heat or other factors practically ruin the yield of grain; thus the crop could be salvaged as silage. The silo is usually empty by the spring of the year and thus one more drouth.insurance feature can be had by raising small grain for silage. Permanent pasture could be Im - proved by keeping stock off at this critical season of the year. A Balanced Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program In closing, I presume that many of you noticed the editorial in one of the Lincoln papers last evening. It pointed out. that in a survey based on 20 southeastern farms the average livestock on hand included 2 head of cattle, 1 pig, and 1% horses. Needless to say, this is a critical situation, but perhaps these 20 farmers can get some help by studying conditions on one of the farms included in our Pasture-forage-Livestock program which is located in south - eastern Nebraska. In this case, I refer to Noah Nispel in Jefferson county. He farms 400 acres in an area hard hit by drouth. He now has 7 horses, 30 hogs, and 43 cattle. He creep feeds calves and this year started 19 on grain feed in May. Calves were weaned in early November and then started on full feed of corn. He has 90 acres of excellent native grass on which grazing was delayed until June 15. He used 21 acres of temporary pasture. He has on hand 12 tons of alfalfa, 50 tons, of wild hay, 140 tons of silage, and 65 tons of other dry roughage. He also has 4,400 bushels of grain. PROBLEMS IN SOUGHTOI PRODUCTION! A. F.

The (deal seedbed for sorghum has an abundance of stored moisture with the soil warm, mellow and in good tilth. The optimum soil temperature for good germination seems to run be - tween 750 and 80° F., with a moisture content in the silt loam soil at Hays of from 16 to 18 per cent in the immediate region where the seed is dropped. When the warm, mellow, moist soil can be molded into a ball with the hands but will still crumble readily, conditions can be said to be ideal for seeding sorghum. Poor &gt; Presented at the annual meeting of the Nebraska Crop Growers 1 germination may be expected when the sorghum seed is dropped into a cold, wet, clammy soil. Under such planting conditions the soil will often bake or dry out before the seed can germinate; or if heavy .rains follow planting, the seed will disintegrate in the soil. Even though the conditions which determine an ideal seedbed may be well known it is often difficult to attain the high standards outlined above for the reason that planting is usually done during the early part of June, which is also the time when the heaviest rain - fall of the year may occur, making the crop subject to all of the hazards incident to heavy precipitation. Land on which wheat has been grown and where there is a good residue ot stubble will usually make an excellent seedbed for sorghum. One .reason for this is that there is a long period between the removal of the wheat crop and sorghum planting, to build up stored moisture. Perhaps the most common way of planting sorghum, or any row crop, is to list at planting time without any previous tillage; but the yields for this method have been 25 to 50 percent lower than when more preparation has been given the land previous to seeding. Yields firom different methods of seedbed preparation at the Hays station are shown in Table 1. </seg>

Sorghums may be considered a "tripple threat" crop in that they are resistant to damage from drouth, grasshoppers, and hail. There are 13,608 feet or rows in an acre when the rows are 4 0 inches apart. A full stand of plants spaced 6 inches apart in the row would require 26-136 plants. Such a stand is generally satis - factory for most sorghum varieties especially if grown for grain, although such a variety as Dwarf milo tends to yield higher when the plants are spaced 12 to 15 inches apart in the irow.

It is neither feasible no desirable to drill holes in the plates so small as to drop but one seed at a time, for such holes are quickly clogged. If three or four seeds can get through at once, and the holes are reamed out on the under side, there is little danger of stoppage Holes eleven-sixty-fourths of an inch in diameter are satisfactory for small seeds of the Sumac type; for seeds of the kafir type holes three-sixteenths of an inch.in diameter, and for seeds such as feterita and milo holes nine-thirty-secohds of Jan inch in diameter are satis - factory. -.¦.:-¦ The planter can be adjusted for the desired rate of planting by driving over a hard road surface with the planting unit engaged.

Corn plates should not be used in planting sorghum, as the stands invariably will be too thick if conditions are at all favorable for germination. The Time to Plant The time to plant sorghums depends on the time normally re - quired to mature the variety .A good rule is to attempt to plant a variety at such a time that the fruiting period will come at a time 1 when the temperatures and rainfall are most favorable, and to fur - ther permit the crop to mature before frost where grain is desired.

Late forage varieties should develop sufficiently to produce satisfactory bundle or silage feed even if the seed has not fully matured. Cultivation of Sorghums The cultivation for sorghum is so nearly identical with that required for corn that there is little need to further discuss the subject. Sorghum plants as a rule are a little slower than corn in reaching sufficient height just after emergence for the first cultiva - tion, which sometimes makes the control of weed growth a little more difficult than for corn. As already stated earlier in this paper, pre-tillage operations before actual planting are highly desirable, not only in building up stored .moisture from late spring rains, but in destroying from one to three crops of weeds which otherwise might get out of control. This practice is followed at the Hays Station. </seg>

Opinions vary considerably on this point, but the type of season under which the crop was grown, the avail - able moisture in the seedbed as the crop reached maturity, the near - ness to the frost period, are factors which govern. Definite rules can not be laid down but some general principles may be stated. _ It is generally assumed that when the grain of a forage sorghum has reached the hard dough stage in a-normal season of growth that it has reached the best stage forsilage. The amount of sugar in the stalks then be at its maximum. However, it has been observ - ed at the Hays station that if this stage is reached, and if additional heavy fall rains occur, and if the weather remains unseasonably warm the stalks tend to build up even a greater amount of sugar Under such a condition the haste to harvest dotfe not need be so great A frost </seg>
         <seg id="p136">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or light freeze above 30° does not detract from the feeding value of the sorghum, except there may be a slight loss of leaves which are less valuable than the stems in nutritive value. In general, for bundle feed it is sometimes better to run the risk of a slight frost if the crop is growing good up to such a period, than to cut too early in September. Early cutting tends to let the stalks dry, re - ducing the palatability and value of the fodder. Heavy rains may also cause spoilage in the shocks. Forage sorghums should not be left standing so as to be in dan - ger of being caught by temperatures as low as 25° F. At approx - imately such a temperature the cell structure of the plant seems to burst, causing in some way a rather rapid chemical change which as observed at the Hays station has not always left the crop in the best condition for either silage or bundle feed; the trouble being that the material may sour. On the other hand, if the crop has reached maturity with all of the subsoil moisture exhausted, little will be gained by delaying nan-vest. Frequently a forage variety may reach considerable growth but fail to mature seed because of a short season. Under such a condition it is probably best to delay the cutting as late as possible, but ahead of a heavy freeze. A forage sorghum which fails to mature grain often makes excellent bundle feed. Storing .Sorghum Feeds A good silo offers the best medium for the storage of sorghum feeds aside from the fact that a considerable investment is involved along with the filling expense. On the other hand the chemical processes involved by ensiling make possible the better utilization of some of the crude fibers and o£ any grain present that is not so readily digestible in the dry form. Also there is less waste of feed and greater convenience in handling during Inclement weather. For these reasons, higher acre gains may be expected from silage than from bundle feed, when the basic feed is of the same content. Good silage carries around 70 to 77 percent of moisture as does a vigorous growing normal standing plant before it is cut and ready for the silo. If for some reason the material for the silo has lost a con - siderable amount of the natural moisture within the plant, before being processed, additional water must be added through the blower. The stacking of sorghum fodder or stover is sometimes a prob - lem when the crop Is full of juice and when the fall weather is damp and rainy. Under such conditions the drying process is slow, and sometimes all that can be done is to leave the material in the field in shocks, feeding same from day to day as needed. This is particularly true if the material is more or less kept damp by atmos - pheric moisture. If the atmospheric moisture is not so excessive as to </seg>
         <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA' CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION cause molding, bundle feeds lying in the open and in shocks are often molding, bundle feeds lying in the!open and in shocks are often kept more palatable by being so subjected. Palatability is always enhanced when the moisture content is around 40 to 50 percent. Low winter temperatures hovering around 100 f. followed by wind and seasonal dry winter weather rapidly reduces the moisture con - tent of all feeds, slowly causing a loss in palatability. Sorghum hay, etover and fodder feeds can be stacked fairly safely with a moisture content of from 25 to 35 percent, but stack - ing must not be done when the .material is damp from dew or slight rainfall because of the danger of molding. Fodder bundles which are sweet and somewhat sappy may generally be fairly safely placed in long narrow ricks approximately three bundles wide or a width of 6 to 8 feet. The middle row of bundles should be kept higher than the outer rows of bundles to shed rain. Again such bundles should never be ricked when dew or external moisture is present on the material because of the danger of molding. As long as the out - side surface of the stems is free from external moisture, the high concentrated sugar content within the stems tends to act as a pre - servative in much the same manner as sugar in jelly made by the housewife. Such ricks should, however, be watched against danger of excess heating and molding and should be well topped so as to shed rain. The secret of preventing excess heating and molding seems to lie in keeping the ricks narrow and as free from added atmospheric moisture not naturally present within the stalks them - selves as possible, and to do the stacking when the weather is dry. Sometimes a slight heating and chemical process takes place turning the stacked feeds to a tobacco brown color in much the same manner as occurs at times in stacked alfalfa hay. Livestock greatly relish the bundle feed in such a condition and do very well on it. Stover or butts from the drier grain sorghum varieties are sometimes improved by such a treatment and made more palatable because of the fact that the outside shell of the stalks is softened' by the process/as well as by the flavor added to it. We do not yet know the best method for developing the tobacco brown condition in stacked sorghum feed, as usually it occurs accidentally; but if carried too far this may also run into a moldy condition which great - ly lowers the value of the feed. The whole process could well be made a carefully conducted experimental study. Furthermore it seems to be best to utilize before the end of winter all feeds that have turned to a tobacco brown color, for when such feeds dry out, palatability may be lost. Again, when further subjected to outside moisture and air, the tendency is for the material to mold. </seg>
         <seg id="p138">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Harvesting a Grain Crop of Sorghum There are four general methods of harvesting sorghum for grain: d) Hand topping, (2) cutting with a row binder or corn binder, (3i topping with a header, and (4) heading with a combine, including several modifications. The oldest and simplest but the least efficient method is that of cutting heads by hand in the field from the standing stalks. This method is too expensive and tedious to be recommended, but may be justifiable when the acreage is small and when time and labor costs are not important factors. By this method one man with a team and wagon can harvest from l\i to 2 acres a day, depending on the thickness of the stand and the yield of the crop. Hand harvest - ing is facilitated by having thin stands so that the heads will grow relatively large. The topped heads should be stacked in narrow ricks to cure. Dwarf varieties such as Colby or Day milo can not easily be topped by hand. The row binder, or corn binder, is the most satisfactory machine for havesting when high quality seed for planting purposes is de - sired and when both grain and stover are wanted. The crop is cured in shocks of 12 to 15 bundles and should be threshed as soon as thoroughly cured. The entire bundle may sometimes be put through the threshing machine, or if the bundles are to long the heads may be cut off. A cheese-knife arrangement consisting of a long blade fastened to a suitable frame on the wagon rack or barge is satisfactory for topping the bundles. When the wagon is loaded the heads are taken to a centrally located machine to be threshed or are ricked in preparation for threshing. The combine also may be used for threshing by moving from shock to shock to thresh the heads as they are topped by a special sickle bar attach - ment on the platform. The great advantage of cutting with a binder, regardless of how the bundles are threshed, is that the standing crop can be har - vested before frost and generally before any lodging 1 takes place This system of harvesting usually gives an excellent quality of grain which keeps well in storage. An early maturing grain sorghum such as Early Kalo can read - ily be cut with a binder in advance of frost. With several weeks of favorable drying weather the bundles can sometimes be run through the threshing machine in the same manner as wheat bundles.

Two men with a header can harvest and rick about 13 acres a day, assuming that half of the time is taken to unload. Sorghum may be harvested more cheaply and more rapidly with the header than with the row binder or by hand, but the loss of grain is usually greater when the header is used. Special kafir headers or row headers have been devised which can be attached to an ordinary wagon box and driven by a chain and sprocket gear bolted to the rear wagon wheel. These machines are satisfactory when the crop is uniform in height and when no lodg - ing has occurred. The row header will harvest from 4 to 5 acres a day, which is more economical and faster than harvesting by hand The heads are ricked in the usual manner. The Combine Method of Harvesting The combine method of harvesting grain sorghum is the desire of almost every farmer growing the crop for grain. This is largely due to the fact that power machinery is available on the farm, and the one operation eliminates labor and expense except that the de - preciation and investment invoved are important factors to be con - sidered. Also, the number of work horses on the farms is now so depleted that frequently there is not enough animal power on the farms to carry on. the harvesting and threshing of sorghums with horse machinery. .. ' : When conditions are favorable the dwar£ varieties can be har - vested and threshed more efficiently with a combine than by any other method, except that the quality of the grain may be somewhat impaired. Favorable conditions for combining occur when the crop </seg>
         <seg id="p140">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE has ripened normally by late September, preferably during a period of dry weather followed by a killing freeze where the temperatures have dropped as low as 25° F. A few days of drying weather after a severe freeze usually will reduce the moisture content of the grain sufficiently to eliminate much of the danger of heating in storage. While sorghum can be combined with a moisture content of grain as high as 15 to 20 percent, such grain cannot be stored unless it is put through special artificial driers to reduce the moisture content to 12 percent or lower. Conditions unfavorable for the use of the combine are deferred maturity of the crop due to rainy weather and late killing frost which permit the sorghum to continue growing until the last of October Frequently in the more humid regions a light rainfall in November may raise the moisture content of the grain on the standing heads as much as 5 percent. When this external moisture is once absorbed by the standing grain it dries very slowly and causes trouble in storage when combined. This delay may also throw the combining of the sorghum into severe and inclement weather during the early winter. Recently in northwestern Kansas there has been a tendency to top and rick even combine sorghums to avoid this difficulty. Sorghum plants allowed to stand in the field until after a heavy freeze and drying weather become subject to lodging and sometimes heavy losses. The dwarf combine types such as Colby milo and Wheatland have greater resistance to lodging than the somewhat tal - ler types such as Early Kalo. Lodging, however, is not entirely due to height of the plants. Causes of Lodging. It has more recently been discovered at the Hays station that much of the lodging occurring in combine sorghum is due to a disease known as "Weak neck". It was first noticed during the fall of 1937 but more fully observed during the fall of 1938 and found over most of the sorghum belt. As far as is known the first attack of the disease does not occur until after the grain has formed. The disease begins at the uppermost tip of the head. At first it progresses rapidly downward to the upper node of the stalk, or may continue to the base of the plant. Breaking of the head at the upper node of the stalk or at the base may occur. The disease tends to shrivel the grain and causes disappointment in yields although the grain crop is never a total failure from this cause. When the prematurely ripened grain is ready for harvest the disease will have reached its climax, resulting as stated above in lodged plants and heads which show lack of luster and reduced grain </seg>
         <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION yields. The cause of the disease is not known, nor is there any stss:" "¦«»»«- '«• «• ¦«• £z z Another cause of lodging is drouth. When any variety has made a rapid growth and has developed more or less grain and reach - es the maturity stage with no subsoil moisture to further sustain the Plant, it.becomes readily subject to lodging from weakness near the base. A variety such as Early Kalo seems to be more highly sub - ject to this type of lodging than to "Weak neck" as observed over a wide region this fall. Many varieties of sorghum are subject to this type of lodging, and if left standing until after a heavy freeze may readily go down with the first high wind. Varieties of sor - ghum which from normal growth go into ripening- periods with plenty of subsoil moisture or moisture from late fall rains, are less subject to drouth lodging. : Keport of the 1938 Sorghum Variety Tests R. L. Cushing-, Agriculture College The Testing Program Before a variety of sorghum, whether it be developed by the Nebraska Experiment Station or introduced from another state, can be recommended to farmers its worth must be established by exhaus - tive testing. The quality of the grain or forage must be known. Its degree of resistance to insect pests and diseases must be observ - ed. And above all, its adaptation to the conditions under which it is to be grown must be determined. The information regarding regional adaptation is often the most difficult to obtain and takes the most.time, because, as yet, there is no method of getting this data except by actually growing the varieties in the different .regions. In 1938 there were major tests at the Lincoln and North Platte Experiment Stations which included thirty and twenty varieties re - spectively. To furnish reliable data for other parts of the state eight tests, each having seventeen varieties, were planted in as many counties by a representative of the Experiment Station. Air these tests were thinned to provide comparable stands between varieties They were carefully harvested and .moisture samples were taken to permit accurate calculation of forage yields. In addition thirty - two tests were planted, cared for, and harvested by county agricul - ture agents. The location of all 1938 tests reported in this paper are shown in figure 1. ¦ </seg>

Highland shows a slight advantage in yield over Early Kalo in Box Butte county, while on the average, Improved Coes yielded less than Early Kalo. It must be noted, however, that the first fall frost in this region was approximately a month later this year than usual. In normal seasons, Improved Coes and Highland, both of which.are earlier in maturity than Early Kalo, may be expected to make a comparatively better showing. Region IV—ln this region, Hegari, Kalo, Early Kalo, and West - ern Blackhull Kafir are ranked in order according to yield of grain. Grain sorghum will probably be of little importance in this, the northeastern, part of the state, because of the relative dependability of corn.

J The wide margin by which sorgos have consistently outyielded corn for forage is well known so ( that forage yields will not be pre - sented in detail. During a 12-year period, 1925-1938, Atlas sorgo ..Mjr averaged 4.40 tons of cured forage per acre as compared with 2.06 tons from corn at the Experiment Station at Lincoln The data from cooperative tests point to the same fact, that during years of limited rainfall, Atlas sorgo, Leoti sorgo! or Early Sumac sorgo may be expected to yield approximately twice as much forage as corn. Summary There are many disadvantages to sorghum production. Yet in spite of these disadvantages the greater dependability of sorghum has been responsible for a large increase in the acreage of the crop in Nebraska. Last year the total acreage in the state increased from 489,200 acres to 913,754. The increase in grain sorghum acre - age alone was from 183,641, to 437,857 acres between 1937 and 1938. It is interesting to note that the greater part of the 1938 sor - ghum acreage, 54 per cent is located in region 11. The results from the 1938 tests demonstrated that when mois - ture is a limiting factor in crop production, adapted varieties of grain sorghum can consistently produce more grain than corn The data further indicates that Early Kalo, Sooner, and Kalo are the best adapted grain sorghum varieties for most parts of Nebraska. . For silage, Atlas again demonstrated that it can produce good yields in all parts of the state. Seed yields from Atlas however are l ow , particularly in the western and northern regions. Early Sumac i has also produced good yields of silage but seed yields have generally been even lower than Atlas. In those regions where Atlas s too late to consistently produce seed, yields of Leoti indicate that is is the most suitable variety now available. ¦ •:¦.' ¦: ¦¦ ¦-¦¦¦•¦ -¦' •' ¦ ¦ : ¦¦¦ - '''.'¦{ ¦' '-.'. </seg>
         <seg id="p150">ItKPORT OF .VEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SORGHUMS ON MY FARM H. L. Wahlgren, Elk City For many years we have raised some sorghums on our farm but mostly for forage alone. Black Amber, White kafir and sudan f;rass were what we had for the most part. These were either put in the silo or shocked and fed in the bundle, or chopped and fed dry. We also used Sudan grass for pasture. Some of the kafir we had was uncertified seed purchased for Atlas sorgo. Then we secured some genuine Atlas seed, and even though moisture conditions were not the best, we raised a real crop of forage and a fair grain crop and began to be really interested in sorghums. We feed practically all we raise and it was a real thrill to harvest as much feed per acre as we did from this first field of Atlas. We cut this with a corn binder, shocked it and later removed the heads with a heavy knife fastened to a cutting bar mounted on one of our feed wagons which are similar to a header barge. Our thought was to have the grain for seed but damp weather combined with low temperatures lowered the vitality to a point where we didn't feel like offering it, but it was still perfectly good feed and we fed it to our breeding ewes. I would place our yield of this at about 15 tons in the form of silage. Before this we had used corn and less productive sorghums for silage and dry roughage and were well pleased with Atlas. Need - less to say we stayed with Atlas the next year, and in spite of a prolonged dry spell, during which time it stood practically dormant, we got another fine crop when rain finally came to Start it growing again, although the grain did not mature well enough to germinate well. Starts Growing Grain Sorghums After a couple of near failures with corn for either grain or roughage and seeing how well Atlas filled our silos in the worst of seasons, we began to wonder if perhaps grain sorghums might be a good thing to turn to for at least a part of our normal cam acreage. So in 1937 after consulting with our agronomy department, I planted 50 acres of Early Kalo and increased my atlas to 40 acres. I suppose most all of you are familiar with Atlas but not every - one with early Kalo. Fo.r those I should like to say it is rather a combine type with not a great deal of foliage and growing three to possibly four feet tall with fairly long open heads growing well out of the boot or above the top leaf. This makes it possible to cut the heads with a combine or header without getting so much of the leaf. This fifty acres was cornstalk ground which we disced from time to time to kill pigweeds of which we have plenty on our black upland soil. Our thought in this was that sorghums didn't stand </seg>
         <seg id="p151">1 NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION weed competition during.the first couple of weeks as does corn so we were anxious to cut down the weed population before planting Then we listed about twenty acres on about the twelfth of June and the balance on the 24th and 25th of June. And in spite of a three inch rain a day or two after the first planting and extremely dry weather after the second planting -we got a fine stand all the way through with only a little trouble with weeds and this on the earlier Planting". This planting was a little slow in getting through two inches of dirt which had washed in on top the half inch-the depth we covered it. Both plantings were well matured and standing well, save in a few spots, when we started combining; on Sept. 21 but it had a high moisture content (about 20%). However, we had sold it for seed and it was to be artificially dried so we could go ahead and harvest without waiting for it to dry out naturally in the field as we did in the season just past. The field made: 45 bu. per acre based on 12 per cent moisture to which it was dried. Corn in the same field with identical tillage made 18 bu. of only fair quality whereas the Early Kalo was of excellent quality weighing over 60 pounds per measured bushel. . Atlas Gives Good Results . Our Atlas that year ('37) was oh plowed ground and planted with a loose ground lister seven pounds seed per acre and tended just as we cultivate corn. It made 10 or 12 tons of silage per acre without the grain which made 30 bu. We used a corn binder to har - vest this, hauling it to the silo and topping the grain with a vertical cutter-bar mounted on a combine and running the remainder of the bundle directly into the silo filler. I think that where one wants to separate the grain and run the fodder into the silo this is a very efficient method. The grain on this was fairly dry but not enough so to bin and since we were thinking in terms of seed we trucked it to a mill for drying. Part of the bundles laid in the window a few days and on this part we put the grain in several bins and the crib driveway and turned it several times arid in this way reduced the moisture to a point safe for putting in one bin. It we had had more bin room and had not been thinking of vitality I feel we would have handled it all this way but one must appreciate that moisture must be down to about 13% before it 1b safe to store It in quantity. After harvest we blank listed the Atlas field and left the Early Kalo stalks stand for winter pasture after freezing dry. The stock seemed to feed more in the Kalo than in the corn but this may have been due to the fact that the Kalo had ripened more normally with but little damage from dry weather whereas the corn had been hurt pretty. badly. : </seg>
         <seg id="p152">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Both of these fields were easy to till the following year and a variety of crops did well. The only experience we have had where crops did not do well following was in the case of Sudan grass matur - ed and cut for hay. Additional Varieties in 1038 This past season with a little better moisture conditions we decided to plant some of the dual purpose and taller growing grain sorghums which might be expected to yield better under reasonably favorable conditions than Early Kalo. We chose Western Black - hull kafir, Pink kafir, Club kafir, Kalo, Sooner Milo and also another sweet stalk variety—Leoti Red. These all did very well running from 4 3 bu. per acre for Kalo (which was under a great handicap being on alfalfa ground—the balance of this field made only 10 bu. of corn per acre) to Club kafir which made 64 bu. on rather thin ground. Results on all varieties follows: Atlas, 18 tons silage in - cluding 4 3 bu. grain, Leoti Red 14 tons silage including 43 bu. grain; Pink kafir 55 bu. grain and probably about 7 tons silage; Western Blackhull kafir 62 bu. grain, 7 tons silage; Club kafir 74 bu., Kalo 43 bu., Early Kalo 56, and Sooner Milo 60 bu. Had the standard Kalo not been on alfalfa ground these six primarily grain sorghums would have run pretty close together. With better moisture con - ditions the taller growing sorts, led by club, would have, in all likelihood, done relatively better than the dwarfer sorts but when extremely dry Early Kalo and Sooner would probably lead. These varieties were all either listed or loose ground listed and tended just as one cultivates corn. Harvesting was done in a variety of ways but mostly pretty much as I have described before. This year we solved the storage problem by bagging in two bushel burlap bags about two thousand bushels and leaving the balance stand in the shock or on the stalk until dry enough to bin. I want to mention that this year I planted a twelve acre field on July 18 to Sooner Milo. This came on fast and was mature when the first killing frost hit about the 10th of October. It had a high moisture content, of course, but dried out hard standing in the field. Several freezes were followed in about three weeks by a high wind which blew it almost completely down and we then turned steers (on grain feed) in and pastured it off successfully. These cattle were pretty well on feed —mostly grain sorghum—and did fine and cleaned up all grain. Our experience in the feeding of these grains is rather limited but we have fed some to all kinds of stock and all have relished them above any other grain. A bunch of lambs late this summer took on that thrifty bloom in less time with Early Kalo screenings than I ever before saw lambs do it. I regard it as good grain for every kind of stock. </seg>

Bruce Russell, VLce-President, Farmers National Company There are somewhere between 64-65,000 tenant operated farms in Nebraska, and of course, almost as many landlords. How many of these are interested in sorghums, I am unable to state, but I can truthfully say that as managing agents, or landlords by proxy, for more than 350 Nebraska farms, we are definitely interested in sor - ghums, particularly grain sorghums. Most of the 350 farms under our management are leased on the customary grain rental terms of x/ 3 to % the crops with a cash con - sideration for pasture, hayland and feed crops. In the past we and the tenants have depended largely upon two cash crops—wheat and corn—with the result that both of us have fared very badly indeed since 1934. We have had some good wheat crops, it is true, but our experience with corn has been most discouraging. Year after year, we have seen our corn start out with a "bang", grow beauti - fully thru the months of May and June, only to "blow-up" com - pletely after a few hot days in July or August. Here's the corn picture in Nebraska during July and August from 1934 to 1938 inclusive. The averagee State corn yield estimate for these years on July Ist was 180,000,000 bushels: July 1934—we lost 129,000,000 bushels Aug. 1935—We lost 56,000 bushels July 1936—We lost 152,000,000 bushels Aug. 1937—We lost 105,000,000 bushels Aug. 1938—We lost 82,000,000 bushels This is an average loss of 100,000,000 bushels annually during each of the past five years either in July or August. Is it any wonder in the face of these facts that we are interested in sorghums? What has the loss of corn crop meant to the landlord? It is obvious that he has had little or no corn rental and, as a result </seg>
         <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION of the loss of the corn crop tenants have been able to pay only a portion of the cash rental. The landlord has had to be content with the income from wheat and the little he could salvage from the sale of corn fodder and a compromise cash rental settlement On many farms this has been scarcely enough to pay taxes on the land and insurance on the buildings to say nothing of upkeep on build - ings and fences. Helping the Tenant And what about the tenant? In the past five years we have seen hundreds of tenants slip down from a more or less food finan - cial position to a point where after exhausting all sources of commercial credits, were forced to seek Government assistance. Many have be - come of necessity, more or less, wards of the government. Their downfall began in 1934 with the selling off of their greatest asset-livestock. Since that time they have gone from bad to worse until we find many today with ouly:a small part of their original herds and flocks. Some one has estimated that 80,000 of the 127 000 farms in Nebraska have no hogs at all. Many tenant farmers having become completely discouraged have quit farming or moved to other States in search of better con - ditions. As a result it .has become increasingly difficult for land - lords to find suitable tenants. Many good sets of Improvements are unoccupied because there are not enough farm families finan - cially able to farm all of the available land. Certainly, this is a •most unhealthy condition and something must be done about it for the good of the tenant, the landlord and Nebraska Agriculture. . Tenant and landlord alike are somewhat to blame for this un- Plesant situation. It seems to me that they and all the rest of us have built our Nebraska Agriculture, particularly in the area South of the Platte on a rather shaky foundation. It seems to me we have put too much faith in King Corn. As I look back over the experiences of the past five years, I cannot help but feel that had we been growing more grain and forage sorghums, many of our present problems would never have arisen. The sorghums, I believe, have a permanent place in our Nebraska Agriculture and should not be thought of as emergency crops. We have been slow to accept them, which is only natural, as it is human nature to resist change. We have run true to form by putting up a stiff resistance. It is interesting, and to some extent amusing, to look back and read what some of us have said during these drouth years. I was looking thru the 1933 annual report of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the other day and ran across this statement:—"Nebraska, of course, will never become a sorghum State such as Texas, Okla - homa, and Kansas. We produce a good corn crop too often tor that." </seg>
         <seg id="p156">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Even as late as May 24th, this year, a well known citizen made this statement before the Nebraska Bankers Association: "Decidedly the turn is upon us. We have every indication of generous rainfall and abundant crops." It has taken four or five years of costly experience to show us the way from now on but I think most of us are properly chastized. Livestock and Sorghums The past five years have thoroughly convinced me that the only - safe procedure for the tenant living south of the Platte is to build his livestock program on grain and forage sorghums and for the landlord to see that at least one-half of the acreage normally de - voted to corn is planted to Grain Sorghums. By building his live - stock enterprises on a foundation of sorghums rather than corn the tenant will stabilize his livestock production so that he need no longer be an "in and outer". As a result of this stabilized livestock program he will have funds for farm operation, living expense and his cash rental, and that's where the landlord profits. The landlord by having one-half of the normal corn acreage in grain sorghums will be assured of enough income to pay taxes and other fixed overhead and this with the cash rental the tenant can pay will be a marked improvement over the rental income re - ceived the past five years. Such a program, as we who are managing a large number of farms well know, presents new leasing problems that can and will be worked out between tenant and landlord on an equitable basis. On the great majority of our farms we have complied with the AAA progra.ni since its inception. Just how our plan for increasing our grain sorghum acreage will fit in is giving us landlords some worry. If we plant one-half the allotted corn acreage to grain sor - ghums, we would be penalized under the present rules for not plant - ing 80% of this corn allotment. This would automatically call for penalties if the 1938 rules hold for 1939. We are hopeful that the County and State officials in charge of the AAA will see to it that this ruling is changed. It seems to us that grain sorghums should qualify for payments the same as corn. Comparative Yields of Coin &amp; Grain Sorghums Our experience with grain sorghums the past three years has been about as follows: When corn failed completely we could ex - pect 15-20 bushels per acre from grain sorghums. On farms where the corn made 5-7 bushels in 1937, Early Kalo and Sooner Milo in </seg>

Even if the landlord had to sell the grain at a discount of 25% under corn the per acre income in good yeS woulo" compare favorably with corn, with the added iLuJance fea v ' thrown in for good measure. . We are not gravely concerned with the problem of finding a market for the landlord's share of the crop. Already some of the 0?*? S'Tr bUyiDS and shl^ "«*» sorghums and more or them will find it necessary to do so as the acreage increases, and n is increasing. In 1937 Nebraska farmers planted 184,000 acres of grain sorghums, increasing to 438,000 acres in 1938. A further increase can be expected in 1939. lunner Much of the crop will find a ready market at home as farmers and feeders learn more of the excellent feeding value of this grain Such experiments here at the Agricultural College by Prof Loeffel this fall are doing much to convince farmers that grain sorghums are a valuable crop. Loeffel produced 435 lb. of pork per acre with a protein supplement. At ?7.00 per cwt. this represents a per acre income of 130.45. Certainly a crop that will make such a return as this m spite of adverse weather conditions has a perman - ent place in our farming program. The following taken from last week's issue of an lowa farm Paper rather amused .me: "The main chance for avoiding a heavy overproduction of hogs in 1939 comes thru the drouth that wrecked the.corn crop in Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota this fall. These states will have to wait another year before they have enough corn to send them back into hog production full tilt." Evidently the editor hadn't heard of grain sorghums or Prof. Loeffel's experiment Is the landlord Interested in sorghums? lam sure that a great many of them are and that many more will be as they learn more about these dependable crops. Sorghums will tend to stabilize the livestock industry in Nebraska and should be of vital Interest to Nebraska landlords for livestock is, after all, the "backbone" of agriculture. A stabilized livestock program has a direct influence on land and, values, soil, fertility, proper land use, desirability of tenants and rental income, all of which are of paramount importance to the landlord. </seg>
         <seg id="p158">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A CASH MARKET FOR GRAIN SORGHUMS Fred E. Slefer Xebr. Grain Improvement Association Feed Grain Cash Market Unpopular At the present time, in dollars and cents it takes 18 bushels of corn to equal the price of 100 pounds ot live weight pork. This is the highest hog-corn ratio on record for the month of November. Consequently, this isn't a very popular time to be talking about a cash market for any feed grain. I might add further that only those who are marketing this year's feed grains through livestock will show a worthwhile profit, and, of course, ordinarily the livestock method is the most profitable method of marketing feed grains. With such a favorable feeding ratio I don't think we need to urge farmers to get back to livestock. They will get there, and as in past history they will overdo it and the largest numbers of live - stock will be sold at the lowest price. Xeed For Cash Market Regardless of what happens to the feed ratio, it is to a farmer's advantage to have both the opportunity of either marketing feed grains through livestock or on a cash market. Grain Sorghum Marketing Not New Grain sorghums have been handled for many years on some of our markets. The Kansas City Board of Trade's annual report records grain sorghums since 1911, and no doubt they handled them before then. The Omaha Exchange hasn't handled any to speak of, principally because local grain dealers in Nebraska haven't found them in sufficient quantities to concentrate carloads. Mr. Man - chester, secretary of the Omaha Grain Exchange, tells me they are equipped and authorized to handle sorghums. With a continued in - crease in acreage, Omaha will no doubt be able to get grain sorghums. How Grain Sorghums Are Graded Perhaps you would like to know how grain sorghums are graded on the market. First they are divided into classes according to their color. Class I, white; Class 11, yellow; Class 111, red; and Class TV, brown. Then as other grains are graded each class is broken down into grade No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and Sample. </seg>
         <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Slight Increase in Acres Harvested Looking 1 at what has happened in the past, we see that in the United States there hasn't been much of an increase in grain sorghum acres since 1919. The trend, as you see, is slightly upward. It is difficult to get accurate data on grain sorghums because sometimes both grain and forage sorghums are thrown together. However, I have tried to separate grain sorghums from forage sorghums. Grain sorghum acres harvested have remained around the 4 million mark.

By taking one day a week, prices from August 15 to December 1, 1938, No. 2 Kafir averaged 79 cents per cwt; No. 2 milo 81 cents per cwt., and corn 86 cents per cwt.

Commercial Companies Using Fewer Sorghums The B. C. Christopher Company of Kansas City has merchan - dized a lot of grain sorghums and they inform me that the sorghum business since 1932 has been very small. They tell me that since then the pa-ice of sorghums comparatively has been higher than the price of corn, and most feed manufacturers have dicontinued using them in their feed formulas. Naturally, the only way to get the feed manufacturers to include sorghums in their formulas is to de - liver sorghums at a lower price than corn. Here it is necessary ;to consider that these eastern manufacturers buy corn east of. here, while freight on grain sorghums from Kansas City to extreme eastern points is 40 to 45 cents per hundred. Another thing, it is expen - sive to change a feed formula, and unless commercial men are as - sured of a continuous supply, they aren't going- back to grain sor - ghums. The consuming trade expects to buy grain sorghums a little under the price of corn. However, in .many cases they are willing to pay the same price because there is less processing cost with sorghums than with corn. The G. L. F., a cooperative purchasing organization operating in the Northeast and doing more than 25 million dollars' worth of business a year, informs me that they have not used grain sorghums for the past 12 years and they don't anticipate future use of it un - less there is a continuous supply at prices under the price of corn. A study of carload receipts and shipments of the various states shows the following to be the largest processors of grain sorghums: Texas, Kansas, Missouri, California, Tennessee, Illinois, and New York. </seg>

Alabama ' 0 Some Grain Sorghums Exported I have been talking about the primary use of grain sorghums which is same sort of feed right here in the United States, most of H being used for poultry feeds. The second use is for export trade. Prior to 1930 we exported about 5% of the grain sorghums that came to terminal markets. Since then we haven't even exported one per cent of those being inspected. During the first 9 months of this year we exported about 600,000 bushels. This is already more than the total amount exported during the years 1933 to 1937. A considerable more will be exported before December 30, because the corn-sorghum price ratio is more favorable for exporters to move sorghums down to the gulf ports instead of corn. You may be interested to know which countries buy grain sor - ghums from;us. From 1928 to 1932 Germany bought an average of 2 million bushels per year, while the Netherlands bought nearly 1 million bushels per year. Other important buyers were Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Belgium, and Cuba. Since 1932 Germany hasn't purchased any of our grain sorghums. During the first nine </seg>
         <seg id="p164">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE months of 19 38 Belgium, France, and the Netherlands bought most of the 600,000 bushels exported. Suitable For Power Alcohol Another use of grain sorghums is for power alcohol uses. IE power alcohol proves practical, grain sorghums will have some use there. I understand chemists like grain sorghums better than most grains for alcohol production. The Atchison, Kansas plant con - tracted for 1,000 acres of Kafir and Milo last year at 85 cents per cwt. Summary Now to summarize briefly this grain sorghum business. First, a farmer should look at any crop from the standpoint of the amount of money it will make him. If he is in an area where corn isn't a sure crop, as is the western two-thirds of Nebraska except under irrigation, it is more profitable to grow something rather than noth - ing. Grain sorghums will come nearer giving you something year after year than will corn. Second, what are you going to do with the grain sorghums after you raise them? You can feed them yourself or sell them to a neighbor who will feed them. If you are in a neighborhood where a grain dealer can buy up a sufficient quantity to make a load, I am sure you will find a grain dealer anxious to get the business. He can already sell them on the Kansas City market and •whenever Omaha can get sufficient grain sorghums, they will establish a regular g.rain sorghum market. 1 have pointed out thai in the past grain sorghum cash prices have been a little lower than corn, which naturally should be. I think in general a similar relationship will occur in the future. ADJUSTING PLANTERS FOR SORGHUM SEED L. W. Hurlbut, Agriculture College In many instances the maximum returns from sorghums has not been received from the effort expanded in seedbed preparation or the seed planted because the lister or planter operator has used seed plates that were not properly suited to the seed planted. This is most likeiy to be prevalent in areas into which a relatively new crop is introduced. It is very likely to occur in a region where a crop yielding relatively small seeds is used to replace or used in conjunc - tion with a crop yielding relatively large seeds. This is especially so when a machine used to plant the old crop is also used to plant the new crop. The recent general acceptance of grain sorghums and Jiafir^ in .Nebraska has introduced this very problem. </seg>
         <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION a^ he^ 8t ste PJn thesolu«on of this problem is to consider the TJ*T r/ P°Tt °f yield «P«*™»ts which show in general that kafirs and most other grain sorghums give their highest yield of grain and forage when the plants are spaced six to eight inches apart ln£, &lt; i 6d °r Plant6r rOWS- When fOTa^ sorghums are Planted in lister or planter rows the highest tonnage may be topected by placing the plants four to; six inches apart The agronomist has also informed us that ordinarily under normal weather conditions, about 50 per cent less stand of sorghum plants may be expected in the field than is indicated by laboratory germin - ation tests. This information indicates that it will be necessary to Plant from two to three seeds every six inches inorder to expect one plant approximately every six inches in the row. In most cases the low field germination is considered when a recommended plant - ing rate is given. How to Obtain the Proper Seed Plate Considering the general information at hand, two general methods may be used to obtain the proper seed plate for a given sorghum seed. The suggested methods are as follows: I—SEND SEED TO YOUR IMPLEMENT DEALER OR NEAREST BRANCH HOUSE FOR A SEED PLATE TEST. In general, if a representative quart sample of seed is sent to a dealer he will be able to determine the/correct seed plate to use. If the dealer is not equipped to do seedi plate testing, he will send the sample, or advise about sending the same, to the nearest branch house for a test. There generally is no charge or obligation for this service. When seed is sent in for testing the following information is desired: 1. Give the model number of the planter or lister with which the seed is to be planted. 2. State the row width. 3. If the seed is to be checked or dropped in hills/give the number of kernels desired per hill. 4. If the seed is to be drilled, give the drilling distance desired or the seeding rate desired in pounds per acre. 5. Indicate whether or not you wish the seed returned after the \ test.' .;¦¦,: ,-.•..-.-¦ ¦ ¦ -... -.'..-. 6. Request the proper sprocket arrangement to be used with the selected plate. LI—DRILL BLANK PLATES TO FIT THE SEED. </seg>
         <seg id="p166">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE: A close study of the lister or planter instruction book may help to eliminate a number of steps that are to be listed for completing this job. If the instruction book has been lost, a new one can gen - erally be secured from the manufacturer. The instruction book not only contains helpful hints on the operation of the planter or lister, but it also contains helpful tables that give the wheel travel per revolution of the seed plate, and the drilling distances that can be obtained with various sprocket and seed plate combinations. If this information is not available for the planter or lister, we suggest the following procedure to be used in determining the number of holes to drill in the seed plate to give the desired seed spacing. 1. Uiock the lister drive wheel off the floor. 2. Disconnect the clutch throw-out link so that the clutch will be engaged while the wheel is in the raised position. '!. Place a mark on the seed plate drive gear and a corresponding reference mark on the seed box floor plate or on the frame of the lister box. 4. Fix a reference point near the rim of the drive wheel. An oil can with a spout set near the drive wheel will make a good reference point. L. Mark the rim of the drive wheel at the reference point. 6. Turn the drive wheel enough to give one revolution of the seed plate. 7. Determine the inches of wheel circumference that passed the reference point while the seed plate made one revolution. 8. Determine the number of holes needed in the seed plate to give the desired seed spacing. Example: Assume that 192 inches of wheel circumference passed the reference point during one revolution of the seed plate and that the hill spacing desired is 6 inches. Then 192 inches divided by 6" inches equals 32. This means that 32 hills should be dropped during one revolution of the seed plate. Since there are generally several spro - cket or gear combinations on a lister, it is possible to obtain several different hill spacings with a plate having a given number of seed holes. Drilling Blank Plates When drilling a blank plate the holes should be accurately located by the use of dividers (a fence staple •will work very well in place of the dividers i and spotted in with a center punch.

Divide the number of seeds by the circumference of the drive wheel (in feet.) The result will be the approximate number of seeds that would be planted per linear foot. Note: When reasonably good quality seed is used, 4 to 6 seeds per linear foot is the proper rate of planting for grain sor - ghums. For forage sorghums, 6 to 8 seeds per linear foot is recommended. It is expected that under ordinary conditions less than one-half the seeds planted will produce mature plants. When extra high quality seed is used and when germination conditions are ideal, these rates of seeding should be reduced. An ideal stand for most grain sorghums is one plant every six to eight inches. For forage sorghums, a 4" to 6" spacing is de - sirable. In checking the rate of planting by the above method, it is well to make more than one determination. During the planting opera - tion it is well to check the plates occasionally to see that none of the drill holes are clogged and that the planter box is not permit - ting seed to escape around the plate. PALATABILITY OP SOKUHUMSI A. F. Swanson- Fort Hays Exp. Sta., Hays, Kansas Introduction Sorghums differ in palatability when fed as fodder or stover, even when grown with the same amount of .rainfall and on the same type of seedbed. Cattle have the ability to detect the fac - tors which make one sorghum more palatable than another with a considerable degree of accuracy, and do so in close agreement when two or more animals are allowed to choose from a number of var - ieties. These and other conclusions were drawn after three years of experimental work at the Hays station in the attempt to deter - mine what type of sorghum should be developed through plant breed - ing methods that would be acceptable to the farm animals. As the work progressed it soon became evident that cattle had definite i Presented at the annual meeting of Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and h ccdi-rs- Association. Lincoln, Nebraska.

It was'found that irain-^ fall and season and time of cutting influenced palatability as well as varietal differences. The Ranking of the Varieties as to Palatability At the end of three years of palatability tests, the paired an - imals ranked twelve of the best representative sorghums grown on the Plains into three distinct groups as to palatability, as shown in Table 1. The sorghums in these groups varied as to the amount of juiciness, sweetness and moisture in the stems. Early Sumac, Hegari, Atlas, Leoti Red and Black Amber ranked highest in palatability but there was little choice between the first four varieties. AH of the above varieties with the exception of Hegari belong to the forage group generally recommended as the best suited for bundle feed or silage. Hegari is classed as a grain sorghum. It is not known just wiy Hegari ranked so high in pala - tability. The variety is extensively grown and is highly regarded by many stockmen for bundle feed. Hegari, however, is often erratic in yield, particularly when grown for grain. Pink kafir and Western Blackhull representing the kafir group of the grain sorghums were intermediate in palatability as determin - ed by the cattle. These varieties belong to the grain sorghum group with stalks more or less juicy but not sweet. Under heavy grain production kafir stalks lose much of their palatability. Lowest in the scale of palatability were such sorghums as Chey - enne, Feterita and Wheatland. Such varieties have still less juici - ness, sweetness or moisture than the kafir group, particularly under </seg>

The Influence of Sugar on Palatability The preference shown by cattle for the fodder or stover of one variety of sorghum over another is closely associated with the amount of sugar present in the stems. It is known that sorghums can store sugars in the stems. We do not know just why this occurs in sor - ghums, ami seemingly to a much greater degree than in any of our more common forage crops. The ability of the sorghums to store sugars in the stems is one reason for their great value in livestock production, a fact which livestock men will more and more come to appreciate. It is now well known that the forage sorghums such as Early Sumac, Leoti Red and Atlas have the ability to store sugars in the stems to a much greater degree than most of the grain sor - ghums. In fact, a grain sorghum variety is never used in making molasses for the simple reason that the stems are relatively low in sugar content. On the other hand, the grain sorghums tend to trans - locate relatively larger amounts of the sugars from the stems to the heads to make grain in the form of starch. When this occurs the </seg>

Therefore the choice as to whether to grow a forage or a grain sorghum depends on how the livestock farmer wants to use the crop. Moisture as a Palatability Factor -',':;. Aslde from the amount of sugar in the stems, palatability is influenced considerably by the moisture content of the stems. A moisture content of from 40 to 50 percent in a forage sorghum gen - erally makes it highly palatable unless the stalks are very coarse As the moisture content in- the stalks drops, so does palatability, andjor this reason a fodder feed is as a rule much more acceptable in the early part of the winter than in early spring. The drop in moisture content is from 10 to 30 or more percent more rapid in the plants of a grain sorghum than for a forage sorghum, and usual - ly more than 10 percent greater. When the moisture content reaches 20 percent, palatability is markedly reduced, particularly for a grain sorghum. . It was also found that cutting a sorghum crop prematurely in September not only reduced the palatability but seemingly reduced the feeding value even though the heads had reached the milk stage. When harvested early the moisture content of the fodder may fall as low or lower than 20 percent. On the other hand drouth stricken Pink kafir and Early Sumac which had failed to head but which had otherwise made substantial growth and tonnage was as well relish - ed as the stalks from the same varieties cut in the hard dough stage. Size ot Stems a Palatability Factor The size and fineness of the stems is also a factor in palatability It was found that aside from sweetness and moisture in the stalks' stems about one-half inch in diameter were highly acceptable to </seg>
         <seg id="p174">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE the cattle, particularly in such varieties as were classed among the forage group. When the stalks are small the cattle usually grasp and break the slender stalks in the middle with their tongues, and consume the entire plant with little waste. Leaves not as Palatable as Hie Stems It was also noted that when feeding a good forage sorghum in the bundle the cattle showed a preference for the stems over the leaves. Chemical analysis showed that the amount of total car - bohydrates was from 5 to 10 percent higher in the stems than in the leaves among the forage sorghums. It was also noted that the total amount of carbohydrates was higher in the stems of forage sorghums than in the stems of grain sorghums. This information is of interest in that the amount of total carbohydrates is partly a measure of the amount of sugars in the stems. However, when the grain sorghums have produced from 12 to 15 bushels of grain to the acre, the total carbohydrates in the stems tended to be as low or slightly lower than for the leaves. It was observed during the palatability test that when the cattle were compelled to feed on the dry fodder of such grain sorghums as feterita, milo or Early Kalo, they would often take the leaves in preference to the stalks. The higher the grain yield of a grain sor - ghum, the less likely are the animals to consume the stalks. In another test in which the leaves from Atlas silage were sep - arated from the stem portion of the silage with an electric fan and then fed separately to the cattle, the cattle first consumed the stem silage completely before eating the leaf silage. On the other hand the cattle did not well relish the bundle feed of good forage sor - ghum where all of the leaves had been entirely stripped from the plants by hand. Some leaves on the stalks are desirable and seem - ingly necessary for best palatability. On the other hand it is some - what questionable whether a variety with an over-abundance of leaves in proportion to the amount of stem would prove as satis - factory for forage use as such varieties having the characteristics of Early Sumac, Atlas or Leoti Red. When cattle pick the leaves from the stems of any sorghum fodder or stover. It is usually a sign that the feed lacks much in palatability and generally is of low feeding value. Such dry feed may be considerably improved by ensiling; and if run through a hammer-mill less of the material will be wasted. Hammer-milling a dry feed adds noting to its feeding value, however.

         <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' .ASSOCIATION only is the moisture content restored in the feed, but when ensiled the fermentation processes aid in breaking down the crude fiber and whatever grain might be present into a simpler digestive form, mak - ing: such material not only more palatable but of greater nutritive value. This is illustrated by a comparative study made over the three,year period 1929-1931 at the Hays station when Pink kafir was fed in the form of whole fodder, chopped fodder, ground fodder and silage from the whole plant. The daily gains were respectively 1.26, 1.12, 1.34 and 1.59 pounds for the different forms of feed. There is also evidence that silage from a good forage sorghum may be expected to produce.better gains than when the silage is made from a grain sorghum. Such a study was made at the Hays station in 1934-1935 when pound for pound Pink kafir silage was compared i directly with Atlas silage. The Atlas silage produced 33 percent more daily gain. Again during the winter of 1925-1926 it was found that silage made from Early Sumac with the heads, removed (stover) produced approximately 33 percent more gain than silage from Pink kafir with the heads removed. Other Observations on Palatability &#132;„ " should be pointed out that any given variety of sorghum may differ considerably from year to year in palatability and in feeding value. Much depends on the amount and time of rainfall during the growing season, dates of planting and harvesting, and the amount of atmospheric moisture during the fall when the crop is going through the curing processes. Cattle are remarkably sensitive to feeds and one of the most interesting features of the palatability work at Hays was the close agreement as to the likes and dislikes between pairs of animals under observation. It was noted that when the cattle showed a strong preference for a palatable variety, they consumed nearly one-third more bundle feed and always carried a good fill, than when fed an unpalatable fodder, a fact which has frequently been observed by ranchers. While the experimental work was not planned to deter - mine accurate daily gains, yet it was observed for one 28-day period that when the cattle were fed palatable sorghum fodder a satisfac-j tory increase in weight was made, and when the fodder was dr/ ; uJ palatable and pithy there was little or no increase in weight. ' Introduced to Mr. Sam T. Schrock i A. H. Maunder, Phelps Co. Agr. Agent It is not my purpose to speak to you upon the subject of sor - . ghums but rather to introduce to you a man who has been growing sorghums for nearly thirty years on his farm in Phelps county.' </seg>
         <seg id="p176">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mr. Sam T. Schrock of Holdrege is one of the largest and most successful farmers of Phelps county. He operates a 2,700 acre farm or ranch about 14 miles north east of Holdrege in the edge of the sand hills. I believe that much of his success can be attribu - ted to the fact that he always assures himself of a bountiful supply of feed for his livestock through the, growing of sorghums and other feed crops. I happen to know that in 1934 when most farmers were out of feed, Mr. Schrock had several thousand bushels of corn in storage from previous years as well as several hundred tons of roughage. He had plenty of feed for his own livestock as well as a surplus to sell to his neighbors. On account of his large acreage of forage crops Mr. Sam Schrock's farming operations fit very well into the agricultural con - servation program and it is no hardship at all for him to comply. In 1938 he had 160 acres of his crop land in sorghums. Mr. Schrock is also interested in other conservation meaaures. He has planted and maintained a large acreage of trees on his farm. Just this summer he purchased a tract of 160 acres of lagoon bordering the city of Holdrege on the south. He has dredged out a large drainage ditch through the heart of the lagoon, is building a road and plans to transform it from an eyesore to a beauty spot by planting of trees. Many people laugh at some of Mr. Schrock's ven - tures but he usually comes out ahead financially. He also has large business interests in Holdrege but it was a case of a farmer coming to town .rather than a business man becom - ing a farmer. He is a member of the Hastings Production Credit Association and was elected president of that organization at their last annual meeting. He is a strong booster for that organization and it has made a healthy growth since he has been president. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present Mr. Sam T. Schrock who will give you his experiences in growing and feeding of sorghums on his farm. SORGHUMS ON A PHELPS COUNTY FARM Sam T. Schrock, Holdrege, Nebraska I came to Phelps County in 1890 and that was just two years after the big blizzard of 1888. My mother was a widow and there were three of us boys. I was the oldest. We moved on an 80 acre farm just 6 miles north of Holdrege. We lived in a dugout for 10 years. We had no school in winter at that time, just two months in the fall and two months in the spring as the directors and parents were afraid to send the children across the prairies after the cold winter of 1888. Our school house -was </seg>
         <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 175 made of sod and stood 7 miles north of Holdrege on Lincoln street road.- We had a large table in the center of the building and we would bring our chairs from home and sit around the table as they do nowadays for a round table discussion. I have always felt bad that I could not have a good education. I might have been a lawyer doctor, preacher, auctioner, or traveling man but I am only an old dirt farmer. I have been growing sorghums since 1910 but at that time I raised only some milo maize and feterita and white kafir. At that time we called it Black hull. In the last ten years we have been making speciality of the sorghum varieties. I very much prefer the Pink kafir, Leoti red, Sumac, and the Atlas sorgo. As they are all sweet stalk varieties with a good hammer grinder my fat cattle eat every bit and prefer this feed to the good alfalfa hay. I am sometimes asked how sorghums compare with ccrn in the amount of feed produced; I like my kind of sorghums real well but the good old yellow corn is hard to beat. I won't go back on yellow corn. I tell my neighbors that I can put more fat on cattle with my kind of sorghum kafirs than I can with white corn. I think the grain from the grain varieties is about as good as yellow corn but the stalk is of no value. I Cultural Practices Followed We always plant our kafirs with a lister in rows after we have Planted our corn. This is generally from June 5 to June 20 and sometimes later during the (last years. These dry years I have been doing some blank listing in the late fall and early spring. We always list our ground east and west and in that way every ittle bit of snow that might fall in the winter will lay in the furrow and when the sun comes it will hit the furrow all day and some - times the snow melts in a single day. If it snows again the next night it will be ready for more moisture. I am always careful when I plant so that the seed is not deeper than two inches and I set the lister so it will make a little ridge in the center of the row. I never plant-right down in a hog trough; By planting this way it will never get covered up when we have those heavy rains. We try to cut our kafir just a little before frost and Bometimes just after a frost as we like to let it gTow as long as it will. Last year we headed about 600 bushels of the grain sorghums. We cut off the heads and threw them in a wagon as you would shuck corn. This year we cut 150 acres and shocked it in nice big shocks and believe me it looks nice and the feed is nice. </seg>
         <seg id="p178">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Feeding the Sorghum Crop We grind the most of our sorghum varieties for the fat cattle but for the stock cattle we just take out a load in a clean place in the middle of the pasture or on the warm side of a hill. I have found that when you feed stock cattle the grain varieties they will eat off the heads in a hurry and follow you home but when you take out a load of the sweet sorghums they will stay right there until it is all gone and then lay down and rest. When they get up they will graze over the pasture until you come out again with a load. The cattle that I raise are a good grade of Herefords. I always keep purebred bulls. This year we have 42 white face calves but I generally start to buy some extra calves about February first. I buy from our neighbors and at the Kearney, Grand Island, and Holdrege sale barns and by May first we usually have plenty. Then we vaccinate, castrate, and dehorn every one and they all look like brothers as they are all red and white faces. In the early fall we sell the best ones off the grass and the poor grades I always feed. I have fed cattle all my life and have never spent $5.00 for any kind of cottoncake, cottonseed meal or molasses. My cattle must get along with what I can raise on my place such as Indian corn, Kafir corn, Prairie hay, and Alfalfa hay and when I sell them the money all belongs to Sa.m T. Schrock. I find that my cattle make very good gains on sorghums and a small quantity of alfalfa hay. I generally start to feed my cattle about November Ist by put - ting them on a new pasture and giving them a good load of kafir corn every day and in 10 days I start them in the corn field. At home in the yards they will have access to ground kafir and will gradually strengthen their feed. I never try to get them on the market by Christmas and again I don't like the March first market as that is the time the Tenters want to move and they sell out and again April first some people like to get away from taxes. I always try to be ready about May first and a little later and then I am not in competition with grass fat cattle. My cheap cattle when fat sell real well. We have taken trips to the east, west, and south and I have some fine uncles and cousins in eastern lowa and around Peoria, 111. where I was born 60 years ago. They ask me, "Why don't you come back to Peoria, 111., where we raise corn making 60 to 90 bushels to the acre?" I tell them, "Yes, but you have to have about three men to tend 90 to 100 acres of corn and two of us with two rubber tired tractors with dual wheels ten 600 acres." I tell them that Phelps county is the finest place in the world to farm and .make money. </seg>

College It is an unusual season of the year to be discussing the sub - ject of filling silos. However, many things in the farming and live - stock business the past several years have been unusual. Ranking well up in the list of new and complex problems is that of livestock factor 8' brought of course, has been the principal causative One of the most common of the inquiries coming to the college this fall and winter is worded something like this: "How do sorgo and corn fodder compare in feeding value with sorgo and corn sil - age?" Another question, "If fodder is less valuable than silage would it be practical or possible to fill a silo with it at this season of the year?" . Assuming that the fodder, sorghum or corn, has already been cut and shocked, the question naturally arises, why think of putting It into the silo at all? Why not feed it as fodder as intended in the first place? To me this problem is more important than the job itself of making cured fodder into silage. To justify the prac - tice permit me first to quote a few results from our feeding experi - ments comparing the two types of feed. Comparison of Fodder with SUage In 1929 a series of tests were started comparing ground corn fodder with corn silage. These tests continued for approximately five yeaTs. Each year the tests, were expanded to include more feeds and different crops. Per acre comparisons were made between fodder and silage from both the corn and sorghum crops. In each of these trials the total gains, economy of gains, and gains per acre of crop favored the feeding of silage over fodder. - Averaging three trials, com silage supplemented with either cottonseed cake or alfalfa produced .2 pound per head greater daily gain on steer calves than ground corn fodder. It produced fatter calves that finished quicker than ground fodder. An acre of corn fed as silage produced 96 pounds or 15 per cent more gain and fed a, steer: 40 days or 14 per cent longer. I </seg>
         <seg id="p180">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE When Atlas sorgo silage was compared with ground Atlas sorgo fodder there were greater differences than with the corn plant. Atlas silage produced .41 pound greater daily gain and noticeably fatter calves. The gain per acre upon sorgo silage was 290 pounds or 4 0 per cent greater than upon Atlas fodder. The relatively poor showing of Atlas fodder as compared to Atlas silage was due not only to a probable lower nutritive value of the stalk in the fodder, but more important to the poor use of the grain. The seed of the sorghum plant is small and hard and observa - tion shows that the bulk of it goes through the cattle undigested. Horses, on the other hand, do very well upon Atlas fodder. In grinding the sorghum fodders it is, of course, impractical to grind fine enough to crack the grain. Numerous tests have shown that it is impractical to feed whole sorghum grain to cattle. In the silo the grain, though not cracked, is moistened and so softened that the cattle get most of the good from it. Putting Atlas sorgo in a trench silo. Note the use of teams for packing. une acre of such silage fed with a protein supplement can be expected to produce from 1,000 to 2.000 lbs. of beef, depending upon yields. In addition to differences in feeding- value silage has other ad - vantages over fodder. With the trench silo in use there is less labor involved than in handling fodder. Investment in a silo and machinery is not a serious factor as in the past. Silage is a more succulent feed, more palatable to cattle, is easier handled, and above all does not have a keeping and storage problem. It does not de - teriorate with age or spoil and is not subject to weathering or loss from fire. Perhaps one of the greatest advantages of silage over fodder is that it can be used in more ways to advantage. It works into </seg>
         <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION varied rations better than fodder and is easier to. feed. Most anyone can feed silage without danger of injury to the animal. Put Fodder in Silo if Possible Most of the above facts are well known to Nebraska farmers and a good share of them filled their silos last fall. Some were for - tunate in having more roughage than their silo would hold and, therefore, shocked considerable sorghum or corn to be used as fod - der. Where ground fodder does not work .into the feeding program to very good advantage the silage should beted first and when the Biiojß emptied or sufficiently so, to .hold the remaining fodder it doubtless should go into the silo. _ Making silage firom dry fodder is not as difficult as is ordinary - ily supposed. The first essential is the addition of sufficient water, me amount of water necessary to insure silage production with or - dinary dry fodder is an amount equal to the amount of fodder by weight. Thus if one is ensiling 50 tons of fodder he would need to add at least 50 tons of water. Sixty tons of water would not do any damage but might even be better. It is difficult to add too much. For the ordinary silage^cutter two streams of water equal to that coming from a garden hose will usually be sufficient, though this should be considered as a minimum. Most blowers will not handle enough: water to make good; silage so it is desirable to run one stream into the down spout if possible. In placing the hose in the down spout it should be done so as to spread the water, or else Place a flat object over the end of the hose to cause the stream to spread. This gives a : much more uniform moisture content to the fodder. v I T! O, yeBrsasoa silp at the University was filled in March with shock Atlas sorgo fodder. One stream of water through a garden hose was run into the putter. At night a lawn sprinkler was placed in the silo and the water allowed to run all night. The .resulting silage was of excellent quality, good enough in fact that it was used as the roughage part-of the show steer rations. The silo as it is being filled should be thoroughly packed It is probably more important to get a good job of packing done with fodder silage than at the regular silo filling time with the green material. The time required for it to go through the fermenting process will be slightly longer than with silage made in the fall but usually two weeks are sufficient. Considering all factors involved it would appear tnat wherever possible shocked fodder should be made into silage. It is my opin- </seg>
         <seg id="p182">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE ion that the average feeder would be very well satisfied with the results. The advantages of such a practice far outweigh the dis - advantages upon many farms. The Use of Sorghum (iiain as a Feed for Livestock Prof. C. P. Thompson, Oklahoma A. &amp; M. College, Stillwater, Okla. The value of grain sorghums as compared to other cereals, es - pecially corn, has been definitely established by several of the ex - periment stations, especially those of Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Grain sorghums are very much like corn in composition. They are also deficient in vitamins A and D and are low in protein. The protein is of a rather inferior quality and they are also low in min - erals, especially calcium and phosphorus. Where grain sorghums are being fed extensively these deficiencies must be corrected. Green pasture will help to supplement the needed protein and minerals and will also supply vitamin A. Green colored legume hays that have been sun cured will supply the same nutrients found in green feeds and in addition are a good source of vitamin D. Grain Sorghums for Dairy Cattle The result of the various experiments have been so uniform that it is safe to make the statement that threshed, ground grain sor - ghums when fed to dairy cattle are almost if not wholly equal to corn in feeding value. In some cases grain sorghums have been found to be three per cent less valuable than corn but in most cases no difference was found. It has also been definitely proved that grain sorghums fed whole have a much lower feeding value than when ground. As a matter of fact it has been ascertained by same of the stations that as much as 50 per cent of the grains pass through the animals without being crushed. </seg>

Some of the stations reporting on the feeding of whole threshed grain sorghums for fattening beef cattle report that as much as 40 per cent passes through the animal unmasticated. Grinding grain sorghum heads for beef cattle also increases the value some 50. to 60 per cent over feeding the head whole. For beef cattle grinding threshed grain sorghums seems to have a slightly lower value as compared to corn than it does with dairy cattle. Generally speaking ground threshed grain sorghums for fattening beef cattle are rated as about eight per cent less in value per pound than good corn. Grain Sorghums for Sheep A great deal of experimental work has been done with sheep in which the various grain sorghums have been compared with corn as the principal concentrate. In practically every case it has been found that the grain sorghums either ground or whole are fully equal to corn for feeding sheep. In other words nothing is to be gained from grinding whole threshed grain sorghums when they are to be fed to sheep. * Grain Sorghums for Hogs j » There are various ways in which the grain sorghums can be fed to hogs, the principal ones that have been tested experimentally are as follows: </seg>
         <seg id="p184">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1. Grain sorghum heads. 2. Grain sorghum heads soaked. 3. Grain sorghum heads ground. ¦1. Threshed grain sorghums hand fed. 5. Threshed grain sorghums soaked. 6. Threshed grain sorghums self fed. 7. Ground gTain sorghums hand fed, dry. 8. Ground grain sorghums hand fed, moist. 9. Ground grain sorghums soaked and hand fed. 10. Ground grain sorghums self fed. Summarizing the various tests it was found that for hogs grain sorghums fed on the head will give fairly satisfactory results but unless they can be fed on cement floors there is bound to be con - siderable waste. In three trials at the Oklahoma Station it was found that it required approximately 25 per cent less grain when threshed to produce 100 pounds of gain than when fed on the head. It was also found that soaking grain sorghum heads decreased the palatability and caused a loss in feeding value. Grinding of grain sorghum heads for hogs proved detrimental as the ground heads contain so much crude fiber that the gains on the hogs were greatly reduced when they were forced to eat this fiber to get the grain that was mixed with it. Grinding threshed grain sorghums increased their feeding value about eight per cent if fed by hand but only about three per cent over whole grain sorghums when fed from a self-feeder. At the Texas Station they found that where whole grain sor - ghums were hand fed that about 10 per cent of the grain passed through the hog unmasticated but when self fed only 2 per cent was unmasticated. It is pretty safe to conclude from these results that the best way to utilize grain sorghums for fattening hogs is to mix them with the proper protein supplements and place them in a self - feeder. HOGGING OFF SORGHUMS Wm. J. Loeffel, Agr. College One of the chief objections to sorghum production is the prob - lem of harvesting. It was thought that if we could eliminate this problem that it would increase interest in sorghum production. In early June 1938 we planted three acres each of Minnesota No. 13 corn, Day milo, Sooner milo, and Early kalo. A uniform stand was secured and clean cutivation maintained throughout the summer. Drought and grasshoppers resulted in heavy losses to the corn, the final yield being 7% bushels per acre. As a (result of rainfall in late August the sorghums continued to grow and the </seg>
         <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION - finaI yield were computed at 31 bushels for the Day 38 bushels for the Sooner, and 36% bushels for the Early kalo. The three y£fetea iLZIZ fenCed and™»*enced, making six lots of a^ Z *Zl* aMeS ea°h- A P^able fence was constructed in eTch lot which gave the pigs access to approximately one-half acre into °^7tT7\ n } B PlgS averagln* 94 Pounds were turned into each of the lots.

Lot 4 which had no supplement, gained 1.04 pounds per head daily but all TtlTlT SIT WhlCb FeCelVed g °Od SU?Plements from 1.41 to 1.66 pounds per head daily. Results of Hogging Off Experiments When the pigs were removed from the lot on October 9, some considerable quantities of grain sorghum still remained in the lots. I his grain was salvaged to some extent by the use of thin pigs and ' possibly more effective work would have been done by the use of chickens or turkeys. All of the grain produced in the lot was charged to the. pigs, whether it was consumed or not. In Lot*4 where no supplement was fed, 594 pounds of milo or 10.6 bushels were required to produce 100 pounds of gain. Where a good sup - plement was fed the amount of grain required to produce 100 pounds of gain ranged from 7.21 bushels to 9.35. Where a good protein supplement was fed the gain produced per acre averaged 435 pounds. After deducting the cost of the supplement the pigs returned 83 cents per bushel for the grain sorghum with hogs at ?8 per hun - dred and 71 cents per bushel if the live hogs were valued at ?7 per hundred. If we figure the, hogs worth only $6 per hundred the value of the grain sorghum is 59 cents and with ?5-hogs the pigs returned 47 cents. In other words,- the price returned for the grain sorghum per bushel was approximately U per cent of the price of hogs per hundred pounds. In arriving at these values we figured tankage at $50 a ton, cottonseed meal at ?30 and milk at 25 cents per hundred. The feeding of a good protein supplement seems desirable in order to efficiently use grain sorghums by hogging them down. In Lot 4 where no supplement was fed the pigs devoured all of the </seg>

The foliage of the Sooner variety seemed to be the most palatable, with that of the Early kalo ranking second and that of the Day practically untouched. The pigs broke down the Early kalo very soon after they were turned into the lot. The same thing hap - pened, altho not to so marked a degree, with the Sooner variety. Comparatively little breaking down occurred with the Day variety. Whether this variety possessed a stronger stalk or whether the heads were so low that it was not necessary to break it down is not clear. As 1 See It R. E. Holland, Agr. College I recall several years ago at the International Live Stock Show seeing an exhibit of three beef animals representing progress made in livestock types or the type of feeders in the past 50 years. There was an old four or five year old beef steer, then the inter - mediate type, and the streamlined baby beef of the present day. They represented in a very perfect way the progress which has been made in that particular line. We seldom recognize history in the making and history con - tains no "ifs". We don't know what our state would have been had it not been for the introduction of winter wheat, Kherson oats, al - falfa, or many of these types and strains of grain. You see there is no "if" there. In history we have only what is recorded. Mr. Gross expressed it very well this morning in his statement, and showed the milestones that mark our progress in agriculture in this state. The introduction of winter wheat in the early nineties, and how it increased in acreage and what it meant to the state — one million acres in 1900, some three million in 1913; then alfalfa,— some of you may recall almost the first introduction of alfalfa Into the state in 1895. Even in 1905 there were only three hundred thou - sand acres, but in the next ten years that had multiplied by four, or over one million acres. ' Kherson oats was introduced into the United States by one of our own staff and has been the basis for the improvement in oats during these years. The old Kherson we don't grow very much any more but we have the improved strains. And sweet clover. I can recall about 25 years ago when I was a student, one of the speakers at Organized Agriculture was a Mr. Murphy from Madison County who spoke on the subject of sweet clover. He brought a sack of sweet clover that the people might know and see what it was. Colorado, years ago, almost passed a law making it a misdemeanor to grow sweet clover on the farm. </seg>

We are going to learn to determine what our problems are then how to solve them; to build upon our farms livestock and feed balances; to work out a proper farm organization. We can do this through our land use studies, which are all inclusive Land use sounds rather restrictive but It covers the whole field of proper land use, in order to secure a proper income on the farm. You have had several problems discussed today which I feel we are going to look to more and more in the future. One which s growing-which we can not take lightly is what we might call the tenant-landlord relationship: It is not a tenant problem alone and not a landlord problem alone. It faces the lank owner as well as the tenant. It is also a vital community problem. </seg>
         <seg id="p188">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Then so far as our sorghum crops are concerned there is that problem of finding a cash market which was discussed this morn - ing. There again is one problem the solution of which will insure the future of improving sorghums as a grain crop. I believe the progress and welfare of a state like ours is the acceptance of approved and improved practices, new and improved strains, and varieties of crops and livestock, better tillage practices, better feeding practices, control of livestock and crop diseases and pests. What is our job here in the college? As we see it, our job is two-fold. One is research,—finding out through a period of years under various conditions what practices are sound. The other job is one of extending information that is gained from our research work and information that is acquired from practices in the field, to others. Determining what our real problems are, and bringing to bear upon those problems the combined experience of research and field practice—weaving that all into a program that will help to make possible a better living for farm families in Nebraska—that, as we see it, is what our job is. Annual Business Meeting The annual meeting of the Association was held on December 7, 1938 and was called to order by H. L. Wahlgren, president. The minutes of the January 1938 meeting were read by the Secretary and approved. The report of the Treasurer, Mr. Gross, was read and approved. Mr. Lloyd Nickolls reported on the auditing committee which had checked the Treasurer's books and found them to be correct as read by the Treasurer. The committee was composed of Mr. Nickolls, E. R. Pinney, and B. F. Frolik. The auditing committee's report was accepted. Dr. A. L. Frolik gave a report on the college judging team ac - tivities and introduced the members of the judging team, Rundall Peterson from Grant, Harold Schudel from North Loup, and David McGill of Waverly. These boys placed second at Kansas City among seven other teams and were fortunate to win the Chicago contest in competition with 11 other teams. David McGill was high man of the entire contest, setting the third highest record ever made. These boys are working all or part of their way through school. Two </seg>

The team rep - resenting Nebraska must first win the judging contest held on the campus the Saturday preceding the opening of the State Pair This year the team from Perkins county won first but at the contest were declared ineligible because one of the members had made the trip to Chicago previously representing another contest, so the second Place team from Custer county made the trip. The members were Ted Farmer, Charley McCaslln, and Russell Adams. One interesting sidelight on the team was that Mr. Adams, the leader of the club from Custer county, saw not only his son go to Chicago as a crops judging team member, but his daughter who went representing the girl's clothing team from Nebraska. At Chicago, Mr. Gross and Mr. Frollk were able to make first-hand observations of the manner in which the judging contest was conducted and we hope to be able to capitalize on it next year in coaching Nebraska's! team." Mr. Wahlgren called on Mr. Gross to report ion a resolution He reported as follows: "Two years ago the Association passed a resolution asking our congressman to determine the feasability of installing a sodium chlorate manufacturing plant in connection with one of our hydro - electric projects. It was pointed out that most of the bindweed in - festlon is in Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota, and that a plant in Nebraska would thus provide chlorate near at hand and thus reduce freight charges. At the present time, all the chlorate used is either imported from foreign countries or comes from plants on the east coast. It seems there was little action taken by our con - gressman as the result of this resolution. Mr. Thompson has sug - gested that we resuhmit this resolution to our congressmen with the hope that some definite action will be taken." It was moved by Mr Keim that this be referred to the board of directors. The motion was seconded and carried. Mr. McArdle raised the questions as to why pressure could not be brought to bear to bring a government regional laboratory to Nebraska. The Tripple A has appropriated $4,000,000 for these lab - oratories. It would be a wonderful thing to bring one of them here. </seg>
         <seg id="p190">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE The prestige of the Association would help in this regard. It would seem that a resolution would be in order to this effect. At the suggestion of Mr. Gross, M.r. McArdle made a motion that the Board of Directors should take action toward bringing the experimental laboratory to Nebraska The motion was seconded and carried. Mr. Wahlgren called for an expression from the crop growers present as to allowing funds for various activities, $300.00 toward the pasture-forage-livestock program, $100.00 toward the college judg - ing team, and $50.00 toward the 4-H crops judging team. Amos Gramlich moved that the Association allow $300.00 for the pasture improvement program, $100.00 for the college team, and $50.00 for the 4-H judging team. The motion was seconded by Mr. Eberspacher. Carried. The nominating committee, through Mr. Lloyd Nickolls, reported as follows: Nominated Mr. Charles Roggenbach of Wayne, Mr. George Domingo of Weeping Water, and Mr. Bert Mott of Hastings as directors; Mr. D. L. Gross as secretary-treasurer. The committee was composed of Mr. F. D. Keim, Art Osterman, and Mr. Nickolls. The committee report was accepted. Motion made and carried to elect those nominated. No other business appearing, the meeting adjourned. FINANCIAL STATEMENT NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION By D. L.

It is with great pleasure that I introduce to you now as our first </seg>

He said—"When 1 prays Dear Lord, send me a turkey, I don't very often get one, bu when I prays Dear Lord, send this niggah out to get a turkey I most always comes back with one." . .. Mr. Nisbet intimated that we might write Santa Olaus for the things listed above but recommended the other way-dairy cows. He then gave what he called a crude illustration of two cows that he knew back .home. The name of the one was Lulu Belle and the other was W. PA. (Wilma Pantlac Alcartra). Lulu Belle pro - duced 375 pounds of butter fat in a year, producing a net profit after feeding costs were decucted of ?35. W. P. A. produced 160 pounds of butterfat, with a net profit of $1.00. Then in making the com - parison of the two cows in their respective ability to purchase the articles wanted-it would be necessary to milk three Lulu Belles a year to buy the washing ma,chine at $89.50, or about 90 W. P A's to buy the same washing machine—four Lulu Belles to buy the manure spreader or 135 W...P. A.'s ($135.)-It would require 450 w. P. A.'s to buy the automobile (asking the crowd how many in the audience milked 450 cows a year). A very clear picture was made of the comparison of the milk yield of the poor producing cow with the one with producing ability. He further explained that feeding good feeds, properly balanced rations, would not bring up the milk yield of a cow having no inheritability to produce at the higher level. For example putting airplane gas into a manure spreader will never make it tly. Breeding is one of the first con- </seg>

Then on the subject of feed—Milk production depends upon feed, Reproduction depends upon feed, Longevity depends upon feed. He emphasized the necessity of a sound disease program stating that type, feed, and production are worthless when disease comes into the herd, such as Bang's disease, mastitis, trichomoniasis, etc. After summarizing his discussion and urging those present to take home and use the information they had received in the various meetings, he told the following story of a man who had imbibed too freely. On Mr. Nisbet's way back to his hotel one night he noticed the man under a street lamp evidently looking for something he had lost. When asked by Mr. Nisbet what he had lost, he answered that he had lost a 11.00 bill and couldn't find it. And when questioned further, said that he had lost it under a distant elm tree. "Then why, " asked Mr. Nisbet, "are you looking for it under this street lamp if you lost it over there?" He said, "Aren't you silly? Be - cause there isn't any light over there." HOW TO BL'ILD AND MAINTAIN A PROFITABLE DAIRY HERD J. C. Nisbet, Associate Editor Hoard's Dairyman, Ft. Atkinson, Wisconsin The building and maintaining of a profitable dairy herd is something more easily talked about than done. It takes a guiding hand backed up by a lot of intelligence, one well informed on the many sides to this picture, one who likes his job, likes to work, and is blessed with some small measure of good fortune. I'rofitable herd building is the blending together of several forces, chief among which may be listed a sound breeding program, a prac - tical and adequate feeding program, and a comprehensive program o£ management and disease control. BREKDING PROGRAM No amount of feed, management, or disease control can get out of a cow a production level that she has not inherited. The fundamental purpose of the dairy animal is to take crops that are grown on our farms and market them for us to a greater advantage than if we hauled them directly to the elevator. Cows are limited in what they can pay for feed by their inherent ability. The first feed must go into maintaining of the body, so here is a total loss for the work we have done on our fields and with our crops. A cow producing 125 pounds fat a year charges up a 36 cent </seg>
         <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION feed cost against every pound of butter fat she produces. If butter - fat sells for 30 cents we lose on this cow some $7.50 that we might have had selling our crops on the market. A cow producing 300 pounds fat charges up a feed cost of~2l cents per pound fat. This results in a profit over what the elevator v.ould have paid us of $27. A 500 pound fat cow charges but 17 cents feed cost against every pound of fat. She makes a return on her yearly production of ?65 above market price for feed. i ? w W^ th; erefore are faced with the need of a breeding program that will give us a herd of high producing cows. This means a rec - ord-keeping project: must be entered into, for the first step is to o.cate the cow carrying a low production inheritance and eliminate her from the herd. One year's record keeping doesn't get the job done; the cow must be continually checked on for lifetime records are the ones that tell the story of farm profit. Just for example, lets look a minute at a few simple facts. The first two years that a cow is on your farm after birth, she doesn't return a bit of profit bhe is, however, charging up a feed bill. It takes about two years of production to square up her feed bill to date. This means bossy is now foui year old. If she lives to be six, she still has two years and only two years to make her owner a lifetime profit. If she has been returning, say, $30 profit above feed cost each year, she will have a total of $60 lifetime profit. A cow producing no more than $30 profit a year, but living to ten years of age, has four years out to pay up all bills and then six years for returning a profit. At $30 per year this cow returns $180 or as much as thressix-year-olds would do, who produce no more in a single year. Thus, longevity of. production is a most important consideration. : •..-'.¦.' ." lowa records give some light on what a problem we have here Out of 100 two-year-old heifers coming into the herd, we can expect about 77 to be still in the herd as three-year-olds; 57 as four-year - olds; 41 as five-year-olds; 31 as six-year-olds; 22 as seven-year-olds - -14 as eight-year-olds, and 11 as nine-year-olds. Selection of breed - ing stock .can well Include a study of longevity. Record keeping projects that are continued do far more than locate the poor cows and build up lifetime records; they point out the brood cows and prove the sires. In a study of every profitable herd there is usually to be found one real cow whose influence on that herd is outstanding. A number of good producing, good type progeny trace to her. These are the cows we are beginning to look upon as brood cows. These are cows who not only have inherited the ability </seg>
         <seg id="p218">REPORT OF XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 216 to produce at a profitable level, but who in addition have that purity of inheritance that enables them to hand on to their offspring a valuable inherent makeup. The mating of these brood cows to outstanding proved sires is the program of the sucessful breeding of dairy cattle. FEEDING PROGRAM The feeding program for dairy cows must be such that will take care of the cows' needs and requirements. This means plenty of good roughage and a longer season of adequate pastures. It means attention to methods of haymaking and will store the goodness put into the roughage until the cow consumes it. It means pasture fer - tilization, rotation, and the growing of supplementary crops. Undoubtedly, the scientist of the future is going to show us how to feed our cows through greater knowledge of feeding the soil to grow a better, more mineralized, or what not sort of feed. DISEASE CONTROL The management and control of disease in our herds is just as important from the standpoint of building and maintaining a profit - earning unit as is breeding and feeding. Our ever-increasing the amount of milk we expect our cows to produce is making the battle against disease a more important one. The T. B. battle and Bang's Disease we have coming along pretty well. Mastitis comes in now as the next serious consideration. Following that will be Trichomoniasis and further trouble in the reproductive organs of our dairy animals. Right now we know the profitable and practical program is to have a cow milk about ten months of the year, be dry six to eight weeks, and freshen again at about the twelve month period. How many co-ws in our herds aTe close to 100 per cent from the breeding efficiency standpoint? How many services are wasted? How many are required for conception? The future holds some answers to this problem. We may be look - ing more closely to the time we breed a cow. Facts show the heat period lasts from about 11 to 2 2 hours. Ovulation occurs at least 2 4 hours after heat. The sperm lite is about 30 hours and the egg life is six hours. One can readily see how the time of breeding can be a very important factor. One other project coming into the picture offers possibilities for building and maintaining a profitable dairy herd. This is the program of artificial insemination. We should not go too fast or expect it to do everything for us. There is going to be needed a </seg>

MINERALS FOR ANIMALS—Facts versus Fiction Dr. C. F. Huffman .Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station, East Lansing It is a pleasure for me to visit Nebraska again. Professor Davis and his staff are doing a splendid job of serving the dairy interests of this great state. Minerals are needed to develop the skeleton and for the proper functioning of the glands and organs of the animal body. Nut - rition experiments show that of all the elements present in the body, only sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, iron, iodine, manganese, copper, zinc, and possibly cobalt are essential for a well balanced ration. The necessity of mineral supplements, however, is determined by the character of the feed supply and by additional demands for growth and milk production. Only five elements are likely to be deficient in the ration of dairy cattle, namely, sodium, chlorine, iodine, calcium and phosphorus. Common salt furnishes sodium and chlorine. Phosphorus is the most likely mineral to be lacking other than those supplied by salt. </seg>
         <seg id="p221">¦ NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Dairymen should purchase the mineral supplements needed to bal - lZ\n^ ,mP? Tlyand DOt WaSte m°ney on worse worth - less complex mineral mixtures. dairv^tlv", an? Phosphorous are requiredin large amounts by dairy cattle due to the fact that about 90 per cent of the dry matter of the skeleton is made up of these two mineral elements, and milk li^v* h, lnCalCiUm and Phosphorus. In .human nutrition calcium is the mineral element most likely to be deficient in the diet flue to the fac t that people do not eat very much of the rough - ages which are usually good sources of this element. On the other hand cattle have a digestive tract, especially equipped to handle the high calcium roughages. Consequently, when cattle are fed liberally on roughages there is very little, likelihood of a calcium deficiency. ¦¦ ef"e dl^uSßing the requirements: of calcium and phosphorus we should say something about vitamin D which is necessary for the utilization of these two minerals. This vitamin may be obtained from sun-cured hay, cod liver oil, irradiated ergosterol, or irradiated roods. Green foods contain only small amouts of vitamin D con sequently.when cattle are on pasture the principal source of this factor comes from the. exposure of the animal to sunshine. Calves fed a rickets-producing ration were prevented from developing rickets by turning into sunshine daily. Also, rachitic calves were cured by exposure to sunshine. ¦ During the winter the potency of the sunshine in ultraviolet rays is so weak that calves develop rickets when fed a ration low in vitamin D and exposed to winter sunshinej Fortunately hay which .has been cured by direct exposure to sunshine contains suf - ficient vitamin D to prevent rickets in calves. , During the curing process the ultraviolet from the sun activates : certain compounds in the hay changing them into vitamin D. Since hay cured in the sun contains vitamin D and calves can use ultraviolet rays from the sun, the possibility of calves or cattle developing rickets due to a la/!k of this vitamin is remote. The use of cod liver oil under farm conditions is not indicated from a vitamin D standpoint. Since cattle receive ample vitamin D in ordinary farm rough - ages and sunshine, they utilize calcium efficiently. In experiments at the Michigan State College, milking cows on a ration of timothy hay, corn silage and a low calcium grain mixture utilized from 50 to 60 per cent of the calcium in their ration.. A supplement supply - ing calcium is not needed when plenty of roughage is fed, but in isolated cases low calcium roughages fed in limited amounts may need a cal.cium supplement. Finely ground lime stone rock, or special odorless steamed bone meal are good sources of this element </seg>
         <seg id="p222">KKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The mineral element most likely to be deficient in* the ration of dairy cattle is phosphorus. Results at the Michigan State College indicate that the first symptom of severe phosphorus deficiency is a loss of appetite for roughage. Of course the blood phosphorus drops before the effect on appetite is noticeable. Depraved or perverted appetite in cattle is manifested by eat - ing of materials not ordinarily classed as food, such as bone, wood, and hair. This .condition is usually associated with a slight phos - phorus deficiency. In experiments at the Michigan State College, cattle did not manifest depraved appetite while suffering from severe phosphorus deficiency. When these animals began to show signs of recovery as was indicated by greater appetite for roughage and an increased blood inorganic phosphorus, depraved appetite was .mani - fested. Depraved appetite, however, is not always an indication of phos - phorus deficiency. Calves frequently chew wood and other things not classed as food although plenty of phosphorus is present in the ration. Cows also may eat dirt and straw in the manure pile even though they are receiving ample phosphorus. Chewing of bones, wood or hair, by cows under farm conditions usually indicates that they are suffering from a deficiency of this element or are recovering from a severe phosphorus deficiency. The phosphorus requirement for growing calves is usually met by the rations ordinarily fed. Whole milk and skim milk, which are commonly fed to young calves, are rich in both calcium and phos - phorus. Protein concentrates such as wheat bran, wheat middlings, linseed meal, soybean oil meal, and .cotton seed meal also contain plenty of phosphorus. The phosphorus requirement depends to a large extent on the amount of milk production. The phosphorus content of alfalfa hay is usually low in common with other roughages. There is considerable variation in this re - spect, however, depending on condition of the soil, rainfall and leaf loss. The amount of bone meal needed to supplement a home grown ration consisting of corn silage, corn and alfalfa, with varying amounts of phosphorus is shown in Table I. </seg>

Other min - eral supplements made from raw rock phosphate may contain the element fluorine which is toxic to cattle. Fluorine affects the teeth causing them to become soft. Many expensive complex mineral mixtures are being fed to dairy cattle. These mixtures usually consist of various combina - tions of bonemeal, .calcium carbonate, common salt, copperas sul - phur, Glauber's salts, potassium or sodium iodide, hard wood ashes and charcoal; the theory behind such a mixture of thts sort is that if one mineral does not do the work another will. In the past the belief has been prevalent that if a mineral mixture failed to do good at least it would do no harm.

         <seg id="p224">KKJ'UKT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mineral mixture in addition to a basal ration, showed that such a mineral mixture may be harmful when fed over a long period. The complex mixture retarded body development and produced au unthrifty appearance. Most of these mixtures are low in phos - phorus, the mineral element most likely to be deficient in the ration of dairy cattle. Iron, copper and cobalt are needed in the dairy ration in small amounts for normal blood formation. When these elements are lack - ing in the feeds anemia results. The feeds usually contain plenty of these elements. Magnesium, manganese, potassium, sulphur and zinc are other mineral elements required by animals, which are amply supplied in the ordinary rations fed. A deficiency of iodine in the ration of pregnant cows results in the birth of calves with "big neck" or goiter. There is no need to feed a supplement supplying iodine on farms where goiter has never been observed in new-born calves. Extravagant claims are frequently made for the widespread use of various iodine supplements. The feeding of iodine will not build up resistance to various diseases such as sterility and infectious abortion (Bang's disease). Neither will such a supplement increase milk production or increase the efficiency of feed utilization. On farms where goiter occurs iodized salt may be purchased, or the dairyman may prepare idoized salt by mixing an oun.ce of pul - verized sodium or potassium iodide with 200 pounds of salt. This is done by mixing the potassium iodide with 20 pounds of salt and this mixture thoroughly mixed with the remaining salt. lodine is iodine regardless of its source. Organic and inorganic sources of iodine appear to be of about equal value to cattle. Some Metabolic Diseases Commonly Associated with Mineral De - ficiency. Milk fever is often referred to as the "disease of theories" since its cause is unknown. It is characterized by low blood calcium and high blood magnesium. Since the disease responds to .calcium in - jections, it is frequently associated with a calcium deficiency in the ration. Milk fever, however, Is not associated with the calcium content of the ration, and is just as likely to occur among cows on high-calcium rations as among those on low-.calcium rations. Grass tetany cattle is characterized by a low blood magnesium which is not associated with magnesium level of the ration. The cause of this disease is not known. Ketosis in cattle is sometimes </seg>

It never will become an article produced for a very </seg>
         <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 225 limited .market. This fact affects vitally our planning and discussions of this industry. It requires that our first consideration be a study of America and its population of 125 million souls. In taking an inventory of America we may be very astounded at the fact that we/are a relatively small group, considering the pop - ulation of the world. Yes, we have in America only 7 per cent of t&gt; world's people, and we live on only 6 per cent of the total world land area. Now what about getting before us the worldly possessions of these folk'who live in America? If we are to measure them in rail - roads, we must credit 32 per cent of all railroads as owned in America. When it comes to automobiles, we own 76 per cent of all owned in the entire world. Thirty-three per cent of all radio stations and 44 per cent of all radio receiving sets are owned by this 7 per cent of all humans in the world today. Surely we must have something in America if these items be a measure of standards of living, wealth, or whatever you would prefer to call it. We can get a further picture of what we have in America by a study of goods consumed. Here the facts are startling. One-half of the world's supply of coffee; one-half of its rubber; one-halt of its sugar; three-fourths of its silk; one-third of its coal, and two - thirds of its petroleum are consumed right here by one-fourteenth of all the people in the world. Certainly we are using things in this land of ours away above and beyond others in less fortunate lands. ¦ What about our natural resources compared with those in the world? So far as oil is concerned, we have 60 per cent of the world's total supply. We have 48 per cent of its copper, 45 per cent of its Pig iron, 47 per cent of the steel, 58 per .cent of the corn, and 56 per cent of the cotton. Concerning standards of living, we own twice as many homes per thousand population as folks in other lands, four times as much electricity, seven times as many automobiles. When we .consider banking resources, we actually have in our banks a total of eleven billion dollars. Saving accounts total thirty-eight million and have a total value of two billion dollars. Life insurance policies number 31,500,000 and these have a total value of 70 billion dollars. The purchasing power of Americans compared with that of folks living In other countries is something of tremendous value as we take inventory of what we have in America. The 125 million people living in America have as much purchasing power as 500 million living in Europe or a billion in Asia. We spend in America upwards of three billion dollars a year for education. This is more than the rest of the world spends/ </seg>
         <seg id="p228">HKI'MRT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICIXTrRE We have been using big figures in looking at America as the market for the milk and dairy products coming from our farms. To get a true picture, however, divide the wealth of this country, the greatest by far in the world, right down to what the average person would own, were everything equally divided. It would be a sum total of $3600 worth of goods, only $39 of which would be cash. The rest would have to be taken out in bricks from a sky - scraper, a wheel from a tractor, a bulb from an electric light fixture, a street lamp, or a ton of feathers. In other words, a great part of our wealth is in construction—buildings, roads, churches, stores, homes, and what not. i The average income of the people of this fair land is not as we sometimes think, a fabulous five or six figure number; it is merely ?500 per year. Our price possibilities are, therefore,'rather limited. Price is to a considerable extent but a will-of-the-wisp, or pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. If we are to increase farm income, wealth, and standards of living, our big possibilities are going to be in the field of efficiency, and in the application of scien - tific research that will show us how to produce farm goods for less. Sad as it may seem, our agricultural price structure may neces - sarily receive a few jolts downward. Market agreements and the licensing acts in many fluid milk markets have maintained a high price to customers. How much of this artificial maintenance of a high price for fluid milk has cut consumption because consumers could not afford to buy? How much of this refused fluid milk has gone back into the butter tub. cheese vat, and other manufactured products is not something many folks have been talking about. Add to this a growing tendency to let foreign produced dairy products in at re - duced tariffs and you have our price structure tottering just a bit. It isn't a bad idea to look about in search of a way to sell for less and yet make more farm income. One avenue for accomplishment of the above and within the reach of practically all dairy farmers is to market their farm crops through better producing or more efficient cows. lowa .cow testing figures show that cows producing 125 pounds of fat a year have a feed cost of 36 cents per pound of fat. A 300 pound fat .cow charges but 21 cents for feed per pound of fat; while a 500 pound fat cow produces a pound of fat for a feed cost of 16 cents. Not only do better cows produce more fat to sell, but in addition, a greater profit is realized on each pound produced. If butter fat sells for 30 cents, the more 125 pound fat cows you milk—the more you lose. One 500 pound fat cow will still realize a profit of about $80; one 300 pound fat cow will realize a profit of about $30. Herds that would produce as much as 500 pounds fat per cow are not too numerous and we would not suggest a goal so high. How- </seg>
         <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION ever, with the use of scientific knowledge in feeding, breeding man - agement, and disease control available today, our herds can be brought to a .300..t0 400 pound level with a corresponding increase in farm income from the dairy enterprise. ¦ . Another approach by which farmers may get more income and still sell their milk for less, is to bring about a more equitable share of the consumer's dollar. Processing, manufacturing, and distribut - ing costs money. In many pases the consumer asks for the most expensive handling, such as delivering a small bottle of milk to his very doorstep. However, laws and pressure have proved some groups at the expense of the dairy farmer and producer. Organized labor has gobbled up more than its share of the con - sumer's dollar in the milk world. Just by way of illustration, labor's share in the Minneapolis area has risen 300 per cent over the past twenty-year period while the farmer's share has dropped 30 per cent. Milk instead of selling for 90 cents per hundred today would be selling for $7.70 if the farmer had fared as well in legislative halls as has organized labor. That price is beyond all attainment but it does serve,to show that others in the scheme of things could do more work, handle more goods, in other words, bring about some of the same efficiency that the farmer is forced to .practice with a corres - ponding increase in consumption and a better and more lasting re - turn to all concerned. If all cooperators do not seek a greater efficiency, some new marketing,scheme will come forth that will take the pla.ce of daily milk delivery to the doorstep, and a high wage scale with no jobs will be the; result for those who seek to protect their own interests irrespective of: the producer and the .consumer.

Carbohydrates, fats and proteins supply energy. Carbohy - drates and proteins supply four calories per gram. Fats supply nine calories per gram. Fatty acids are obtained from fats. Some fatty acids are essential for proper nutrition in certain species. B. Protein. No known life without protein. Protein furnishes essential ammo acids. At least twenty-two ammo acids are known. Some of these must be supplied in the diet. Growth period (1-25 years of age), body weight increases about twenty times.

Salts formed from minerals govern: a. Contractility of muscles. Muscle in solution of Ca, Na and X chlorides will contract when stimulated. Remove the Ca and contraction ceases. b. Irritability of nerves. Nerves do not respond to stimuli except when bathed in suitable salt solution. c. Solvent power and osmotic pressure of body fluids. Foods pass from intestines into the blood. Liquids pass from blood to organs and tissues. Waste materials pass from cells into the blood, and from blood to kidneys. The interaction between mineral elements bring about these processes. .-¦¦ d. Coagulation of blood. Ca is important in this coagulation. c. Reaction of digestive juices. Pepsin digestion in the stomach depends upon the proper acidity. Digestion in the intestine depends upon proper alkalinity. Mineral salts govern these reactions. f. Neutrality of blood.

Please pardon SeveTT'J TV,*" °Wa coun* ™st o' tnetime as I beUeve that the points I want to make can be best illustrated in that way because I am more familiar with the details there. The first definite Junior Dairy Program in Hamilton County was started about the year 1922-when *0 purebred Holstein calves were purchased by the county bankers' association and distributed to boys in each bank's territory. Eight clubs were organized with 5 boys in each club. The calves were given to the boys with the agreement that they would take good care of them, breed Cm to purebred Holstein bulls and then give the first heifer caff back o the bankers' association at 2 months of age. This calf would' then be &amp; iven to some other boy in order to perpetuate the club and in - crease the number of good dairy cattle in the county. : What was the result of this program? A number of good founaation females were brought into the county and for a few years the results seemed to be good. But soon the dubs became somewhat seatered, good purebred sires with production records were not available and most of the purebred heifers and their offspring were cross bred or bred to grade or scrub bulls. This type of a breeding program soon resulted in inferior calves which were not fit to pass on to another boy for a club or breeding project. So this first Junior Dairy Program gradually died out and now only a few good herds in the county can be traced to the Original heifers. Why did this program result in that way? As I see it, because only the first step of a successful dairy program was considered that is the foundation females. The next step, the right kind of a'herd sire, and most of you have found it to be the most important step was considered in a way, but no definite provisions were made to guarantee the availability of a good sire. This meant, that the off spring of the original good heifers decreased in production instead </seg>
         <seg id="p246">RKFORT lIF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of increasing. Also the calves became poorer in type instead of im - proving, or at least holding their own. There was no joy or pride in ownership of these calves lor the boys, consequently they failed to take the interest and give them the ,care that they should have. Also the third step in a good dairy program, plans for testing and adequate records of some kind, was not considered. This meant that the boys had no definite indication of the ability of the animals to produce, of the butterfat test of their milk or of the actual profit or loss on the project. The next definite Junior Dairy Program In Hamilton County was started in 1933. The old perpetual clubs had died out and at that time it was necessary for the individual club members to buy their own heifers. This meant that when they had their own money, in - vested in them, that they took more interest, gave them better care and really tried to learn more about the problems involved. They had to decide on a breed, contact breeders, and make selections of the calves they wanted which meant some preliminary study and thought. This acted as a motivating influence for club lessons and helped to create a permanent interest in good dairy cattle. The first step being solved in this way, the next one was to be sure that they had available the right kind of a sire to mate with their good heifers. In the fall of 1933 the dairy extension specialist and myself spent some time visiting and talking with active and former club members about the possibility of organizing some junior bullring associations. Much interest developed so 10 Holstein and 3 Jersey hull calves were purchased from breeders at very low prices. These breeders practically gave the associations the bulls for the cost of registration, because they realized the necessity of good sires in a dairy program. There were about 40 members in these associations divided into 13 blocks with from 1 to 4 members in a block, depend - ing upon geographical location. Each block decides for themselves how they handle the bull in their block. Some move him from farm to farm as he is needed and some keep him at one place all of the time where there is a bull pen. This means that the members or members there has to feed and care for him but the other members must bring their cows to him for service. The father of the club mem her also has the privilege of using the association bull on his cows. This means that an average of nearly 300 cows have been bred to the associations' bulls each year since the start. Every 2 years about Fair time in the fall the bulls are rotated, that is, they are moved to another block in regular sequence. Us - ally twice a year an inspection tour is held by the Extension. Dairy Specialist and myself to see that the animals are getting the right kind of care and to observe the results. Sometimes it is necessary </seg>

Corn value means the fuel value compared to that of corn. The abrupt drop in feeding value of plants prior to maturity is associated with lignification. Llgnification is a term used to describe a toughening process which occurs in plants in order to strengthen the stem. This process is desirable in cereal grains to prevent lodging. In feeds, however, the effect is negative. The deposition of lignin locks up the nutrients so that the animal cannot use them. This is shown by the following table. Table 11. Digestion Coefficients of Cellulose in Non-lignified and Lignified Feeding Stuffs. Non-lignified Feeds Digestion Coefficient Beet pulp (dried) 81 2 weeks pasture grass 81 5 weeks pasture grass 79 MaDgolds 78 Cabbage 91 Lignified Feeds Very good meadow hay 66 Good meadow hay 57 Poor meadow hay 47 Alfalfa hay 43 Oat straw 59 Wheat straw 40 The utilization of pasture means that the animal uses the grass before the nutrients are locked up. How much of highly digestible and highly nutritious pasture grass do cattle eat daily? The results of Woodward and others indicate that dairy cows consume about 30 to 35 pounds of dry matter daily of good pasture. This amount furnishes sufficient nutrients for maintenance and the production of more than a pound of butterfat daily. The young pasture grass is high in carotene which changes to vitamin A in the cow's body. Consequently, milk from pasture fed cows is very rich in vitamin A. Milk is the principal source of this factor in the human dietary. The preservation of grass and legumes for winter feeding has been the dream of many people. We need a grass -which ¦will give a high yield of dry matter per acre per cutting when harvested before lignification locks up the nutrients. We also need a method of preserving such a feed without loss of nutrients. The silo may be a way out. </seg>

Rations which are not balanced are wasteful. WJiy should a farmer work hard raising corn to waste in an unbalanced ration? Alfalfa hay has revolutionized the feeding of dairy cattle in many sections of the United States. This has been due to the high protein content and superior yield of alfalfa when compared to timothy hay, corn stover, etc. Dairy cattle consume enormous quantities ot alfalfa .hay. Hol - stein cows 'consume 35 to 50 pounds of alfalfa hay per day when it is appetizing. Graves and associates reported that cows fed al - falfa hay alone produced on the average of 376 pounds of butterfat a year. This work shows the possibility of greater utilization of alfalfa w.hen methods of preserving the nutrients and appetizing factors have been worked out. Results at Kansas, Oregon and Michigan Experiment Stations showed that ordinary alfalfa hay produced in those sections did not produce as;much milk as the total digestible nutrient content in - dicated. Experiments at Michigan show that cereal grains, corn, oats and barley, are good supplements to feed with alfalfa. A method of feeding alfalfa; corn silage, corn and bone meal is illustrated in the following tables. </seg>

Bureau of Animal Industry to discuss Bang's disease control. BANGS DISEASE (INFECTIOUS ABORTION) OF CATTLE J. W. Murdock, United States Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal Industry, Local Office Lincoln, Nebraska During the year of 1934 it was estimated that there were ap - proximately 10,000,000 surplus cattle in the United States, at which time various plans were discussed with a view of reducing in an orderly manner this apparent surplus of cattle. One plan that received serious consideration was to set up a production testing organisation for the purpose of identifying low producing dairy cows with a view of having such animals slaughtered and a small sum per head be paid the owner in addition to proceeds derived from sale for slaughter of such animals. About that time a sizeable group of cattle owners and livestock sanitarians advanced the argument that if steps were to be taken to reduce the cattle population, those slaughtered should be the diseased cattle, especially those infected with tuberculosis and Bang's disease. The latter disease is commonly termed infectious abortion. Before such a program got under way the unprecedented drought visited a large portion of the country and it then became necessary to slaughter approximately 10,000,000 cattle because of lack of feed and water. Following that emergency cattle purchase program the Bang's disease program was undertaken as a disease elimiration program and not as a continuation of the cattle reduction program as many frequently indicate. When lunds, approximately $25,000,000, were made available for combating Bang's disease there was no established uniform plan under which to proceed on a nation-wide basis but several of the state.-; had already undertaken Bang's disease work under plans re - garded as the most workable, available funds and various other con - ditions considered. </seg>

It would seem important that the cattle owners of Nebraska consider carefully the advisability of sponsoring state legislation that would provide funds for use in aggressively prosecuting Bang's disease work, bearing in mind that if the disease is permitted to advance unmolested its toll will increase from year to year and other states that do provide funds and actively engage in Bang's disease elimination work will seek to protect their investments in such work and will likely impose restrictions on breeding cattle offered for movement into their states from states that fail to make adequate provision for an aggressive campaign against Bang's disease. In this same connection, breeders of purebred cattle who fail to render their herds free from Bang's disease are finding it in - creasingly difficult to attract buyers, especially those buyers who have experienced or observed the advantages gained by eliminating Uanii't disease.

Milk in the paunch of the young calf ferments and the end products of such fermentation appear to upset the normal digestive processes. Consequently, it is better to underfeed on milk during the first month. The calf has a difficult time adjusting itself to its paunch. This is why call raising by hand sometimes ends in failure. The kind of Kerms which the calf needs in its paunch are probably difficult to establish until it starts to chew its cud. Tails with attached nipples are sometimes used to insure that milk dees not pass into the pounch. In order to prevent calves from sucking each other they should be placed in stanchions and fed grain after they have drunk their milk. It is better to feed calves three times daily during the first two or three weeks. The milk temperature at feeding time should be about 1000 F. The amount of milk fed should be weighed and the calves should be fed individually. Pails should be kept clean. Usually whole milk is too expensive to feed to calves after they are 10 days or two weeks old. In sections where butterfat is sold, skim milk is usually available for calf feeding. Not more than 14 to IB pounds per day should be fed. Corn and oats make a good K rain mixture to feed with skim milk. These grains may be fed whole or coarsely ground. Hay of good quality should be offered the calves at about one week of age. Such a ration usually gives satisfactory results. On farms where whole milk is sold either reconstituted skim milk or a dry calf starter is used. Reconstituted dry skim milk is made by mixing one part by weight of dry skim milk with 9 parts by weight of water. The resulting mixture is equal to fresh liquid skim milk. In mixing dry skim milk always put it on the water and then mix. Calf starters have improved markedly during the past few years due to the fact that more information has been learned about the calf's requirements. There are several good calf starters on the market. Good home made calf starters may be used. A few good calf starters are as follows: No. 1. 30 lb. yellow corn (coarsely ground) 30 lb. oats (coarsely ground) 20 lb. skim milk powder 10 \b. linseed meal or soybean oil meal 10 lb. wheat bran 1% calcium carbonate .5% salt </seg>

Dairymen, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin Nebraska Dairymen's Association December 9, 1938 Paper presented before the Annual Meeting of the Nebraska I Guernsey Cattle Club, December 9, 1938 It is.best to appreciate that our suggestion for pedigree choos - ing of a herd sire is what might be called a model to be used as a guide or help on this feature of our breeding work. The model for type may never be reached by any individual of the breed for which it is prepared but it offers a standard of excellence to tie to never - theless. The type model is not wrong just because there are not herds of individuals all over America that measure up to it. The guide posts we may set up as an aid to selecting the right young bull do not in any manner minimize the necessity of continued testing and proving of this chosen sire at as early an age as possible. We have never read many receipes telling young women how to pick out; the right husband or vice versa. Maybe the need is not so apparent in the human family as in the bovine family. How - ever, one bit of advice given to young men more than 2,500 years ago is going to be the theme of our story on selecting the right dairy seed stock. This ancient proverb read something like this: "If you would have good children, marry not the only good girl in the clan." In other words; look to the sisters, the cousins, the aunts, and the uncles as well as to the individual and her father and mother. And so [in our pedigree selection of dairy seed stock we must look to the to find the true worth of the individual so far as its transmitting ability is concerned. : : ¦ '.' ¦ . ¦"¦..,:¦;. ¦¦i-.'¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p260">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Acceptable Type We're off now on a sire hunt. No young bull is going to get much consideration unless he himself measures up to standards for type that we have built up in our own mind. We realize that we can have poor type animals that are real producers and we can have good type cows that are counterfeits, but as long as type and pro - duction are inherited separately, we can select for both and even - tually build up animals whose economic value Is greater because they are of acceptable type in addition to their producing ability. But to get back to our theme. The sisters of this young sire we are looking at tell us more about the type he will hand down to his daughters than does his own conformation. If he and his sisters are all of acceptable type, we have reasonable assurance that hi 3 inheritance is pure for that character. If some sisters are very good and some very poor. Mr. Sire is probably mixed In his inher - itance and will hand all sorts of type down to hfs daughters. Consider the Dam We are by no means through when we find a sire at a price we can pay, one that looks good and whose sisters look uniformly good to us. We now walk down the row of stanchions to look up our young hopeful's mother. Has she a record of better than 400 lbs. fat on regular herd care? Has she produced 1,050 lbs. fat in 1,000 days and do these three consecutive yearly records average as good or better than the long time records of the better cows in our herd at home? What are the records of her daughters? Are these uniform or is one high and another low? Remember the daughters of this dam are sisters to the sire you are looking up and sisters tell a story that we can best bank on. Now for the sisters to this dam. They are easiest found by asking if the sire of this dam is proved and how is he proved. Is the average of his daughters more than their dams? Bid he in - crease 60 per cent or more of his daughters over their dams? Were the records of the dams of these daughters as good or better than the records of the best cows in our herd? What About the Sire Its now important that we move on down to the bull pen and see the sire of the calf that thus far measures up to our expectations. This is no time to "let up" on getting at the inheritance that we may expect in the bull we want to buy. If this sire is proved, our questions need not be so many.

Rembmberj again, daughters of this sire are sisters to the bull calves we have looked at and we are going to find coming from this young - ster, when, he matures, much the same picture as we actually see in his sisters. If the bulljin the pen is a young bull, say, a three-year-old or so of course he cannot be proved. In this case a study of his daughters is merely helpful from the type standpoint. Here we must find out if his dam, the granddam of the calf we are interested in, would meet the requirements of the dam discussed above. Further, is the grandsire proved and proved good under the terms mentioned just above for the sire. Records in Pedigree These recommendations for buying a sire are somewhat different from those we have been generally following. The difference is best told bjy an actual instance that came to our attention. A bull was offered for sale showing in his pedigree an average of 800 lbs. fat on his six nearest dams. If we spend money on the information A that sisters tell:us, the average of six records in three generations is not too important. Instead of this insignificant number of records, we need upwards of 300 to get at the information on lifetime and sister records. We actually found in the first three generations of • the sire mentioned above 366 records that averaged 557 lbs. fat. Where to go to find such a bull as outlined above ? You must go to the man who has been testing every cow in his herd. He can give you much of the information you need to make a wise selection. How to Breed Good Young Bolls How to breed the kind of sire we talk about? Your herd of cattle should be enrolled under the herd test banner, either cow testing, the regular breed herd improvement test or in such advanced reg - istry or record of merit -work that tests every cow. As you prove the sire at the head of your herd, and as you eliminate the low pro - ducing females and locate the real brood cows, you are getting your affairs In line to capitalize on the better sire demands of the future. By way of illustration of a pedigree that tells a story truly worthy of our study in sire selection, we briefly submit the Ayrshire bull, Penshurst Last..Man. In the first three generations of his pedigree are to be found 524 lbs. fat; and ,his older daughter has furnished 442 lbs. fat as a two-year-old. </seg>
         <seg id="p262">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The sire of Last Man was Penshurst Man 0' War, with an index of 448 lbs. fat calculated from 160 daughters. His sire has an index of 415 lbs. fat and the two sires back of him have indexes of 421 and 397 lbs. fat, respectively. The dam of Man O' War has nine records averaging 475 lbs. fat and seven daughters with 33 records averaging 463 lbs. fat. On the dam's side of the pedigree,—Last Man's mother is a daughter of his sire. That brings down four high index sires and the great brood cow dam of Man 0' War to the bottom of the pedigree. This Man 0' War daughter was from a dam with an index sire of 483 lbs. fat. Here we have data galore. Year in and year out production. We have sires proved by their daughters' records and cows with not only good lifetime records but daughters with records equally as good. A pedigree that enables us to use good judgment and some accuracy in deciding if he is the bull we want to take home or if he is the bull to be left alone. FEEDING PROGRAM FOR NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN H. P. Davis Professor of Dairy Husbandry University of Nebraska Paper presented before the Annual Meeting of the Nebraska Guernsey cattle club Dec. 9, 1938 Each state has its particular problems with reference to dairy cattle feeding over and above those which are common in every part of the country. Of the common problems, that of obtaining a balanced ration at the lowest possible cost is perhaps the most important. In Nebraska this problem is a vital one, but since it is one which is common to every part of the United States, this discussion will be limited to problems which are particularly im - portant in our state. One has to understand the problems in order to present a program which may be useful in solving these problems. PROBLEMS IX NEBRASKA DAIRY CATTLE FEEJDING 1. The providing of adequate pasture is perhaps one of the most vital problems faced by dairy cattle feeders in Nebraska. Pas - ture is the natural feed for dairy cows and its many useful qualities </seg>
         <seg id="p263">.NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S' ASSOCIATION 261 are beng more appreciated each day. As a general thing pasture tends to furnish a balanced ration from the standpoint of protein an«l carbohydrates. It also contains plenty of vitamins A, E, and D Pasture also under most conditions tends to furnish most of the minerals necessary for adequate nutrition. If this pasture is avail - able for cows of average production the feeding problem is very well solved for the pasture season. Unfortunately in this climate pasture is not a certain crop, and eicept under irrigated conditions it usually does not furnish adequate feed for dairy cows for more than two months. This lack of pasture brings on a good many nutritional difficulties. : ' 2. The second great problem is the raising of a legume rough - age. While it is true that alfalfa can be grown in many parts of Nebraska, ;it is not yet certain that alfalfa is the legume crop to grow on upland soils. Since a legume roughage is quite necessary for economical production, some legume must be found to serve our purpose. ; .. " 3. On many farms there is a surplus of carbohydrates rough - age which is used to furnish an adequately balanced ration requires a supplement in the form of grain that contains a high percentage of protein. :' 4. There fs considerable evidence that in certain parts of Ne - braska there is a shortage of phosphorus in the soil which tends to reduce the phosphorous in the feeds. grown upon the soil and con - sequently to produce an unbalanced mineral nutrition. There may also be cases where there is a shortage of lime and in some cases perhaps an iodine deficiency. PROGRAM FOR FEEDING DAIRY CATTMJ IN NEBRASKA In the previous discussion only four important feeding problems have been mentioned, but they are four which are quite necessary to solve if a sensible program for feeding dairy cattle is to be pro - vided. :¦'..' ; Since pasture is a vital problem, any program of feeding must consider what can be done to provide adequate pasture. Various combinations of grasses have been suggested by the agronomists as a means of providing a more satisfactory permanent pasture. Whether they have reached the best combination with brome grass and al - falfa, time will tell. It appears that there may be good possibilities in the use of some of our native short grasses for pasture in eastern parts of the state and work is being carried on along this line. Meanwhile farmers may try out different grasses and combinations of grasses with the possibility of finding some strains of grasses or combinations of grasses which may furnish pasture for a much </seg>
         <seg id="p264">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 262 longer period. Pending the finding of such grasses a plan of using various crops for temporary pasture can be used. For late fall pasture either wheat or rye has proved to be very useful, and these same crops will again furnish pasture in the early spring. While it is likely that a somewhat larger tonnage can be obtained from rye, because of its greater stooling ability and its tendency to be finer, many prefer wheat for this purpose. There is some indication also, that cows pastured on wheat do not produce milk with quite as strong an "off" flavor as sometimes develops on rye pasture. If it has been sowed in the spring, sweet clover will be coming along to furnish pasture soon after the rye or wheat is finished. The rye or wheat ground can be plowed up and planted to sudan grass which will usually furnish quite a good deal of pasture through the middle of the summer. If care is taken to select pure seed and to keep it pastured rather closely the danger from sudan grass poisoning is very greatly reduced. If fall rains came on, the sweet clover may perk up a bit so as to furnish early fall pasture, and then wheat or rye seeded early completes the cycle. Many objec - tions can be raised to this arrangement which does require consider - able labor, but pending the development of a pasture grass or grasses which will last through our summer, it is believed the suggestions made are useful. If this cannot be followed, silage put up with molasses is probably the best substitute for pasture. There is no satisfactory substitute for legume roughage in the feeding of dairy cattle. It is true, cows can be fed on other feeds, but in general it is difficult to furnish a balanced ration and yet to maintain a herd in good health without somewhat greater ex - pense that is incurred in the use of such roughage. Obviously, the ideal way is to produce the legume roughage on the farm. Where this can be done as with alfalfa hay, that is to be advocated. On upland soils where alfalfa hay does not do well, it seems logical to believe that one of the crops which will be used for hay will be soy - beans. Soybean hay, while somewhat coarser than alfalfa, is very pala - table and has as high a feeding value as alfalfa. There may be some other legume will be found to be suited for Nebraska con - ditions; but certainly some legume hay must be fed. The roughages which are likely to be produced in an ordinary plan of crop rotation in Nebraska will probably show a surplus of feeding elements belonging to the carbohydrate group. In other words, there will be corn fodder and sorghum fodder produced in abundance. Obviously these feeds should be used to the best ad - vantage and should not be wasted. It is quite certain that car - bohydrate roughages of the kinds mentioned can be best preserved in the form of silage, since in that form the food nutrients are pre - served to the best advantage. Dry corn fodder and dry sorghum </seg>
         <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA .STATE.'DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION fodder do have a feeding value but they are not particularly pal - atable when fed in that form and are not especially stimulating to milk production, experiments have indicated that if molasses is added to green corn or sorghum fodder in the proportion of 50 pounds to the-ton-of green fodder when the material is put into the silo that there is a very much greater preservation of the vitamins in the feed. There is considerable indication that on many farms where pasture is lacking and where a good quality of legume roughage is not readily available that cows may be suffering from a lack of vitamins, particularly vitamin A, and in consequence this may affect to some extent their regularity of breeding and it certainly affects the quality of milk produced under such circumstances. It is there - fore believed that the proper preservation of these non-legume roughages is one of the features of a dairy feeding program. When legume hay is grown on ordinary soil, that is not greatly deficient in phosphorous and calcium, it is one of the important sources of those elements, particularly calcium. When a roughage ration is fed consisting of corn fodder, corn silage, sorghum fodder or sorghum silage, there is considerable likelihood that the ration, unless it is supplemented by the ingredients in the grain mixture, will be lacking in phosphorous and calcium. Research has indica - ted that these two elements are more important in dairy cattle nu - trition than was previously believed. They must be present in abundance and the proper relationship of one to the other must also be maintained. Both are essential to milk production; both are essential also to reproduction, so that any lack or an unbalance of these elements is likely to cause serious difficulties. That does not mean that if non-legume roughage is used that the feeding of lline flour will take the place of alfalfa hay, although! it may help to supply some of the calcium which is lacking in the ration. lodine may be lacking In certain parts of Nebraska although there is no evidence of any wide-spread lack of this element. Because of the possibility of shortage, it is suggested that the use of iodized salt, which is but a little more expensive than ordinary salt, is a good method of preventing difficulty. A simple way of using minerals is to add to the grain mixture one per cent each of steamed bone meal, lime flour, and iodized salt, and also to have boxes filled with a mixture of three parts iodized salt, one part steamed bone meal to which the animals can have access at will. It must be remembered also that bran is a particularly good source of phosphorous and that cottonseed meal and linseed meal are good sources of that mineral also."--'' :¦ .'

         <seg id="p266">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 264 it is necessary to feed a balanced ration which includes not only adequate protein and minerals, but also plenty of vitamins. This feeding program should consist of as much pasture as can be econ - omically provided, supplemented by the use of legume hay and non - legume roughages primarily as silage. When this is done and the grain mixture contains bran and some high protein concentrate, usually the mineral requirements of the ration will have been ful - filled; but in case they have not, adequate supply should be pro - vided through the use of steam bone meal, lime flour, and iodized salt. Grain mixtures should therefore be balanced to supplement the roughages, using as far as possible home grown grains, but re - membering that adequate protein of the proper kind is necessary for dairy cattle which may require the purchase of high protein con - centrates and that these also supply needed minerals.

In Columbus, Ohio, the first thing of especial interest was the size of the hotel. The Deshler-Wallick has 1,000 rooms, very nice rooms and furniture and good service. We went on the elevator to the 30th floor. Had the weather been clear we could have gone to the top of the tower and viewed the city and surrounding country.

We enjoyed very much seeing the different towns, how the crops were In other states and the most Important of all the beautiful scenery. There were very few of us that had ever seen trees with such beautiful colors in leaves before. The leaves on the oak and maple trees stood out with their fiery red color. We enjoyed the riding both Thursday and Friday. We arrived in Columbus Friday evening, after registering at the Deshler-Wallick Hotel and taking a thorough inspection of our rooms we went to a show. We saw one of the most beautiful theatres in Columbus. We enjoyed sitting in the lobby that evening for a while and getting acquainted with some of the 4-H-ers from other states.

This year my trip to the National Dairy Show was a highlight in my club work. I enjoyed the traveling, even though it was from Thursday morning un - til Friday evening. The scenery and country through Indiana and Ohio was especially beautiful. In my mind I can picture brilliant red, sold, and bright orange trees. Words fail me when I try to de - scribe them to my friends. The farming districts were also inter - esting. It made me more optimistic to see farmers hauling heaping loads of yellow corn they had husked. 1 will never forget Columbus, Ohio, with its Ohio State University, State Fail Grounds, State Capitol, Deshler-Wallick Hotel, and other points of interest. The Deshler-Wallick leaves fond memories in my mind. I shall never forget the new friends we met and good times we had in this hotel. The Ohio State University with its unique museum and con - venient arrangement leaves another memory in my mind. The dairy department of this university was also interesting to me. Although the capitol of Columbus is not as beautiful as Nebraska's, which is hard to beat, it still was very interesting to see. I remem - ber the State Fair Grounds as the place we gave our demonstration. I enjoyed giving our demonstration as well as hearing other demon - strations. Each demonstration gave me new ideas Banquets seemed to be in order or at hand—you know it's always lair weather when good food and good appetite get together. We 4-H-ers all appreciate Mr. Kraft, heard of Kraft-Phenix Cheese Cor - poration, for the wonderful banquet he gave us. I also enjoyed the speakers and entertainment that evening. The annual dinner was held on Tuesday evening. I was especially interested to know all about the scholarships and prizes offered to winning 4-H-ers. Sunday morning service at First Congregational Church was inspir - ing. I enjoyed the music as well as the sermon. Omar, the name known to all Nebraska royally entertained us at a dinner; following the splendid dinner we enjoyed a tour through the bakery.

The songs sung were "America", "Auld Lang Syne, Joy to the World"! and AXove Dream". In the spring of 1938, Mrs. Tullis composed a song for the project clubs entitled "Our Project Club" which was also sung. : The audience was asked to stand and give the Club Collect. The Collect "Keep us, 0 God, from pettiness. Let us be large in thought, in word, in deed. . Let us be done with fault-finding and leave off self-seeking May we put away all pretense and meet each other face to face, without self pity and without prejudice.

This year we hope that these programs about The Worth While Things of Life will continue to help you strive for further enrichment of your family living. Just a short time ago we observed Thanksgiving, and now, fast approaching, is Christmas with its mesage of Peace on Earth, Good will toward Men. These holidays bring to mind the ending of a simple grace. "Lord, make us truly thankful". In these times of war and rumors of war it seems to have a special meaning for us. Lord, make us truly thankful that with so many countries of the world in turmoil and strife, in chaos and desolation, we Americans can gather those we love about us for a real Thanksgiving of peace and plenty, joy and happiness. Let us cherish our homes more than ever before as we think of those mothers and children across the seas, homeless exiles. i Let us give thanks for this year now drawing to a close. It has been a good year. True, it is, there has been plenty of troubles for the world, for our nation, in our neighborhoods, perhaps even in our own homes. Even so, it's been a good year. Why? Allow me to quote "It is good to be living creatures, to have bodies and minds, to see sky overhead and feel a whole wide world under our feet, to .have work to do and a home to be in, to share the company of neighbors and friends and family, especially of children; to have song and books, beauty and fragrance, faith and dreams —all those millions of privileges and responsibilities that go into the making of a life." Last month I read with keen interest the following statements: "Amercia's home life has been one of her greatest sources of pride. </seg>
         <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 299 Today the future of the family life of our country Is at stake. Homes of the Future are not in the hands of Fate but In onr own. We have in our homes today the Home Builders of Tomorrow. What Is the ruture of the American family?" What a ringing challenge to the home builders of today! Have we been shirking some of our obligations to our youth? Don't we possess enough conviction and determination to cope with this vital issue? We must reposses ourselve of the steadfast faith, the daunt - less courage and the unbounded hope of our pioneered parents that we may fashion good citizens for the future. We can do it for it has been done. V I have never heard nor read a finer tribute to parents and the home they builded so well as this excerpt: of a letter written by one of seven children. "They taught us to fear nothing, love each other, ten the truth, and be proud we were Amercians with six genera - tions of Americans back of us, the finest I blood in the land They taught us to be pioneers in any work we did and seek the better Plans,, the frontiers of the mind that we might conquer. They gave us happiness, peace, joy and hope. I love life, people, nature, music - and all because two fine young people some forty years ago loved each other with a very great love, wanted( children, had them, gave them what they could, never too much of the material things, but so rich in the things of the spirit that seven lives have gone out into this world to make It a better place to live in."

' A short time ago a young man in college went .home for an unexpected week-end visit. It rather perplexed his parents for it was an expensive trip, and money, as we are all aware, Isn't any too plentiful these days. Wise parents they were for they welcomed him, enjoyed his visit, and asked no questions. A few days after his return to school they received a letter from him. He wrote - "l know you wondered at my coming home as I did but I felt I had to do so. Many things have been disturbing me lately, unsettling my faith, overturning my philosophy, bringing doubt to .my soul I just had to see you and to get within the atmosphere of home to feel that sureness of everything again. And I found it."

I want to share with you the worth while things I found in this poem entitled Thanksgiving. I do not know the name of the author: Thanksgiving j Thankful for the glory of the old Red, White, and Blue, For the spirt of America that is still staunch and true. j For the laughter of our children and the sunlight in their eyes And the joy of radiant mothers and their evening lullabies. And thankful that our harvests wear no taint of blood today | But were sown and reaped by toilers who were light cf heart and gay, Thankful for the riches that are ours to claim and keep. The joy of honest labor and the boon of happy sleep Far each little family circle where there is no empty char Save that God has sent the sorrow for the loving hearts to bear, And thankful for the loyal and brave souls of the past Who builded that contentment should be with us to the last, Thankful for the plenty that our peaceful land has blessed, For the rising sun that beckons every man to do his best; For the goal that lies before him and the promise whei he sows That his hand shall reap the harvest undisturbed by cruel foes; For the flaming torch of justice symbolizing as it burns Here none may rob the toiler of the prize he fairly earns. Giving thanks at this time of year for the riches that are ours For the red fruits of the orchards and the perfume of the flowers For our homes with laughter ringing and our hearth fireii blazing bright, j For our land of peace and plenty and our land of truth and right. I And we're thankful for the glory of the old Red, White 1, and Blue, j For the spirit of America that still is staunch and true. [ </seg>
         <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 301 Miss Fedde: I know it will be a thought that we will carry with us through the week, through the years to come and until we meet again I feel very much encouraged, though some people feel that the family s being jeopardized. So one of the things we are most interested in this morning is the promotion of family life. I am also happy to see so many here early to see the exhibits At this time I am happy to present Miss Mary Runnalls, home man - agement specialist of the agricultural extension service, Miss Run - nails. Miss Runnalls: We hope that you will enjoy looking at the exhibits during the week. I haven't done very much with the exhibits, but I would like to have the folks who have worked with them'give a brief explana - tion of each. First, Miss Johnson is in charge of the book exhibit that comes to us from the Nebraska Public Library Commission. Miss Johnson: ;: This exhibit is designed to call to ypur attention some of our services which are available. We have many rural people as patrons of our library. They have written us for material about our pamph - lets, and for leisure time reading. We have loaned many books to rural schools. You may be glad to know that we have boxed books for schools. We have a collection of magazines and a variety of pamphlet materials that are available to you, some of which are arranged on the screen. If any of you want them, we will be glad to have you call at the Commission. Our library is In the State Capitol Building, Room 1508. Miss Runnalls: I am happy to present Miss Jessie Greene who will tell you about the 4-H exhibits. Miss Green: ' • &#132;' We are happy to show you our 4-H exhibits which only yester - day returned from the National Exhibition in Chicago. We are always proud of the girls, 13,000 in number, enrolled in 4-H Club Work in the state. Each year we see many in this group who have helped the 4-H girls to reach their goal. Perhaps </seg>

She is a home economics student here in College and was on the 4-H judging team that placed first in the 4-H Nation - al Congress, in Chicago. We are very proud of her. Our other teams, (demonstration and judging) placed fourth, sixth and seventh. We invite you to examine our 4-H exhibits. Miss Runnalls: ! Miss Doremus has been working on the health exhibit. Miss Doremus introduced Miss Simonsen. j Miss Simonsen: The health exhibit is at the back of the room and contains chirts and booklets that are available by writing to the State Health de - partment. The chart accompanying the exhibit has a key which ex - plains what is shown. It explains the maternal death rate in this part of the country. You will be interested in knowing where Ne - braska stands. We are doing a great deal to lower the maternal death rate in Nebraska. The most specific thing that has been done recently is the distribution of incubators such as the one shown on the back table. They were distributed in every county of the state on August Ist and to date have been instrumental in saving the lives of eleven infants. I am sure you will be interested in reading the information on the incubator. i You will be interested to know that we .have four general dem - onstration units. The personnel consists of a doctor and a nurse in each unit. Some units control three counties and some four. 'I We also have demonstration units for maternal health and Infant health due to the fact that they have the highest death rate in the state. </seg>
         <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 303 Miss Runnalls introduced Miss Ruby Loper who was responsible for the lighting and the electrical equipment exhibits. Miss Loper: ¦ The lighting exhibits are over in the corner of the room. We will be glad to have you look at them at your leisure. We will be glad to answer any questions you have during the week. Miss Ruth Menoher of the lowa-Nebraska Light &amp; Power Company, will speak later today. I have had the pleasure of listening to her a number of times so I know you will be Interested in knowing what she has to say. Miss Runnalls introduced Mr. Baragar who had charge of pres - sure cooker gauge exhibit. Mr. Baragar: ¦" ¦' Those of you who use pressure cookers for canning, the pres - sure gauge is the important part of the/cooker. The safety valve and petcock should be kept clean so that they do not leak. Ap - pearance does not always tell the condition of the gauge. In the exhibit are shown two guages. One looks good but reads 3 pounds high at 15, one looks good but reads 3 pounds low at 15, and another looks bad but is all right. Some poor gauges are also in this ex - hibit and it is apparent that they need testing. If you want your gauge tested, send it in to us and we will test it free. All we ask is that you pay the postage. It is important that your gauge be accurate for your canning when you start next season. Miss Runnalls introduced Miss Rocke who had prepared the clothing exhibit. ! ¦- ¦.'¦ .¦¦¦¦¦ ¦ ¦•""¦¦¦•¦'¦•.' ¦'"¦.' ' v ¦ Miss Rocke: , V First of all we have an exhibit of hosiery. An explanation on each chart indicates service you can expect from each type of hosiery. There are also instructions for wise buying of hosiery . We also have a chart on rayon showing process of manufacture and samples of the material; also one on rayon material which very closely resembles wool. There are sample dresses made up of wool with charts showing steps in the manufacture of wool material. Then on the other table you will find men's work clothing which I think you will be interested in looking over. There are leaflets in regard to wise buying of clothing and sizes available. Please help yourself to them. ¦¦' ] </seg>
         <seg id="p306">KKI'OUT OF NKBUASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 304 Miss Runnalls: The exhibits are for you to enjoy and if you have any questions, the committee will be glad to answer them for you. I i Miss Pedde: I think this is the first time I have seen people enjoying :he exhibits so early in the morning. I have been sitting here and .have been wondering how many of you have been students or have sons or daughters here at the College. We thought you would be inter - ested to know what we are doing to provide materially to the heajlth of the boys and girls by the way of the right kind of food. jfVe have almost one thousand boys and girls on this campus now, but we cannot begin to take care of all of them because of the lack of facilities. We thought you would like to meet the one who takes care of all the food for these students. Miss Lusby teaches the course in Institutional Management and also has charge of the cafeteria where these boys and girls get their meais. I am happy to present Miss Ruth Lusby. who will speak on the "Relation) of Food to Life". j THK RELATION OF FOOD TO WFE Miss Lusby. j The relationships of food to life are so many and so varied that they have formed the bases for discussion in many volumes; In this brief talk it is possible to indicate only a few o£ them. i One might discuss food in relation to the means of life and the many economic and social problems which arise as a result of its production and distribution. ! One might discuss food in relation to healthful living and cite the scientific knowledge which man has gained as to the influence of foods in maintaining health and preventing disease. One might, again, discuss food in its relation to the cost, of living; the part it should take of the family budget; the methods of purchasing it economically. Or one might choose to discuss food, as I have done, in relation to pleasure in living. This is a less weighty subject than the others mentioned but important in its ef - fect on every-day living.

         <seg id="p308">UKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 306 which she consistently refused at home, is a case In point. No one in the Nursery School knew of her dislike and the social code of "we eat everything at Nursery School" won where her mother had failed. A college girl who calls down the length of a dining hall table to the hostess, "Please don't put any carrots on my plate, I don't eat carrots," has created a dramatic moment. She needs to have learned that the pleasure of the other diners will be greater if she leaves the carrots on her plate undisturbed by conversational garnishing. The parent who encourages a member of the family to indulge in food fads and fancies contributes to the woe instead of the weal of person and family. Modern man is so constituted that he loves to diet and if he must, spectacularly. He usually also loves to talk about his diet—and if he does, dramatically. An unusual combination of foods or a startling omission may give conversational flavor which more than offsets its gastronomic limitations to the dieter. Unfortunately he seldom realizes how boring the description of his diet or his fad is to his listeners. The clanger of food fads is, of course, that they seldom are scientifically sound and may lead to nutritional deficiencies or digestive upsets. The dietitian tries to make special diets conform as nearly as pos - sible to the normal dietary; the food faddist tries to make the fad as different from normal as his imagination and ingenuity can con - ceive. Rebecca McCann has written in "The Cheerful Cherub" this verse: When work seems rather dull to me And life is not so sweet One thing at least can bring me joy I simply love to eat. She may be referring to the pleasure that cornea through eating in Kood company. The code of our desert forebears required the breaking of bread and sharing of salt (scarce and therefore treasured) with any stranger who might come to the encampment. The gesture was one of peace. This custom has influenced our modern hospitality. Nowadays we put the kettle on when a guest drops in to call, not because he is necessarily hungry and needs food, but as a means of honoring him. The best we have is none too good for the guest. The hostess should remember, however, that it is the spirit of hospitality and the act of graciousness which are more enjoyed and longer remember - ed than the dish served. Bread, butter and tea served without apology </seg>

         <seg id="p310">RKI'dKT (IF XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 308 known for some time and have enjoyed over the years. Miss Atwood was formerly nutrition specialist in the Extension Service. She is now Associate State Director of the Farm Security Administration. She is going to tell you about the Farm Security program in Nebraska. I know you will be interested in hearing about the program as it is carried out in all counties of Nebraska. FARM SECURITY PROGRAM IN NEBRASKA Miss Atwood: In presenting the Farm Security Administration program to you, I shall preface my remarks with a brief history of the incep - tion of the program. In 1934 one of the divisions of the Federal Emergency Administration was rural rehabilitation which was merely to render financial assistance to farm families on relief. July 1935 the Rehabilitation Division was divorced from the Federal Emer - gency Relief Administration and became known as the Resettlement Administration, which in turn officially died September 1937 and became a division of the Department of Agriculture and known as the Farm Security Administration. At this time the program lost many of its emergency features and became a long-time construc - tive program with its objective the rehabilitation of distressed farm families —farm families who have gone as far as they can on their own, farm families who cannot obtain any commercial credit. The Farm Security Administration has two major activities; namely, Rural Rehabilitation and Farm Tenant Purchase. The objective of each division is what I have just said; that is, the re - habilitation of distressed farm families. However, in discussing this program with you I shall devote most of my time to the Rehabilita - tion Program since this is the major activity of the Farm Security Administration. At the present time here in Nebraska the Rural Rehabilitation of the Farm Security Administration is assisting approximately„ 12, 000 farm families who are attempting to become rehabilitated, or in other words, are working toward a farm enterprise which will (a) Provide and maintain from their own resources an ac - ceptable standard of. living (b) Pay for operating expenses (cl Provide for the retirement of the borrower's debt struc - ture in an orderly way within a 5 year period. The question which, no doubt, comes to your mind is, "How does a family receive such assistance?" When a family has gone as far </seg>
         <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 309 as they can on their own, cannot obtain credit from any other source and really have a desire to be self-supporting they come to the local county office of the Farm Security Administration and make application for rehabilitation. The Rural Rehabilitation Supervisor and the farmer analyze his situation, go over his past farming oper - tions, discuss the type of a farm he operates, what kind of rental arrangements or mortgages he has, the equipment he is using how much live stock, he raises, what crops he is growing, the number of acres in each crop, whether the family is in good health how large a garden they have, amount of help that is given by the family as a whole, etc. Such an analysis brings put why the family have not been able to meet their obligations. The application is presented to^a local committee made up of public spirited citizens of the county who consider this family from the standpoint of their past exper - ience as a farm family, their managerial ability, their honesty, the relationship, within the family, and the attitude of the community toward this family. If the family is approved by the committee a Farm and Home Plan is developed with the family with the assistance or the Farm and Home Supervisor. , What is a Farm and Home Plan? It can be briefly answered Dy saying that it is a chart of proposed activities for both farm and home which the family intend to carry out during the coming year Special emphasis fs placed on activities in which the family have fallen short. The plan outlines their future operations on a well - balanced basis, which will insure sufficient income to meet the family living expenses, operating expenses, and repay their present con - tracted debts. Much stress is placed on the families following prac - tices which will assure them that their necessary cash living expenses will come from live stock products rather than depending on cash crops. To accomplish this each borrower Is enouraged to plant sufficient acreage to feed crops, particularly drouth resistant sor - ghums, and to build up an adequate feed reserve. The Nebraska staff of the Farm Security Administration feel that farm families who cannot continue on their, own responsibility and are dependent on government assistance can only be rehabilitated and repay their loans by the building up of adequate feed reserves and adequate live stock subsistence units. It cannot be done by dependence on cash crops. The development of a Home Management Plan along with a Farm Plan enables the homemaker to recognize and assume her responsibility in the family's rehabilitation plan. It helps her to determine what adjustments can be made in her home management practices in order to insure more adequate living standards on the income that will be available. In developing a plan the family first figure just what are their essential needs for food, clothing, fuel, household supplies and equip- </seg>
         <seg id="p312">KKI'oRV OF XKBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 310 ment, personal expenditures, education, church and medical care. Then they decide how many of these essentials can be produced on the farm as fuel, making garments, the amount of garden needed to make possible the preservation of most of the food needed, the num - ber of hogs for butchering, the number of eggs, how much actual cash will be needed to purchase the remaining essentials which can - not come from the farm. Since the family living is to come from the sale of live stock products the family then figure how. many dozen i eggs and pounds of butterfat must be sold to cover the cash living \ expenses. For example; suppose the family living comes to $410.00 and that they will sell about $110.00 worth of eggs during the year, then there still is $300.00 to be covered by the sale of butterfat. Let us say that the average price of butterfat is 25(? or A lb. to each dollar (300x4 = 1200) or that this family must have 1200 lb. of butterfai available for sale in addition to 350 lb. for home use. That means that the farm must produce 1550 lb. of butterfat. In Nebraska the average number of pounds of butterfat per cow is 160 lb. but for simple figuring let us say that this family's cows aver- j age 150 lb. per year, which means that this family must milk ap - proximately 10 to 12 cows. If this family must have from 10 to 12 milch cows than they must next consider pasture, both temporary and permanent, and other feed that will be needed for them. This means that the next step in developing this family's plan is to de - velop a croping system which will make it possible to maintain 10 to 12 cows in addition to horses and hogs that will also require feed. The Farm Plan also sets forth the crops that are to be planted, the total income that may be expected under normal conditions from the entire enterprise. Expenses involved in operating the farm for the coming year are also anticipated. From this anticipated income is deducted the estimated cash needed for family living and for op - erating the farm. The remaining figure represents the amount that will be possible to be paid this coming year toward retiring his con - tracted debts. Briefly there is nothing new or magic planned—the goal is just a sound well-rounded year's farming, which under normal conditions will insure a living for the family. Writing a Farm and Home Plan may have sounded rather technical to you when I first mentioned it but it is simple. We feel that a family takes a long stride ahead when they make plans twelve months in advance. Planning for a limited income distributed over a year that will meet actual needs is helping these families not only to get on their feet but how to meet their obligations. Such planning usually brings to light that the family needs some seed, another team, equipment, subsistence live stock, and a </seg>
         <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 311 pressure cooker before it will be possible to carry out this plan on a sound operating basis. In such cases loans are made. These loans are really character loans since the families have exhausted all their sources of credit. Many of the families have poor credit rat - ings only because in the past they haven't been able to pay, but these government loans make it possible ior these families to get set-up on a sound operating basis and will be able to pay. These loans are repayable over a period of 1 to 5 years and carry a 5% interest rate. a family is overburdened with debts, the Farm Security Ad - ministration tries to help the family get their debts straightened out. It is obvious that unless there is reasonable assurance that the borrowers debt structure can be set within his ability to repay, there s no possibility of rehabilitation and no basis for making another loan. Each county has an organized volunteer committee of local citizens appointed by the Governor, who with the field staff of the Farm Security Administration helps to get the farmer and his cred - itors to sit down together and plan these debts on a basis which they can afford to pay. They generally work out a reduction of debts, or longer terms on reduced interest rates on a basis that is mutually satisfactory. During the past three years as a result of work done through these committees, a debt reduction of $4,223,666.00 has been accomplished. During the past three years approximately 12,000 Nebraska farm families have been made loans through the Farm Security Admin - istration. Very few, if any, of these farm families would be on farms today had it not been for this assistance. We feel confident that eventually these borrowers will get back on their feet and able to carry on without assistance from the Government. Such a program, known as the rehabilitation loan program, is cheaper than direct relief and besides It is doing the families more good because a family that Is willing to work hard and live thriftily should be able to attain security. Rehabilitation of farm families is a community responsibility. The Farm Security Administration is merely to assist with this. I hope that you as a representative of your community will be willing to give assistance to these families as the occasions arise. ¦ - Another part of the Farm Security Administration program is the Farm Tenant Purchase program which is for the purpose of helping farmers to security in ownership by purchasing farms under the Bankhead Jones Farm Tenant Act. Last year approximately $200,000.00 was allotted to Nebraska for this purpose. With this money loans were made for the purchase of 24 farms in five different counties; namely, Cedar, Dawsbn, Gage, Polk and Morrill. This year nearly one-half million dollars have been allotted to Nebraska </seg>
         <seg id="p314">IlKlMikT ()K NEBRASKA STATK BOARD UP AGRICULTURE for this program and more loans will be made in these same five counties with Burt, Chase, Harlan and Greeley counties being added to the list. The selection of applicants and farms under this pro - gram is made by a committee of three farmers appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture in each count}'. Loans are made on a forty year basis at 3% interest. The two phases of the Farm Security Administration program which I have just discussed; namely, Rural Rehabilitation and Farm Tenant I'urchase have as their objective the rehabilitation of farm families. The Farm Security Administration has also been given the re - sponsibility of administering the grant prqgram, which is direct re - lief to farm families to tide them over until they can get another crop. This program has been necessary to meet the distressed con - ditions which have existed for the past several years. They are for the purpose of meeting temporary needs only and to provide needy families with only indispensable medical aid, and emergency sub - sistence needs as food, clothing, and shelter. The fact that it has been necessary to spend more than five million dollars on this type of assistance in Nebraska during the past three years is in itself indicative of what has happened to agriculture during these drouth years. This program which I have just been discussing is carried out in all 93 counties of Nebraska through 65 County Farm Security Administration offices. County Supervisors are in charge of these offices. We have twenty-eight home supervisors assisting these county supervisors to rehabilitate 12,000 families. The home supervisor has the responsibility of assisting the families develop their Home Plans, of supervising the families, and in keeping their records in their Farm Family Record Books. Each borrower is required to keep a record book as a means of increasing their income and controlling their expenses. It is felt that by keep - ing an accurate account book of the year's operations, the family will be in a much better position to plan their future Hying and operations and is necessary for the rehabilitation of a family who is dependent upon the Government for assistance. To briefly summarize, the Farm Security Program aims to make these families who cannot continue on their own responsibility be - come self-supporting. It is a supervised loan program based on sound farm and home management plans and helpful supervision. It is not in any sense another lending agency duplicating or taking the place of another established credit agency. Families who; can obtain the necessary financing to continue on their own responsi- </seg>
         <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION bility are not eligible for assistance from the Farm Security Ad - ministration. Bankers and other business concerns have evidenced such an interest in this form of supervised credit that we firmly believe that supervised credit will continue in some form or another regardless of whether administered by a governmental agency or by the development of private agencies to deal with this type of credit tor farm families. ¦ i lam sorry we do not have time for questions as I know you are full of them. We will remember what Miss Brown just said In jher announcement, let the people who are going on the bus go out Xllot*' ...-¦-. WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 7, 1938 MRS. ALVIN GARD, Presiding Vlrs. Gard: We had such a splendid program this morning. I imagine you ¦al, f^ ] f^ old saying that goes something atter 12 ashion, "Well begun is half done." For our first speaker on the Drogram this afternoon we have Miss Edith Carse who is the head of the Housing and Equipment Division in the Home Economics De - partment here at the College of Agriculture. With this talk I feel the program is well begun. I Miss Carse has been in England the past year where she has been studying the housing situation. I know we are going to «n d '^S^^^?*? Eng»Sh fusing Itu^n" A NEBRASKA STUDENT LOOKS AT THE ENGLISH HOUSING SITUATION. Miss Carse: Like most of the European countries/England has for many years bsen concerned about the housing of her working class people^ He ?n ranV lmprovlng houslng conditions is based upon the belief ha environment is an important factor in human development and that in order to safeguard the England of the future healthful liv - ing conditions must be provided for all, regardless of their incomes. . It was in 1919, just after the war that the need for new houses became so urgent that the government was forced to take action </seg>
         <seg id="p316">KKI'oKT OF NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 314 which resulted in the building of "houses for heroes". Ever since that time there has been constant governmental assistance available for the building of more working class dwellings. In 1930, however, an act was passed in Parliament placing the responsibility for slum clearance and rehousing upon the various local governments, whether urban or rural. Financial help was, of course, provided in the form of a subsidy. All areas were surveyed, substandard dwellings were condemned and a new program for the building of new dwellings was begun. When the slum clearance was well underway the Housing Act of 1.935 was passed which made overcrowding of dwellings illegal and placed the responsibility for its abatement again upon the local governments. More surveys were made, each dwelling was .measured and allotted a permitted number or persons who would be allowed to live in the house, counting children from one to ten years of age as one-half person. To accomodate the overcrowded families the building of large houses, having as many as six bedrooms, was begun and has been foing steadily forward. Overcrowding is now considered a legal offense on the part both of the landlord and tenant if the tenant lias refused adequate, suitable dwellings elsewhere. The new houses being built, as a part of the present housing program then, are (1) for slum clearance, chiefly two and three bed - room houses, (2) for overcrowded families, with four to six bed - rooms, (3) for old age pensioners, usually three room bungalows and i 4) a few parlour type houses, built to relieve the housing short - age among people who can pay an economic rent. All are attrac - tive red brick, semi-detached houses similar in general style, ex - cept as size make variations necessary. The town I shall use as an example is Rotherham, a mining and steel town about the size of Lincoln, located in Yorkshire, in the North of England. I spent almost six months in the housing office there, working with the managers .responsible for the administration problems of about 4500 municipal houses, with about 600 more under construction. A weekly visit was made to each of the houses by one of the housing staff. The more expensive houses were managed by men, while all of the slum clearance houses and part of the parlour type houses were managed by women trained for the work. Some tenants needed no attention at all beyond the collection of rent and the reporting of repairs needed. Others were constantly getting them - selves into trouble and needed guidance which could only be given by someone who knew them well. A few never made a satisfactory </seg>
         <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 315 adjustment in the new house and were frequently being reminded to clean up the house, take the children to the clinic, or do less quarrelling with their neighbors. As soon as new houses were ready for occupancy we arranged for the new tenants to move in. These new tenants had been visited in their former homes, usually damp, dark, dilapidated slum dwellings which had been condemned several years ago. Their needs were Known to the housing managers and they had expressed their pre - ference as to the location of their new.home. In most cases they were very eager to make the change, kost of the old houses had been infested with vermin so on moving'day, as a matter of routine all belongings were sealed in a moving van and fumigated so that each family could have a clean start in the new house. The^first few days in the new houses were very important and all possible help was given to each family to help them to improve ,their standards of living. In one town which I visited, Chesterfield each slum family was required to live in a special cottage for sev - eral days before going into the new house. These cottages were simply but attractively furnished and considerable supervision was provided in an effort to help families develop a liking for a clean ¦md orderly house with decent beds and furnishings. Every family in England has an income and therefore can pay rent regularly. Those who are unemployed get insurance each week, those who are on the dole collect it regularly and the old age pen - sioners also reeive their allowance. Rents are adjusted to income In many instances, otherwise those on small incomes could not have been rehoused. To make a fair adjustment of rents it was neces - sary to know much about the family, including the total income and ages of children. In extreme cases a family might occupy a new house with perhaps five bedrooms for the equivalent of $1.75 a week while the father and sons were unemployed and pay as much as $4.50 for it when the income became normal again. All rents are low because of the subsidy and because of the simple design of the houses. Working class families were delighted with these simple houses because they were spacious, had plenty of yindows and could be kept clean in contrast to the old ones with cracked plaster, broken woodwork, damp walls and gloomy atmos - phere. Many of the new houses had no plumbing upstairs, the bath - room being located next to the kitchen. There were no basements the rooms on the first floor being heated by the fireplace in the room, often called the kitchen, which was used for living and dining as well, while gas panel heaters installed in the walls might provide heat in one or more bedrooms. In the houses in which I lived there was ho heat upstairs at all. Very few closets or cupboards were </seg>
         <seg id="p318">RKrnRT ()K XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE provided because of the expense but tenants did not miss them be - cause they had never had them. I was particularly interested in the effect of good housing on family welfare. It was with much pleasure and anticipation that I moved some families with whom I had become well acquainted into neA- houses and watched the different members respond. Some of them had saved for months or years to buy new furnishings and start afresh in a new house. Their new home becomes a source of pride and a constant pleasure. Especially the children were bene - fitted noticeably by the change. In some instances community or - ganization is associated with the new housing estates. It is rec - ognized that families have been uprotted and that they may be un - happy and badly adjusted in the new group if someone does not help them to participate in community life. This is particularly true in the larger cities where instead of houses with gardens only a flat is provided for each family. Juvenile delinquency has been a dif - ficult problem in these new housing developments where no effort has been made to provide normal leisure time activities for the young people. Two results of the rehousing program were particularly inter - esting to me: The first was the rise in standard of living which is going on. Working class families are eagerly taking advantage of the opportunities for better living made possible by residence in good houses. The second was the stimulation of the private build - ing industry. As the working class, underprivileged families have been provided with good houses, flower and vegetable gardens, middle class families have attempted to provide themselves also with an environment which provides more freedom than could be had from the old style row houses which are common even in small villages. Many are even attempting home ownership in an effort to have better living conditions. Mrs. Gard: I am sure, Miss Carse, we have all enjoyed our trip to England through your eyes. Miss Carse will answer any questions you may have to ask. At this time I wish to appoint the following committees. Last year we were asked to get a committee who would sit through this year's program and plan for next year's. The following people were chosen to serve on these committees: </seg>

In considering the objectives of the National Youth Adminis - tration one thinks immediately of the situation or circumstances which brought about the need for such a program. One then recalls the plight of our youth during the past years. Those young people .who are within the age group, 18 to. 25 years, have spent their life in a world of social and economic instability. The years of the Great </seg>
         <seg id="p320">UKI'oKV OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE War with the industrial boom following, then 1929 and the sub - sequent depression—not normal years as we judge normally—surely not years for youth to grow easily into adult-hood. This has been the situation in our own country while much of the rest of the world was suffering war, revolution, the breakdown of age-old gov - ernments, and the establishment of a variety of different ones. All of this has been in the world while our youth have been growing up. They have had a definite part in the restlessness and insecurity which youth today are feeling. We have only to remember these things when the problems of youth are brought to our attention. Through all, 1 [eel our youth today have a social consciousness and a dif - ferent attitude born of the hardship and stress of these times than the youth of yesterday had with its sense of security of those times. Dissatisfaction which youth feel today is not unreasonable. Their demands are the normal demands of young people the world over. They ask an opportunity to attain an education, to earn their own living, to marry and to establish their own family. They want also to understand our government, and to take their place as citizens of this, their country. Their restlessness comes because of our lack of ability to fill these normal demands. There have not been enough jobs to ko around. There has been the devastating gap—often of years—between school and a job and the lack of training and ex - perience to fit and fill most of the jobs that eventually come. It was because these demands could not be met that the National Youth Administration came into being. Through executive order of the President in June, 1935, the NYA was created in an attempt to at least partially solve these problems and fill at least part of the needs of our youth. To fill them, not through a regimentation, but through the reinforcement and stabilization of the family as a unit. The National Youth Administration was brought into being to do something for the nation's unemployed youth for, as was said at that time, "We can ill-afford to lose the skill and energy of these young men and women. They must have their chance in school, their turn as apprentices, an opportunity for jobs, a chance to work and earn for themselves." And that is in fact what the National Youth Administration has been endeavoring to do. Work is provided for students in need of the opportunity to earn in order to attend school. Part-time employment is provided for youth out of school, who are not married and from families certified as in need of assistance. Assistance is also given youth through guidance and placement services. In addition to the hours of project work, for which the youth is paid, the National Youth Administration attempts to give occupational information and other related training in hours for which he is not paid. These are the objectives of our program. They furnish a broad program of activity </seg>

All projects in the schools on which youth work are plan - ned and supervised by the schools. The schools and colleges main - tain and operate the Student Aid program. General rules and *en - eral supervision and the paying for the work done is NYA's part in this program, . . In March, 1938 In the United States there was a total of 327 484 students assisted in high schools and There were dur - nd that month 23,900 high schools participating in the program 1,^36 colleges and with 152 colleges participating in the graduate </seg>
         <seg id="p322">KKI'oRT OF XKBKASICA STATIC BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 320 aid program. In Nebraska, during that same month, March, 1938, 2,742 high school youth earned amounts varying from'sl.oo to $6.00 in 538 high schools. 1,601 college students earned an average ol between $11.00 and $12.00 in the 23 colleges of the state. In two of the colleges 12 students participated in the college aid program. This makes a total of 4,346 students in Nebraska who had part-time employment through the NYA program to assist them in attending school during March, 1938. The average was much the same during other months last school year. The number assisted is somewhat increased this year. The projects on which these youth work are large excellent ones which add to the wealth of the school and give the youtli valuable vocational and practical work experience. In order that youth participate in the School Aid program they do not have to be from families certified as in need, though their selection is made by the school officials on the basis of need. In turning our attention to the consideration of the second ob - jective, we find this is not true in the operation of the work pro - ject program for out of school youth. Youth for this work must be between 18 and 25 years of age, not married, not in school, and from families receiving some kind of public assistance. These youth are certified and then become available to us for assignment to work projects which are selected because of their training value to the youth himself and the value of the project to the community. On these projects, not only are good work habits insisted upon- and tood work made a necessity, but additional .hours are expected to be spent by the youth in gaining further exploratory experience and related training. In March, 1938, there were in the United States 155.000 youth on these part-time work projects. In Nebraska there were 185 3—this number has increased in Nebraska to 2500. The projects on which our youth work are greatly varied. For instance in Lincoln at Antelope Park the project includes, at the present time, the development of a forty-acre tract formerly a nine - hole ,-jolf course. This affords part-time employment under skilled supervision to nearly 100 boys. They gain experience in landscape work, road making, carpentry, cement work, masonry and other phases of building. On this tract the boys have already built a large rustic shelter which we are using for our wood-working shop and a park care-taker's house. Another rustic shelter is under con - si ruction and another one will be constructed soon. We have built several bridges, placed about 10,000 of the ultimate 14,000 trees and shrubs, built roads and parking areas. Plans have been made to include two lagoons in this area. Work has begun on them. In addition to this park development boys in Lincoln have built five other rustic shelters in other parks as well as one stone shelter, large feeding racks for animals at Pioneer Park and have done a con- </seg>
         <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 321 iiiderable amount of park beautification. All of this building has )een done with timbers processed from trees which died as a result of- the drought. Lincoln boys are also employed in assisting at the pity Park Department Nursery, doing safety patrol duty for school children at busy crossings, and working at the wood-working shop furniture for our resident-training projects is being made and n-here desks and other furniture have been made for the Gity Park Department and other Agencies. The NYA projects which employ out-of-school youth is even more varied throughout the state than the project program of Lin - coln indicates. Braille books for the Nebraska School for the Blind -i re made in Omaha, an adobe-brick community building at Bayard, £ number of youth cabins, park gateways, wading pools, recreation areas, tool and equipment houses, are numbered among other con - struction jobs which have been accomplished as NYA work projects. Girls in Lincoln are employed on a sewing project with the Red Cross Emergency Shop as sponsor where garments are made f3r relief families, on clerical projects with public agencies, and in making exhibits arid demonstrations for use in instructional work. An interesting development in recent months in the NYA program is that of Resident Training Projects on which project work is accom - plished for which youth are paid a sufficient amount to have between ?5.00 and ?10.00 when they return home after two weeks at the residence. Each pays her share of the costs of the cooperative liv - ing expenses. There are five such projects for girls in operation id Nebraska. More than one hundred girls are assigned to them: IJnder the supervision of home economists, our girls learn in an in - formal, though efficient manner, the fundamentals of homemaking. This instruction is given in the hours for which the youth is not pi lid by the government. • ' ¦¦- . ¦¦••'¦¦¦¦¦....¦¦. ."¦ •''-¦-¦•¦ ¦ ' ¦ ! A large resident project.for boys is being planned. This will' employ more than 100 boyswho will be given a sufficient number of hours of work to earn $10.00 a month above their cooperative! living expenses. In hours for which they will not be paid they will bj given exploratory experience in at least three occupations dur - iijg their 6 months residence. Such things as auto mechanics, sheet m^etal work, weldingy steam fitting, wood-working are among the more than 15 occupations for which such exploratory work exper - ience will be given. In Nebraska the last named objective, that of guidance and placement, is being carried on by the NYA to a greater extent in Omaha and Lincoln than in other communities. In the office ot the State Employment Service in Omaha there are two counselors oil the payroll of NYA whose entire time is devoted to youth. There </seg>
         <seg id="p324">liKl'i'|(T OF .VKBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is also a receptionist and a project supervisor. This makes up the Junior Placement Division of that office in Omaha. In Lincoln there is one such counselor. To sum up our objectives, I would say we are attempting in every way that we can to assist needy students and out-of-school youth who are eligible to our program to live a more abundant life in these very strained times of world history. Mrs. Card: Thank you. Miss Shamp, I am sure we have a better view on the National Youth Administration Objectives. Project club women will all agree that music is one of the worth while things of life. There are rural choruses in quite a number of the counties of our state now. The rural chorus of Hamilton County have come to sing for us this afternoon. Mrs. Fred Stevens is their director. May I now introduce Mrs Stevens and the Hamilton County Chorus? They will sing three numbers, "Sweet &amp; Low", "Keep on Hopin'", and The Lord is my Shepherd." .Mrs. Gard: We wish to express our appreciation to this fine chorus. Would Miss Sa.vton come to the stage and choose a song to sing while the stage is being made ready for the next part of the program ? Miss Saxton: There is no song we can all sing as well as "My Nebraska." Mrs. Gard: Our program would be incomplete without our annual recog - nition service for County Chairmen which is in charge of a person well known to all of us. Home Demonstration work and her name are synonymous. I am sure you know I am speaking of our State Home Demonstration Leader, Miss Mary-Ellen Brown. COUNTY CHAIRMEN RECOGNITION SERVICE Miss Mary-Ellen Brown We have now come to the part of the Organized Agriculture program when we take time to recognize the fine work which has been and still is being done by the county chairmen of the home demonstration project club work in the counties of Nebraska.

In that year when we received ou,r little gold pins, I remember hW much inspirational talks given here by our state leaders and others, impressed me with the responsibility resting on us as leaders or women s extension work In our counties. It means work, yes, but what greater isatisfaction and pleasure can one get from life than that which comet, from service to others' We meet and learn to know so many lovely women, whose friend - ships last through the years. I like to think of the Home Demonstration Leadership Pin as an emblem^f quality. We talk much of equality, but let us drop the E and think of the quality that lies within you, the certain qual - ityj that causes your club members to choose you as their chairman Yo lU can well be proud to belong to this group, because it means that the women wearing the pin have a standing in their community </seg>

I bring you greetings from the 1933 Chairmen. .Miss Brown: The representative of the 1934 group is Mrs. R. A. Kuehn of Cass County. Mrs. Kuehn: County chairmen of 1939: I bring you greetings from the sroup of 1934. We extend to you a very hearty welcome into the ;;roup of women who wear the little gold leadership pins. You have been chosen County Chairmen of Home Demonstra - tion Clubs by the women of your counties because they have faith in you, so I am sure that it is with a feeling of great satisfaction that you are receiving this special recognition today. With this honor comes responsibilities to the people of your counties. You are held in very high esteem by your women and they are looking to you as an example of an all around person. Sometimes it seems as though we are hardly able to accomplish all the tasks set for us to do, but in'some way we seem to get through with them all. Our ability to keep up with the times gives us a mental satisfaction that more than compensates for the effort it takes to accomplish this. Our successes, satisfaction and self asurance come from a know - ledge of difficult tasks planned, attempted, and successfully com - pleted. Mrs. Raymond Sayre said at the State Council meeting, "The more I work with others, the more I am deeply convinced that before we can have community cooperation, national understanding and international friendship, we must first have homes where co - operation, friendships, and understanding have become the law of life in all family life, it is the Mother who is the interpreter. She can never be just the keeper of the house. She is always the keeper of the spirit of the home." What a challenge that is to you leaders who work with the </seg>

You can do much in this service, thereby adding to your own happiness.

'Vhen your county elected you to this office they recognized you as a leader of outstanding ability, therefore, we know we can be proud to add you to our group. I wish that each one of the 1935 group, there were only 23 of us that year receiving pins, might speak for themselves. lam sure a|iy one of them could do .much better than I. But I think one of the things I learned when County Chairman, was to do the things II was.asked to do. In fact I learned that it was of no use to make excuses, and I still find myself doing the things asked of me eveu though I know someone else could do it better than I. I feel like a pioneer in this Extension work. My home is in Thayer County now, but I lived in Seward County at the time that county had the first lady agent in Nebraska. I was much interested. I (remember hitching- our horse to the buggy and driving into Beaver Crossing to meet Miss Warner, our agent, who came from Seward on the .train to spend the night with me so that she might hold Homemaker Club the next afternoon. Can you imagine a home dem - onstration agent doing that today? I remember how anxious I was to have everybody be members and come to Homemaker's Club. I^even drove that horse and buggy around trying to get people in - terested and I want to say to you chairmen who are from a county Wjhere Extension work is new and just getting started and you are fjill of zeal and enthusiasm in pushing it, don't become discouraged </seg>
         <seg id="p328">lii:ni)(T t)F XEBHASKA STATIC BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 326 for Extension work will speak for itself. Its growth will seem slow, but for that reason more sure. I hope that each of you are the kind of county chairman that the State Extension workers enjoy working with when they come into your county. I hope you are the kind of county chairman who will have time to attend when your County Far.m Bureau holds a meeting, i hope that when your County Agent and Home Demon - stration Agent ask for help, you are the kind of County Chairman that will be there. I hope you are the kind of club members who love your neigh - bor as yourself. Then when your term of office is over and you take your place among this group o f past county chairmen, you will know the satisfaction of work well done, but I hope you are the kind who will still find many things to do. There will be a new County Chairman to encourage. You can still be that faithful standby of your agents, can still be the one that is always there. And now in this Yule-Tide Season of good wishes, what more can I wish for each of you than this —That all your good deeds, all your kindness and friendly acts, all the bread you cast upon the waters may return to you a hundredfold. Miss Brown: The representative of the 1936 group is Mrs. Paul Pascoe of Dodge County. Mrs. Pascoe: Mr. Brokaw, Miss Brown, honored County Chairmen, and friends: Many fine things have happened to me, but speaking to this group of people is one of the nicest. I must say lam a "has been" or a past county chairman. But "past" and "has been" seem such dead words. Some may think that there is work to do just for the present chairmen, but we that have gone before can and are willing to do anything we may be called upon to be of service to the new - comers. We must never close the county chairman record and say "it is finished, my job is done." You are just starting your work, your duties have just begun. A challenge is given to you to carry on, not alone, but with the help of the preceding chairman. You will benefit from her experiences and knowledge of the past and this, combined with your enthusiasm and ideas, will cause Exten - sion work to grow to new heights. Your service so unselfishly given does so much to keep the machinery of our work running smoothly. You have been untir - ing in your efforts and there will be a closer bond binding us to - gether because of these years of service. </seg>

As I think back, after we had gone through some of the dreadful times, and how during those dreadful times we were shown these better ways of Hiving, and the happiness and experiences that were derived, I am Indeed privileged to say I lead my group during the 1937 year. Remember, though the way is hard and the tasks are many, happiness is your reward in the end. If you would be leader, you must be follower. Take the words of the song, "Follow Me." Miss Brown: .. : The; representative of the 1938 group is Mrs. J. G. Jenson of Washington County. Mrs. Jenson: As the representative of the county chairmen for the year 1938 I, too, wish to extend our heartiest greetings and best wishes for your success. Even the weather is extending good will this year. County chairmen and fellow homemakers, in due time you will receive your little gold leadership pin, which 384 other county chair - man are privileged. to wear, and you will find engraved on its sur - face three letters, H. D. C. This "H" symbolizes for you, Home. The "H" also symbolizes for you, as it does for our 4-H boys and girls, Head for clearer </seg>
         <seg id="p330">KKI'OKT OF NKBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thinking, Heart for greater loyalty, Hand for larger service, and Health for better living, the essentials necessary for the mainten - ance of an ideal home. "D" symbolizes Demonstration, which you carry out by using the home practices demonstrated to us by our leaders, both state and local. "C" symbolizes Club, the group of friends and neighbors who by observance of your interest, work and executive ability have chosen you as their county chairman. You are fortunate in being chosen county chairman in 1938, because so much work has been organized and nicely started in the years gone before. Perhaps you feel as we felt when we sat in your place just a year ago and that is, "Is there anything left for us to carry out?" So much work has been started and accomplished by our leaders of preceding years, but this past work is in reality just a challenge to you. When we reached home from Organized Agriculture last De - cember, we obtained a map of our county and dotted in the loca - tion of each club, and we found, to our surprise, our clubs covered the county diagonally from the northeast to southwest, and there were three spaces which were absolutely bare, and two of the three spaces covered more than the regular townships. Since our county has only had our home agent since October, it was our big job to work on the organization of new groups. So I challenged myself to organize at least one group in each of those three blank spaces. To date, we have two of the three spaces with a club in their region, as well as a goodly number of other groups, helping to fill in the diagonal strip. Therefore, we, the 1938 county chairmen, challenge each of you to carry the Extension Club Organizations into the corners now left empty by us! Will you accept that challenge? Of course you will! That is why your club groups have chosen you. The best and the highest compliment it is possible to pay you, the privilege of wearing our little gold leadership pin. Miss Brown: Happiness is added to our lives through the satisfactions that come to us day by day. Those who have spoken have emphasized some of the satisfactions that come to us. Our next speaker has satisfactions which are somewhat different from those who are work - ing in the counties. Many of her satisfactions come through work - ing with the girls whom you send here to the College. She will be </seg>

There is unrest in the world to - day and when we stop to think of the situation and the cause by which it is built up, the job depends on you and me. Make sure of yourself and get in on the fine ideals of citizen - ship which means so much in a Christian nation such as ours. We have been confronted with this bigger job. We have only about one-fourth of the population where 4-H Club work reaches and emphasizes some of the high ideals that are going to make for the future of this country. Then we have that other feeling, influence. The boys and girls have already passed out of the 4-H group and have become young men and women. They must begin to learn to be the leaders of our own nation. There is a tremendous job ahead if we want to see this nation stabilized, not only for the leaders of today, but for the leaders you have been developing at home. We can use them all for this gigantic task that confronts us and I think we all want for fuller appreciation of this leadership. I should like the group to stand as I read this Appreciation of. Leadership to you. If there are others in the audience who should be with this group, would you please stand too? An Appreciation of Leadership Your friends and neighbors have chosen you county chairmen of home demonstration project work. They believe you to possess that ability to serve and that spirit of self sacrifice so necessary for successful leadership. By this choice there devolves upon you that duty of inspiring your fellow workers with a loyalty to service and a desire for achieve - ment of those things in home making and home life that are neces - sary for better agriculture and more complete living on Nebraska farms. Your selection was an honor and privilege, but it also implied duties to perform and obligations to fill. Your regular duties have not prevented you meeting these tasks and we recognize that only busy people are sucessful leaders. By a faithful performance of your duties, you have inspired a confidence in you and a friendship for you that can only be secured by having been a friend to others and by a faithful performance of obligations assumed. One is not worthily a leader who is not doing all in her power to enlighten her community by becoming, in so far </seg>
         <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 331 as humanly possible, an example of right living and service to others. While the work you have done and the goals achieved are highly commendable, you have but entered into this field of leadership so essential to Agriculture's welfare and to National progress. Others may assume in the coming years your tasks ol the present, but leadership accomplishments imply growth of the individual and point the way to broader fields. Do not misunderstand, that leadership in any field tho it may appear to have greater possibilities for ac - complishments, is no more essential than the proper leadership in your own field. ~ I Your community, your county, your state, the nation, are ob - serving the character of your service. They will expect much of you and in this we are sure they will not be disappointed for into the hearts of all humans there has been implanted, and it depends only upon proper cultivation for growth, that desire for leadership so essential to an occupation such as ours and to the welfare of a Christian Nation. Mr. Brokaw: (After presenting each with a copy) It is a pleasure to present this Appreciation of Leadership to every one of you, knowing you to be leaders who will carry on in this large viewpoint that seems to be confronting the nation at this time. Miss Brown: Thank you, Director Brokaw. I am sure these women will think pf you and of what you have said to them today many, many times when they see their leadership charge. i We who work out from: the state office appreciate knowing and working with the county chairmen although we do not see you often. There are those who work more closely with you so may I give them an opportunity to express their appreciation through the president of th' 9 County Home Demonstration Agent Association who is Aiiss Ethel Saxton. Hiss Saxton: " In behalf of the other home demonstration agents and other extension agents, I should like to express our appreciation for the loyal service and leadership you have given us and to the people cf the counties in carrying out our home demonstration program. The office of county chairman, as you are well aware, carries a great many responsibilities. The woman who fills this office must </seg>
         <seg id="p334">I'.KI'nRT OF XKBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 332 be wise, charming, and tactful. She must be wise because many go to her for advice, the home agent asks her about what to do in a certain situation, the club members come to her to get advice on how to settle club difficulties, she must help plan and steer home dem - onstration work successfully in the county. She must be charming because she appeals to all women and makes them feel she is their representative and is looking for their best interests first of all. She must be tactful so that the women of the county will have confi - dence in her and trust her. She must know when to dip into community affairs and when to stay out. Above all, she must be big enough to forget petty slights and to disregard unkind gossip. The office of county chairman also bears great honor. Of all ihe women in your county, you have been chosen to represent them. Because they have had confidence in your ability and integrity, they have selected you. You who wear the gold leadership pin, wear it proudly. It is in the conduct of your office that the honor lies. The reward you receive lies in the pleasure you have in your leadership and in the grateful appreciation of those with -whom you work. We would like to present you with a little token of appreciation. (Gives each member a flower) We hope this flower will show In a small measure the joy we have of working with you. Miss Brown: As we were silting here just now, the Director said there was something he had forgotten to mention, so I will ask him to tell you himself. Mr. Brofcaw: I am just real happy to be privileged to be present this after - noon. I realize I should not have come on account of a bad cold, but when I thought of who was to preside and about the ones who were to be present, I just couldn't refuse. It reminded me of the times Mrs. Gard took home so many ribbons and I became about as chesty over her achievements as anyone might. That was back in 1910, and as 1 look down in the audience and find others I have worked with, it is indeed a great pleasure to see so many who had a lot to dv with some of the beginnings of this great thing. Miss Brown: Early this fall, Miss Gladys Gallup of the Department of Agri - culture. Washington, D. C. was here in Nebraska. An opportunity came so that she was privileged to visit a County Home Demonstra - tion Council meeting in Dawson County. The council was held at the home of Airs. Archie Fivnch. a former county chairman. It was </seg>
         <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATIOX 333 a covered .dish luncheon. There was a fine attendance and good tnngs to eat. These were important, but Miss Gallup's special re - action to the day was that the group worked until after five plan - ning what could be done to help conditions in their county Miss Galup's comment was that those women and the agricultural agent and the home agent never seemed to be thinking, "What can I get out of this work for myself?" It was always, "What can we do to help make life happier and more worth while for others?" Dawson county is not the only county which has women who are thinking about worth while things for others. That is character - istic of all county chairmen who have served. Now will those who have been wearing the leadership pins in the past kindly stand so those in the room may know who you are? Thank you. Another group who are serving Nebraska happily and well are the county home demonstration agents. Will they please stand?, And while they are standing we would like to have the state home demonstration specialists and the 4-H club leaders stand. Thank you. Some of you can remember back to the earlier days of the homemakers' project clubs when the only officers which were mentioned were the two project club leaders, now clubs have pres - idents, secretaries, the two project leaders, a music leader, a read - ing leader, and often a news reporter. Today we would like to have all who are serving as presidents of project clubs this year, stand. Will the project club leaders who are serving this year please stand too? ¦: ... ¦]• Now may all of us stand together and close by singing, "Follow the Gleam." : Ulrs. Gard: (After singing) | Since the Rural Electrification project has actually begun to func - | ion and serve those who heretofore have not had access to electricity, |ye find it necessary to inform ourselves about this "new servant" and its uses. No subject could be more timely just at present than, "Lightening the Load with Electricity." Miss Ruth Menoher. LIGHTENING THE LOAD WITH ELECTRICITY (The general prices and costs referred to are National average figures;) . Jliss Menoher: What is electricity, someone asks? What it is, we know very little about but we do know what it can and will do for us. I£ </seg>
         <seg id="p336">IIKP. &gt;l:T &lt;&gt;!•' NKBItA.HKA STATIC BOARD OF AGRICI'LTL'RE properly conducted by wire from the generating source to our homes, offices, shops and factories and if at the point of delivery we pro - vide proper tools or equipment, this mysterious something known as electricity becomes, at the mere push of a button or turn of a switch, any one of dozens of magic servants. It may become a flood of light, ¦a laundress, an ice man, water boy, kitchen chef or a modern edu - cator, entertainer and news reporter. In fact, some writer lias said i hat the average American home has at its disposal the equivalent of 30 servants in the form of mechanical helpers. We also know that ."k* worth of electric power can do as much mechanical work as a man can do In one eight hour day. These electrical servants have many excellent qualities. They .ire ready and willing to serve their masters day or night, seven days a week, do not ask for time off, do not talk back, cost nothing when not at work, do their work efficiently and work at coolie wages. It has been estimated that the number of steps taken by a woman in doing the household farm work equals and sometimes ex - ceeds that of the men on the farm. This, itself, may seem an aston - ishing statement but it must be remembered that much farm work is often done by motor-driven equipment, tractors, trucks and cars. There are no tractors in the farm house. Experiments made by several colleges have shown that a woman walks from seven to ten miles a day even though she may never leave the house. Of course you have all heard the saying, "Man works from sun to sun, but woman's work is never done." That has seemed quite true but today in over a million American farm homes that saying has been relegated to the discard along with the oil lamps, wash boards, feather dusters, sad irons and cook stoves for electricity has brought health, comfort and convenience into these homes. As soon as electricity is made available in any home, lighting is, of course, the first servant to be acquired. And what a burden rolls off the homemaker's shoulders when she no longer has to clean and fill the smelly, inefficient and dangerous oil lamps every morn - ing. Adequate and proper lighting adds materially to the comfort, health and safety in any home. Next in importance to proper lighting in the home, we would suggest an adequate supply of running water. The human effort required to supply the water for household consumption sometimes reaches startling figures. On a Virginia farm, water was obtained from a spring 65 feet below the level of the house and 271 feet away. A writer in the magazine "Fortune" figures what this actually meant in effort. </seg>

         <seg id="p338">KKI-oRT &lt;'F NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Since the kitchen is a woman's workshop, let us consider what electricity can do for her there. With three meals a day, three hundred sixty-five days a year for her to prepare, she certainly needs a pood stove. Let us compare her present hand-stoked, cob-wood-coal stove from which ashes and soot must be removed and to which blackening must be applied periodically, with an efficient, modern, electric stove with its permanent finish, its insulated oven with tem - perature control to assure good baking results and instantaneous heat for cooking or baking with no more effort than the turn of a switch With such an electric range there is no fuss and no muss in the kitchen, for a whole meal from soup to dessert may be cooked even with the homemaker miles away. This electric appliance elimin - ates the load of pot watching and pot scouring and the preparation of a meal becomes a wonderful adventure. An electric dishwasher may also be installed in the kitchen and the most disagreeable of tasks can be dismissed forever. In a home with two adults and two children more than 6 tons of dirty dishes are washed every year. More than one entire month of eight-hour days is spent over the dishpan. Another advantage of the.dishwasher is from a health angle. No water, hot enough to wash dishes hy - genically clean could be endured by hands, but the high temperature of the water used in the dishwasher sterilizes the tableware thus preventing transmission of sickness and disease from one member of the family to the other. What does it cost to wash dishes elec - trically, you may ask? Less than a penny a day. From the standpoint of actual money saving, there is no ques - tion but that the electric refrigerator is well at the head of the list. Homes without ice boxes formerly used spring houses, wells, cold cellars, swing shelves, and any place a few degrees cooler than the outside temperature. Think of the countless steps that were caused— the spoiled foods, sour milk, melted butter, tainted meats, the labor. Today with electric refrigeration, it is all changed. No matter what the outside temperature may be-how hot or how cold-an electric refrigerator maintains a constant temperature. You even have that under your control, for you may set the control as easy as setting a clock It is entirely automatic and practically silent in its operation and foods are properly and economically preserved in It. Think of possessing such a piece of equipment at a cost of five cents or less a day I have known cases where the refrigerator was actually paid for by the increase in price received for sweet cream over that which had been received for sour cream.

Two cans of milk per month will pay for lighting the home and operating a washer, flatiron, toaster, percolator and radio. A dozen eggs will pay for the electricity to run a refrigerator for a week.

In an electrically equipped home It may be said, "Mother doesn't work here any more; she lives luxuriously without effort. She dis - covered that enlightened living by an electric pattern was good economics. As electricity comes into the home, drudgery and labor fly out the window," In other words, the electrical plan of living provides more leisure time for social life and the educational side </seg>

Then too, an electrified home brings the comforts of the city to the rural areas thus making farm life attractive enough to keep the young people on fawns where they make their greatest contribution to society. In closing 1 would like to leave with you a thought expressed by Uruce Barton who is well-known to women generally by his ar - ticles in women's magazines. "It has been truly said that you can measure the height of any civilization by the plane upon which Its women live. Measured t&gt;y that standard we have made great progress in the United States, but we have not made enough. An electric motor which runs a washing machine or vacuum cleaner works for two or three cents an hour. There are still millions of women doing this work which motors can do; selling their time at coolie wages of three cents an hour, hav - ing to neglect the highest work entrusted to human beings, the work of motherhood. "The time in the life of a child when a mother can exert her influence is terribly brief. 'Give me a child until he is seven years old', a great philosopher said, 'and I care not who has him after wards.' Seven years in which to mold a character; seven short, fleeting years. What a tragedy that a single moment of these years should be wasted in work which an electric machine can do! "The home of the future will lay all of its tiresome routine burdens on the shoulders of electrical machines, freeing mothers for ihelr real work, which is motherhood. The mothers of the future will live to a good old age and keep their youth and good looks to the end." THURSDAY MORMXG, DECEMBER 8, 1»38 MISS MARY-ELLEN BROWN, Presiding Miss Mary-Ellen Brown opened the meeting by saying, "Let us begin on time. If all of you will move toward the front, you will be better able to see the demonstration which is to be given later. There aren't many people who do better than project women. We will now turn this part of the meeting over to Mrs. Tullis." Mrs. Tullis: Now we will sing. Some of you have sung with me for a good many years and have done a good job of it.

You people who were at the Fun Feed last night may get a double dose of this but others may not. I would like to repeat some of the things Mr. Games said last night. I know you will agree that we are not so interested in national winners, but the thing we are interested in is for boys and girls to receive good training in both Home Economics and Agriculture. If Evelyn and the boys will forgive me for what I have to say, we are not so interested in national winners, but that the boys and girls in Nebraska get good training. We took fifty-eight boys and girls to the National Congress ast week and came back with a ribbon for every exhibit and exhib - itor, in all, we came back with seven medals and two watches One of the exhibitors is here with her watch on. I'd like you to meet Miss Evelyn, Findley. We also sent four teams to the National Dairy Show and they placed fifth and sixth in demonstration and second in judging, r . Mrs. Borman, the team's 4-H Club leader, was introduced fol - lowed by the introduction of Miss Noyea, home demonstration agent from Douglas County. The Team: ¦- '/ I We are members of the Gold Medal Calf Club of Nebraska. My name is Wallace Borman, and my team mate 1b Edwin Holling. I have been in 4-H Club work for six years, five years of which has b ( een devoted to dairy work, and one in farm work. Three years ago our club sent a demonstration team to the National Dairy Show. T|hey placed one-half point below the winning team. We have en - joyed all of our 4-H work and are very proud of our animals. * For our demonstration, we have chosen the making of butter - niilk sherbet in an electric refrigerator. Everyone likes frozen des - serts as they are healthful. Our reasons for choosing this sherbet </seg>
         <seg id="p342">KKIoKT (IF XKBKASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are because it is so practical, and so quickly and easily made. Fol - lowing is the recipe: 214 c. buttermilk or sour milk 1 tsp. vanilla \c. sugar M&gt;c. cream, whipped i£c. crushed fruit Pinch of salt We will now measure the milk. We are using sour milk in this demonstration as most families in our locality sell milk and do not have buttermilk on hand. We only add % cup sugar as sugar lowers the freezing point. We have added % cup sugar to the liquid. Next add % cup crushed fruit. We are using pineapple in this demonstration as it goes well with the sour milk. Crushed strawberries or crushed bananas make a pleasing combination also. Vanilla is then added. We think the flavor is improved with a pinch of salt. Thii mixture is now ready to be put in the freezing tray. We have wet the bottom of the tray as this speeds up freezing. While freezing we will avoid opening the door of the refrigerator. We will now put this tray in the refrigerator. For those having no mechanical refrigerator, this sherbet may be frozen with a freezer, ice and salt. Wallace will whip cream and put in our partly frozen mixture. For cream to whip, three things are important. It must be cold, must be rich in butterfat and must be properly aged. If cream is not properly aged, a bit of cream of tartar may be added when the cream is whipped. The cream is now almost ready to be added to our partly frozen mixture. Should this mixture be for - gotten and frozen solid, use mixer and stir Into mush before adding cream. We are now ready to add the cream to the mixture. We chilled the bowl in the ice box before the demonstration so the Mixture would not melt. The length of time for freezing depends on how the tempera - ture for your refrigerator is set. A few hours should be sufficient to freeze the sherbet. The temperature of the freezing unit must be as cold as possible. If the refrigerator has a cold control switch, this should b« set at the coldest point when the sherbet is put in; otherwise it is necessary to maintain as low a temperature as pos - sible within the box. This sherbet was made and put into the refrigerator to freeze beforehand. Sherbet to be good must meet three requirements. It must look good, have fine texture and most important of all, it must taste good. Our sherbet meets these three requirements. We have been using this recipe ever since we have installed an electric re - frigerator and would like to have you to try it. We have mimeo - graphed copies of this recipe which will be passed out. If you have any questions, we will be glad to answer them. Questions and Answers: </seg>

There should be more wjorth while things, particularly those which will help us in our own Philosophy of li^e. some one suggested, when we were thinSg agg this lin^that^we have Dr. Edward Steiner of Grlnnell, Iowa! talk to us. When he was mentioned I thought how wonderful i T; :£l' !? l haVG h6ard Mm&gt;Peak before and know what to expect Sd at this time, I am indeed happy to introduce Dr. Steiner who will talk to us on "Things in Life That Count." </seg>
         <seg id="p344">REI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Dr. Steiner: I am not Car away from home when I come to Nebraska and am not to be regarded as an expert in any line. I worked for one year on a farm in Minnesota as a hired man and was not worth the $15.00 a month the farmer paid me. The cows I milked, I am sure, never enjoyed the process, and the only think 1 achieved that year, and I am proud of it, was cleaning about two acres of scrub oak. The farmer kept me for one year, not because I was such an asset to him, but because I helped prepare his daughter for college. Maude was eighteen and a very pretty girl. Shb liked German poetry and so did I. So in between doing our dally work, we would find time to sit and read. Maude would go out buggy riding with a handsome tall Swede. Had it not been that she was in love with him, I might have been a farmer and a poor one at that. If Maude entered college through my tutoring, then her guardian angel must have seen her through Algebra, as lam sure I did not. Nevertheless, 1 look back upon that one year of working on the farm as the one year of my life I would not give up. For out of that one year grew my enthusiasm and love of America. Today I am not talking as a politician, as I cannot run for office in Nebraska, but as a man acquainted with life. I am not thinking of the seas or lands, but of the Ideals of the democratic way of liv - ing which I saw demonstrated on that quarter section of land in Min - nesota. Now, what are the things that count in life? By that I think we mean the things that give one a thrill or a kick out of life, like the lesson in character and not like the lumps in mashed potatoes. H. W. Deecher was asked, "Was life worth living?", and he answered, that depended on the liver. That has a double meaning, such as, use your liver and the other organs will function, or how you function as a living being. Good health counts, yet there are many humans, who with diseased minds and bodies, have lived purposely, adequate - ly, and we hope creatively, while others with good normal bodies and minds have gone without doing any of these. Mr. Beech'er's subject was, "Why are We Here", and a feeble minded man got up and said, "Because we are not all there." Many of us think if we are far away, we are not all there. Now the thing that counts in life is to function in harmony with this universe. In the New York harbor, during the war time, there were 200 ships built but never sailed. Sad ships that never went to sea, that never functioned and were sold for junk. Many of us die and when they say "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust", some of U3 have just flunked. 1 am thinking back now to more than fifty years to the farm </seg>
         <seg id="p345">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 343 house, and there are many things that impressed me and have re - mained with me to this day. Some of the work done on that farm w^as done without intentions and yet was purposeful. The farmer is not a parasite. Not only does he earn his bread with the sweat of his brow, but he makes it possible tor others to eat their bread with - out sweat of the brow. College professors may do their part to make the world more beautiful and easier to live in, but without the housewife and the husband, there would be no human existence, no civilization. ; . Working on the farm certainly was the most honest way iv wjhich I earned my $15.00. The farmer has to be honest whether he wjants to or not. There are tricks in every trade, but there are no tijicks in farming. If he robs the soil he robs himself. He cannot turn a peacock into a poodle dog. The farmer does work which is essential to the human being. There are many who are incapacitated, and cannot work. There are those who cannot find work. These are tragic things that stop you in your work. The greatest experience in life is life itself. It is full of thrills. One of the greatest sins in the world is the failure to be thrilled by life itself, like the radios, great currents running through this uni - verse, like filling your lungs with fresh air as you come out of a room, or the great enjoyment you get in moving into your own home which you have built, or haying a child born to you. Do your task so well that it couldn't be done any better and you become creative. -.'¦|| lii this brief cross of life, all the realities of our existence, the joy of playing, the glory of action, the splendor of beauty, are but a Jgleam and tomorrow only a vision. But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a day of hope. Look well to this day. Things that count are the things that are continually lifting ub up and up as they echo and re-echo in this vast hall of time, something that is lasting in its effects. With great pride I look up to the farm land which I cleared of scrub oak. With joy I think of my thirty-five years as a professor. Some of you may know I have written books, or someone may have read some of them, for I have written fourteen. Work may be pleasure. The farmer's wife must work without complaint to keep in step with the passing hours of the season. ( The useful work which expresses oneself, is the kind of work that counts. It is in rhythm and harmony with the universe. One. should play, only if they have worked usefully. God rested the seventh day and instituted the sabbath not only for man for rest, but for man servant, maid servant, oxen and ass. This was the first new deal and God continued it. If you study the Good Book you will find more about the new deal. </seg>
         <seg id="p346">UKl'dltT (IF XKBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A few days ago on my way here, I read this address. Miss Nelson suggested the subject and I clung to it as best I could. 1 lectured to a Woman's Club in a new enormous building, the room larger than this. Crowded into this room were ten bridge tables, around each were four women desperately playing bridge. Not a good looking one among them, at least if any of them were good looking I couldn't see it, for they had their faces set with such de - termination to win that useless game that it spoiled their looks completely. In fact, as I came up to the platform they could have murdered me. None of these women had ever been bothered with housekeeping, they were sort of housekeeperettes. Later, after being introduced, one woman asked me if I played bridge. I had to con - fess I knew nothing about the game. "What do you do to kill time?" she asked. I answered, "I never have time to kill. If anything, time will kill me." Another lady asked if I played golf. Again I had to admit I knew a hoe from a spade, but not a driver from a putter. I get my exercises acting as a pall bearer for my friends 'who played golf. I think above all, the right to play has to be earned, and when it is earned it may be recreated. It may be most profit - able in enlarging and enriching our personalities, if it is done for others. The other day I watched a group of farmers and their wives take possession of a home where the husband was ill with a broken arm. The women took charge of the household and cooking, while the men were husking corn. Watching them made me believe it was more joyous than playing golf, for they were working together for the good of someone else. On that farm I saw an American way of living, a glimpse of which I shared. I not only saw physical labor which was purposeful, but mental labor which counted in times of poverty. People living on the farm grow larger than the farm itself. They have circulating libraries where they can get books of proven quality, books that are old, but not out of. fashion. There is poetry from the phenomenal and unbelievingly kind Shakespeare. There is poetry from Emerson, Lowell, and Longfellow. These books were not only on shelves, but in the minds of purposeful people. Mental labor does this thing to enrich lives and all of these beautiful things can become part of us. The mental horizon has been increased in bigger and better ways in large newspapers, which bring you the best things of this modern age. Libraries where we can get mag - azines and good literature are provided to assist travelers and ex - plorers, for with the aid of books, we can all travel. Please remem - ber, many people travel all over the world. They never see anything but uncomfortable hotels ;:nd stores where they pay high prices, and come back just as small as they went away, but the man who reads the book closely, becomes richer than before. Of course, there is the radio. What would the home be without one? </seg>
         <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The best of music, such as was heard a little while ago, can be brought to your fireside, where you are happy without any thoughts. Then too, one can get music that exasperates. By the twist of the button they vanish into silence, by another twist, you cm hear great national situations and decisions. Now what about the mental stimulus of the individual? There should be a mental stimulus if life is to have a meaning at all for it enriches our personality. Anything that merely clutters our minds njars our outlook on life, is not worth while no matter how cheap or expensive it might be. The cheapest things, wisely chosen, are open the finest things as far as money value is concerned. The w,ordly things, are often narrowing and improvishing. It may take patience to enjoy profound things. It is a satisfying task to discover that some great living has bjen done, starting exactly, as you have been thinking. To think deeply is a hard job for some, for I know my boss went to sleep Wjhen I read classical literature. Literature has remained most permanent. Temples and great cities have crumbled, but literature ¦has (remained as a priceless possession to this every day. You can - npt. always understand it or stay awake while reading it, but it is a worth while mental struggle, when the best books are at your dis - posal. These books may not be as thrilling as a detective story, bit if you keep reading them you will find stories there which will go on with you and help enlarge your lives. The most satisfying bjpk which has lead to all other books and which has created the greatest impressions in the world, is the Bible and the best part of it came from the countryside where the men lived who wrote it; the animals of the barn yard, the fig tree, the flowers of the field, oxen, sheep, vineyard and the husbandman gathering harvest. From this book, the Bible, man has comprised the past. The glory of action, the joy of play, the splendor of beauty, if W|e can assimilate each, will become a part of us. When I come to Lincoln, where I have such lovely, friends, the one thing that impresses me is your State Capitol. I have a small room just In sight of the Capitol which is worth ten times the price of the largest and most expensive hotel room. Each morning, when I raise the curtain, without any additional charge, I have a view which is so beautiful I ache at its very splendor. But no matter how clean the mirror, it can be easily smugged by the ugly things of life. I would like to recommend a good book, called "The Yearling." It is the story of a farmer living in the swamps, and is the most popular book of the season. Read it and digest it, and you will, know better what counts in life. What are the thrills that the rich and poor can get but of life? I have seen poor hill folk living under </seg>
         <seg id="p348">RKPORT OF NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE terrible circumstances, worse than any peasants I know in any part of the world. Their homes were built of packing boxes and worse than hog houses on your poorest farms and there were hundreds of them scattered through the hills, yet even here I found things which counted and were worth while. I saw one woman, her horizon limited, who was a saint. She had no radio, no permanent wave, nothing, just a radiant soul. She had never been further away from her wretched hut than down to her trading post, yet when we stepped inside her hut, it was as though she had brought down the peace of heaven. The women with me had traveled all over the world and had reviewed books for the good of the people. When we traveled down the hill, my hostess was silent and, I hope, ashamed. I hope we all have a love of God, the one thing that enriches our personality, that touch of the eternal which inspires us and .makes life worth while. Miss Brown: I know there are some people who do not like panel dlcussions, but I have heard some excellent ones and I know you will enjoy these talks today on, "Choosing the Worth While Things in Life."

There are so many good things which one can use to counteract the coarse things, so why not choose with care the pro - grams our family listens to. Oftentimes children listen to awful stories on the radio which are in many ways harmful to them. What are some things we can do to avoid this? We might keep them busy doing more interesting things.

Has anyone a suggestion as to a way we could save time in hunting for these programs?" ¦You could have a radio digest or radio guide on hand, or you might use the radio guide in your evening paper." "Like the radio, at times the shows have pictures which are not the right type for a child to see. I think we should either see that our child noes to the right shows or again we might write to the theater management and tell them the pictures we like and dislike.' ¦I think we should study family relationships. We should try to place ourselves in the position of the other members of our family, so that we might find what their opinions would be. We must learn that each member of the family has a different personality and we should try to understand each person." "In times like today. I think we should all learn the value of money. We should select things for their value and use, for there is an' inflation in the value of the object. Many times, the person having almost nothing benefits more than the one having everything. The cheapest things wisely chosen, are most always the best." "It is always nice to have friends, but let's not load them down with our troubles, as they, no doubt, have some of their own. It is not only how many real friends do I have for myself, but how many do I befriend." •All things work together for good to those who love God.

For some reason I took him in. While riding along, we talked of things such as 'What do you do?", "Where do you live?", etc. We got to the town of Franklin, where he wanted off, and instead of leaving without finishing our conversation, the boy stayed seated in the car and we went right on talking. He told me he was one of eleven children and his mother was dead. He went on and on and told me his story, but said he could stand it all if only he lived in a home where he had a mother. I realized then that he knew what a mother meant, and also the details of making a happy home. Today we are very happy to have with us a man who will help us all to be better homemakers. I would like to present to you, Dr. Steiner, who will talk to us on "A Satisfying Philosophy of Life." Dr. Steiner: As you know, I am a college professor, sort of by accident be - cause the farm girl was in love with the Swede. Most college pro - fessors, when they want to relax, read detective stories. I never do though, for I never want to commit murder and do not want to be a witness to it. I read children's stories especially poetry. I haunt the five and ten cent stores for children's books of poetry. I found one poem upon which I improved. This is the poem: Isn't it quite wonderful that I am made so neatly, And all my little skin and bones are covered so competely, And wouldn't it be terrible if my skin would be unveiled, And all my little wicked parts would be revealed, Oh, I am so very glad my fastenings are safe, I wish that I had been born with a zipper in my head, I could pull it and look into my head. </seg>
         <seg id="p353">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 351 I I was thrilled with the music that we just heard from the group of women on the platform. I shall never hear the same rendition of the last song, "Silent Night", unless I remember how it was sung here. How one women can extend herself into all these women and all these women extend themselves into beauty and harmony, which reaches to heaven, is beyond me. I was speaking at a commencement in a small town where very frequently the music is awful. I was very young and ardent and in the chorus the soloist woman was off key. I said to the man sitting next to me, 'That woman ought to be killed" and the man said "Then I would be a widower." - Professor Charles Beard, of whom some of you know as a historian, and who I spent six weeks with, told this story on him - self. He was spending the summer in the woods of Maine, when one da^ some mail came addressed to Dr. Charles Beard. The mailman asked him, as he picked up his mail. "What are you a doctor of?" A doctor of Philosophy", he replied. That's funny, I have never heard of anyone having that." Philosophy is the root meaning of love of knowledge. He who thinks he knows what controls life and death, is a philosopher. To understand it in a more general way. Philosophy is manifested to us in serenity or peacefulness, or you can detect it in those people who are restful and not tossed about with every word of doctrine, with every emotion of their lives- who have wisdom, who are conscious of living, not just existing and with whom life is an experience. People who live consciously and under - standingly in this universe from experience, can say, " I know" and can restfully sit back and put it all in God's hands. Being a phil - osopher, I think I know how to live in this universe. Now no matter what we have known or how serenely we live, there is a time when all our philosophy fails. Humanity is passing through a crisis and this is a time for hopeful living. lam trying to struggle even though the effort seems hopeless. In these days when my wife sees the headlines in the paper, she says, "Why doesn't God do something?" in a time like this, I believe in an organized universe, a power which holds the universe together although our man's little world seems to be going to pieces. I believe in God and God is love, though, as I say, it is hard to believe anything these days so critical in the history of'man - kind. :¦;,. ¦ ••¦ •¦ ... -.. - ' . :. : ¦ .... Henry Van Loon, whom some ot you may read about, was a reg - ular lunatic and in his Geography he said, "If all humanity were puti together in a box and placed on the rim of the Grand Canyon of Colorado and given a push, it would topple down into the canyon </seg>
         <seg id="p354">KKI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 352 and that would be the end of humanity." Everything that lives, man tries to destroy, but it would be a dead universe if he did not, for it is the consciousness that gives man the inspiration to stay. There would be no colors, no music, no watching 1 of sunrise or sun - ret. Now I believe in humanity, stupid and wicked as it often is. 1 believe that we could work it out some way, if some of us were pood enough and wise enough to discover what the divine purposes are. and learn to work in the line of God. Now the crisis we are in at the present time, arises out of con - flicting philosophies. The individual has something in himself of infinite worth that is capable of working together with God and his fellow creatures to find out what the divine purposes are. The stream of love is the divine essence and only as these individuals love their realm and appoint themselves to be leaders, can the ¦world be. We believe that man as a Christian is capable of working to - gether with God and his fellow men. Above all else, I would like to have you discover the sources of tbls democracy of ours which is the sick patient and in a crisis. Democracy springs from two sources; first, the Latin-French hum - anism idea, then from the Anglo-Saxon humanism in the Christian relifion. The American Revolution spirit goes over into the econ - omic field. But the Anglo-Saxton democracy is more ancient In origin, its beginnings are in the Bible. It is the first essence of man's inborn dignity; it was the hand of God that lifted man out of the dust. Even the fall of man adds to his height, falling to rise again to higher levels. Man is lost, but he can climb his way back to freedom. It is an unfinished quest of man. When we talk about freedom and the dignity of man we are not talking of something that was born in him. We have lost all freedom to find these two. The dignity of man once lost, is hard to recover. Xow for centuries in this land of ours, these two conceptions of democracy have lived side by side. This has become the land of the free end the land of the constitution. This land of ours has become the hope of mankind and still is. I have letters which cover my desk, which, If I answer, are death warrants, that come frc.m people whose only hope is this land. The fact that land like this still exists, gives courage to me, for this land of ours might have been the Kingdom of Heaven upon earth with our conception of freedom, if we had taken in the code of honorship and respons - ibility which we have not. The other day I saw a movie which was taken by the govern - ment, named the "Mississippi". The picture was like the voice of a prophet. All the way from Pennsylvania, to Idaho, we find that every creek, river and lake finds its way into the Mississippi. You </seg>
         <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 353 can see the wasteful cutting down of trees and the washing down of top soil, which is being carried farther down into the Gulf of Mexico. We have no responsibility for the future. I talked to you this morning of being in a .mining town and everywhere as far as you can travel, you can see that man is taking everything out of mother earth and putting nothing back. There are dreary chapters in the story of this country of ours so dark and dreary that we do not want our children to read them and lose the respect for man and the whole race. The faces of the women in this town impressed me. There is this human material here, the best in the world, and yet not as good as It might be because wo haven't filled our obligations. Sometimes I wish all of us would be sent to Russia and could return. Then in spite of the floods, high taxes, etc., we would still be glad we are here. There are a lot of things you should be proud of in America, for something is being j achieved here every minute that is worth while. Philosophy owes its hold on the masses through which it is projecting to religion. That is what brings that glow .. icj the faces of these people. Now the religion element in demo - cracy is from a vastly higher basis. The other.day an ex-service man presided over a meeting. The motto which he chose for his republic was "The Truth Prevails You." Democracy is the political realization of God here upon earth. With - in the democratic reign of organized life, you can be a Christian. Tflat is, you can build the Kingdom of God upon earth. It is not that it is a different form of government, but that it is spiritual. The cry of millions must mean nothing to you. You cannot think of justice, for the principle of Democracy is that we always consider the well being of the individual and his soul as equivalent to ours and not to consider one man or another great or one race superior and another inferior and he demands that we all act accordingly. Democracy demands that we think not merely to exist as a form of government but as a spirit. It demands first of all absolute good will toward man, as we hear it now coming up from Christmas night, secondly, tolerance. That does not .mean that I tolerate an - other race or another face, but that I understand what is back of their meaning. Then truth. Truth is absolute good will. Truth and the love of it, the general practical love of our neighbor. We are made of all things and all religions and all colors, for better or for worse, we have to save the future for our children. And now, my friends, I come to you believing that the demo - cratic way of living will prevail because it is the human way, the normal way. It will be curbed but some of these days it will break through and the democratic spirit will persist. </seg>
         <seg id="p356">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I was working as an immigrant at the Oliver factory. I am proud I laid foundation for all of our wealth. In the basement of this factory we were grinding tools. A fine looking man came in one day, smiling, and gave all of us cigars and invited us to the saloon. There were barrels of beer and, most of the men were laborers and they drank all night. And when they didn't know what they were doing, they were led to the polls to vote. We aliens, all of us, were sworn in that we had a right to the franchise. We voted the straight Republican ticket. In 1932, at the close of the Cemurj 01 Progress Exposition in Chicago, my wife said, "Let's go over and see Jane Addams" and I said, "She is not in Chicago now, she is in Maine." My wife, being an insistent person, called Miss Addam's home and found her there, so we went over for tea. Her house was crowded with women from all parts of the world who came for Congress that was held dur - ing- that year. A friend, who had not seen Chicago, asked me to show her around. While doing this I was telling her of the bad things of the United States and of the rising tide of racial prejudice which is getting worse and worse. People have to learn to under - stand one another. Then she jerked my arm with terrific force and said, "Dr. Steiner, you should get down on your knees and thank God for this last refuge of Democracy and I believe you will realize the future of mankind depends on your Philosophy of Life." Do you have good will? Are you tolerant? If you have those, the future is safe for you, for your children, and for humanity. Mrs. Eshelman: This afternoon we have another good speaker with us who is to speak along the line of keeping our children well. This is one of our worth while things and I am pleased at this time to present This speaker to you—Dr Hancock. Dr. Hancock: Those who arranged this program must have had a grudge against me, for asking me to speak after such a wonderful oration. I want to say that I am particularly grateful to talk to this group and I am perfectly sincere in saying that it is one of the most im - portant organizations in the state. Organized Agriculture is in a position to do things that no other organization is. I hope that 1 can make .myself heard. If not, will you please let me know. I have a few simple facts to present to you. We have problems and solutions or suggestions as to how we may solve them. There are a good many reasons why we should be interested in the health of rural children. We have had in the United States what we might </seg>
         <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION call a rural tradition. We have thought the rural child was better off than the city child, and we have found, in many ways, that was true. People had not learned to live in cities, but the city child is| now fully superior to the rural child. Th*is is one of the reasons why we should be interested in rural health in Nebraska. We can have the sodhouse candidate for governor and that cannot happen in any other state in the Union. Another reason why we should be interested in the health of these children is because we have fewer of them. That is some - thing you may not have realized or stopped to think about. But it is true that our birth rate is decreasing and our infant mortality has dropped from about 57 to 45, something like 20%. That is a very big improvement, but our birth rate had dropped from 26 to 16 orj a drop of 30%. At that rate, we won't have many children in Nebraska. /There are fewer children under 12 than there are over, in| each agel This means that we must endeavor to save as many children as possible to keep our population'even. We are not over - populated in children. The children of today are our citizens of to - morrow. They cannot provide for their own health, so we must do it for them. If we do not provide for it now, we are going to pay for it later. ; : It is a good idea to take an interest in the health of Nebraska chldren, particularly the rural children. The health of the child is really the parent's responsibility. I am going to outline for you what constitutes a good healthy child. Assume the child Is born a jvell baby. It is then in our hands and we are responsible for its well being from then on. The best means of assuring health for that child is constant medical supervision and the best advisor you can have is a medical doctor. This baby should be taken to the doctor at least once a month during the first year, even though it is well. On these visits the doctor will examine the baby for defects, adyise about the care, feeding, etc. Sometime during the second half of that year, he will do many things. He will immunize the baby against dtptheria in the last six months of the first year. During 1938 we have had something like 150 cases of diptheria in Nebraska. There should be no diptheria as there is medicine now forj absolute prevention. Another thing is small pox vaccination during the first year. Many doctors will give whooping cough im - munization "because they feel it is worth while and should be given during the first year. During the second year, the baby should be examined about four times. This is the ideal'program. During the remainder of the pre-schobl years, two examinations during a year ar^ sufficient. Very few children need a doctor called during pre - school years, but there should be pre-school examinations until situations are corrected, if they are correctable, and the immuniza- </seg>
         <seg id="p358">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tions should be tested or repeated. Another thing that should be done before child enters school is a tubercular test to see if child has been infected with the disease. Then an examination once a year during the remainder of the school years. There are a good many reasons why such a program for their child is not possible for many people. First is cost, as you no doubt know such a program is costly, but not so much as one may think. We can talk all we want about an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but people will not buy that ounce. We need to set up some sort of compromise between no care at all and a good deal of care. You can go without part of the program and get along. It is a gamble, of course, but sometimes we gamble and we win. We can turn some of this to other organizations, in many cases, the school, for in that sense, school health work is somewhat of a com - promise. If the child was given support by the parents it would not be necessary to have immunization and all things of this sort through the school. Because of this lack of individual health care, it has become necessary for the government to take on a good many of these func - tions. If care is not being rendered by individuals, it must be ren - dered by someone else. It is possible for a state or local city gov - ernment to assist us. They have proven all right. There are some individual substitutes. For instance, we can. raise a child by a book and books are splendid things, but when we attempt to raise a child by book it will be like our first cake baked by a recipe, it will not come out right. If you do not have medical advice available, use the book, but nevertheless it is not the last word. The same is true of magazines, pamphlets, and all material we would use. Another thing that might be called a substitute for it has been the custom over Nebraska to have County Fairs and they will have a baby show as a big feature of that fair. The babies are marked and checked and the parents think they are doing something for that child. Mothers sometimes try to conceal the defects. We should have a baby clinic for the purpose of checking over the conditions of the child, rather than just to win the prize. There are certain responsibilities that cannot be taken over by an individual person, such as the water condition, etc. These are the responsibilities of the community. Unfortunately, over most of rural Nebraska we have no organized health work. You doubtless know the set-up over most of the state. The sheriff is health officer and the physician is advisor to him. No profitable health work at all. Nebraska has been lucky, for in spite of all, health conditions </seg>
         <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION have been good. We have one of the lowest mortality records In the states. We have one of two of the lowest tuberculosis death rates in the country. We also have one of the lowest maternal death rates in the country. We are healthy in Nebraska for several reasons, some of which I know. It is obvious that we have intelligent pop - ulation. We actually are in better financial condition than people o^ any other state. We also have no great public health problem such as malaria, hookworm, or something in that order and instead o ( f this being an alibi, it should really be an incentive to make our state better than it is. With a small amount of money, we could have the best health record in the United States. The maternal death rate minimum is ten. We already have eighteen and it would be very easy to get it down to ten. The same thing holds true with infant mortality. It should be a challenge, not to sit back, but to spend money and make our state better that it now is. Our state is doing 1 nothing along this line. The state health department is taking on a program of infant and child health. The exhibit in the corner will tell you about this. It is being carried on a budget of $48,000 a year, 2/ 3 O f which is federal money, $16,000 is state money and % is used for maternal and the other % for infant health. In spite of this small appropriation, our state is doing very much. Another project that is being carried on is the tuberculosis campaign which is made possible by state funds. It is called a survey, but is really tuberculosis eradication. Five counties have already been covered, Buffalo county is now being added. Wherever money is appropriated it is spent in the best possible way. The plan is to go into a county and give as many tuberculin tests as possible, then make plans for proper care of those who show signs of the disease. Nebraska has done an excellent piece of work. All we need now is to see that the children be given the necessary care. Another program that is being carried on is the crippled child - ren's program. It seems rather strange that such a program would be limited to children. At any rate, the crippled children's program is being carried on and probably every crippled child in the state W|ho needs care, has either been put under care in the best way, or has been listed as not needing 1 treatment. There are 4,000 crippled children in Nebraska. So far all the demands have been met and an enormous amount of good is being done. Whether this crippled children's program is only a start on a general program of medical care or whether it is is ah emotional thing that will pass, I do not know. It is another such thing for which a definite program of individual responsibility is necessary. It is always the children who have no parents who are deeply neglected and who are wards of the state. We have six institutions which care for some 3,000 child - ren. The Board of Control is taking steps to stengthen medical services. Complete medical service is extended to all institutions. </seg>
         <seg id="p360">KKIMJRT UF XKBItASKA STATIC BOARD OF AGRICfLTL'RB One gets (he impression in all of these places, that there Is a good deal of overcrowding and that we need more institutions, but if services were improved, the turnover would be increased enough so that overcrowding would disappear. The overcrowding is largely due, not to lack of room, but to lack of service, therefore it is ques - tionable whether we need more buildings. In many hospitals, better service would result in more children being' served. We would no longer have the waiting list. With all of these programs in action and with education going on, the future generation should be able to solve all these problems that will be confronting them. -Mrs. Eshelman: Thank you. Dr. Hancock. At this time we have a lady with us who would like to talk to us for a few minutes. Mrs. Haupt, who for 21) years has worked with the Indians in Nebraska.

Susanna" and page 29, 'Joy to the World." Mrs. Gard: This morning we are going to learn about freezer lockers and how to use them more efficiently. It seems this new method of meat preservation should do much to make easier and cheaper the winter butchering job. We can do more with freezing than we can with canned and cured products. In learning to use the free-er lockers efficiently we have two men here to tell us about them. Mr. Loeffel. who is professor of Animal Husbandry at the University of Nebraska. He has served as president of the American Society of </seg>
         <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Animal Production. Mr. Loeffel is well known in Nebraska and nationally for his work in Animal Husbandry. We are also glad to have Mr. Mackintosh. He is a Scotchman and a graduate of the University, of Minnestoa. He is noted as an outstanding, authority on meat investigation. At this time I am most happy to present Mr. Loeffel and Mr. Mackintosh. :f . - : .-,.• ¦ ¦¦. USING FREEZER LOOKERS EFFICIENTLY Wm. J. Loeffel: . A wide range of products may be stored efficiently in freezer lockers. Probably greatest efficiency can be secured from the lock - erj.by storing all foods in season. lam planning! to confine my re - marks primarily to meat and meat food products. The meat food products which are removed from the locker will [be no better than the products which were stored there. In other jwords, the person v.ho puts choice quality meat in his locker will probably get better satisfaction at the table than the person who stores the meat from .unfinished,- aged, or low grade animals. ¦ -i- ¦-'.-¦¦. ¦ ¦•' ¦ •--. ¦'.' j. In slaughtering and cutting, the meat should be handled in a cleanly manner. Contamination of any kind reduces the keeping quality of meat. Unnecessary handling should be; avoided. | .-'.' ¦ ' .- ¦;.'.' •¦'-_. ¦ .- ¦ ¦\ j j Beef : and lamb, if well finished, are improvedl by aging-that is holding the temperatures of 34-360 for ten days to two weeks. With pork, aging or ripening is not necessary. Low grade beef, particu - larly if lacking in covering, cannot be aged. . j One of the chief problems in storing frozen meat is to prevent freezer burn or drying out as a result of low temperatures. This can be avoided by wrapping the meat in a special type of paper which excludes the air. We have had good success with paper known as deodorized oiled kraft paper. If a tight package is made, there is nojlikelihood of loss of moisture through this wrapping. It has.suf - ficiput body so that it may be taken from the meat without de - frosting. There are other types of paper recommended for this purpose, chief among which is a high grade parchment paper. Or - dinary butcher paper is not suitable since it is usually more or less brittle, is porous, and sticks very tightly to the frozen meat. : In wrapping packages, the size and kind will depend upon the size of the family, the distance they are located from the freezer locker, and the frequency with which new supplies of frozen meat can be obtained. A family with refrigeration facilities naturally can package meat in larger bundles than the family without such facili - ties Some families place only one kind of meat in a package. One </seg>

         <seg id="p364">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE package will contain only steaks, and another roasts and so forth. Some families like to make larger packages and have them contain a variety of meats. For example each package will contain a roast, some steak, and perhaps some boiling beef. In cutting beef for wrapping, the likes of the particular family should be taken into consideration. As a general rule all trimming should be done before freezing. Unnecessary bones should be re - moved for they not only take valuable space in the locker but also frequently cause breaks in the wrapping paper. Where several cuts of meat are placed in the same package they should be interleaved - that is a sheet of parchment or oiled paper should be placed be - tween them so that the cuts may be separated without defrosting them. Where ground beef is prepared it is usually suggested that the patties be made before the meat is frozen and the patties separated by oiled paper. Thi3 will obviate the need for defrosting. Butter cartons make a satisfactory container for ground meat products. It is generally recommended that sausage not be seasoned until it is removed from the freezer locker. Best results with freezer lockers are obtained where a sharp freezer is available to completely and quickly freeze the meat before it is placed in the locker. Uniformity of temperature in the freezer plant is important. There is nothing quite so destructive of meat as to have a constant fluctuation in temperature. There are molds which grow at temperatures as low as 19 degrees. Consequently we are inclined to suggest the freezer locker temperatures should be held from 5 to 10°. It is imperative that the locker plant be kept clean and sanitary, for meat readily absorbs foreign odors and taints. The packages of meat should all be Identified with a tag af - fixed, giving the date, name of the owner, and kind of meat con - tained. This is exceedingly helpful in removing package for use. I know of one woman who keeps a catalog on her kitchen cabinet door—every package being numbered with a statement of contents. She checks off the packages as they are brought home and thereby knows just what is available. Fresh pork is very difficult to keep. One of the complications which we encounter is a breaking down of the fat, becoming rancid when exposed to the air. This may be materially reduced by the use of an oil paper wrapping. There are certain oiled papers avail - able in which some of the fillers used are soluble in grease, and some very bad results have been obtained where such papers have been used. We" have seen some housewives try to use lightweight </seg>
         <seg id="p365">XEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 361 paraffin papers or bread wrappers, with very unsatisfactory results This paper soon becomes water-soaked, is easily broken and aticks to the meat very tightly when it is removed from the locker. . FREEZER LOCKERS David L. Mackintosh Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station . Manhattan, Kansas An adequate food supply is usually the first consideration of every individual and more particularly the head of. the family. ¦\yhere land is available the best and usually the cheapest way for the family to abtain an adequate food supply is to produce it and preserve it at home. •: Temperature control seems to be the best and most efficient method of preserving perishable food products. Such products can be kept for a short period of time at a temperature of 34° to 40° F., which can be secured by the use of ice. For preservation over a longer period of time, sterilization through the use of high tem - peratures (2400 F.) as in canning, has;long been practiced in some form by practically every housewife. The most recent development in preserving is by low temperature or by freezing. Preservation by freezing has been known and practiced for many years in some countries but only in recent years has this service became available to the farm families of this country. The freezer locker idea had its beginning within the past quar - ter century, but has only shown rapid growth during the past four or five years. Probably this delayed growth was due somewhat to the reluctance of the American housewife to accept frozen foods on a jpar with fresh foods. At least it is true that the American people have frowned upon frozen foods until recent years. That the house - wife now accepts frozen foods seems to be indicated by the thriving condition of nearly 1200 locker plants operating over a quarter of a million lockers In the United States today. This means that about 200,000 families in this country are using freezer lockers as a means ofj providing a more adequate and more economical family food supply. The cold storage locker plant may be owned and operated as a cooperative or as a private enterprise. The plants in operation differ widely in size, type and services performed. The simplest plant observed to date is located in a north central Kansas town where the proprietor of a rather antiquated ice plant allows people to store foods in an old ice storage room where a temperature of </seg>
         <seg id="p366">KKI'oKT (IF XKBKAHKA STATK BOAKI) OF AGRICULTURE about 20= F. is maintained. The charges are one cent a pound for storage, the charge being made when the goods are placed in storage and no further check of any kind is made. The patron, after weighing in, places the food to be stored wherever he can, and as best he can—no boxes, bins or lockers being provided. Needless to say the storage room can best be described as a "grand moss" anil one that would be hard to picture in words. However, the signifi - cant fact is that when the proprietor endeavored to discontinue thiy service, primarily because it was too much bother to him, he dis - covered he was offering a service, which in spite of all its short - comings, was demanded by a group of patrons and as a result the? service is still maintained and in all probability will never be im - proved upon in tliis particular case. From this type we progressed gradually upwards insofar as conditions and services rendered are concerned. Many produce plants maintain lockers primarily for the use of their patrons. These lockers are all of home-made construction usually neatly arranged in tiers in a cooler where, in most cases, a temperature of 15° F. or lower is maintained. No additional services are offered to the patrons of this type of storage. As a whole the conditions sur - rounding the storage room are satisfactory but many improvements could be made. A third type is usually associated with an ice or cold storage plant. Here we find a locker .room similar to those described above but added facilities are available to the patrons. Space for chilling carcasses is sometimes available and in some cases a sharp freezer. A cutting room and processing room is nearly always available and the cutting and wrapping may be done by the owner of the meat himself, or by some other individual—as a retired meat cutter who is on call. In a few cases such plants hire an attendant, either oi&gt; the straight salary or by the job, who takes care of these added services. The four general group comprises those plants sometimes spoken of as complete plants. That is to say, tliey offer complete servfoe including an attendant who does all or nearly all the cutting, proces - sing, and wrapping. In Kansas such plants are usually associated with some other type of enterprise that uses refrigeration as an ice plant, privately owned cream or produce station, ice cream plant, retail meat market, general mercantile stare, or cold storage plant. By complete service is meant facilities for (a) chilling carcasses; (b) aging meat; (c) cutting and packaging; (d) processing; and le) sharp freezing, as well as the regular locker room. For each of these services a specified fee is charged. These fees vary very materially between plants but it seems to be the prevailing opinion that the receipts fram processing fees more than equal the income </seg>

The fifth group includes only a few plants more or less of the deluxe type and by this we mean complete plants where the sole, business is that of private food storage for individual owners. In many cases these plants are elaborately equipped. Where such plants have been installed there seems to be a itendancy to expand into other lines of business which require refrigeration so that at the present time there are only one or two plants where the sole bus - iness is that of food storage. I In general freezer lockers have developed in much the same manner as "Topsy"—"just grew up." Available information of an authoritative nature .has been scarce and progress has been mostly by. the trial and error method; which is usually rather expensive. Information secured from plant owners and from first hand obser - vation indicates that there are still many unsolved problems. We will mention only a-few of the questions that come up almost daily. 1. Is a sharp freezer necessary? Observations indicate that while a sharp freezer is not absolutely necessary, the addition of a sharp freezer insures rapid and complete freezing of all products This minimizes shrink, freezer burn, and losses. in general. How - ever, some plants are being successfully operated without such a unit. . '¦¦'¦• - ;. •• ¦. -¦.¦¦¦ ¦ . ¦- ¦ " 2. What type of paper should be used to wrap meat? Ideas on this subject have changed rapidly during the past two years. Ordinary meat wrapping paper, parchment paper, and cheap oil paper have been found unsatisfactory. Several paper companies have developed heavy, tough, glazed, water-proof papers for this purpose which are proving much more satisfactory. There are also avail - able wrapping papers which have been treated with anti-oxygens which have a particular value when storing pork. Recently cello - phane has been advocated for wrapping- pork. There is still a great need for definite information on the question of wrapping and packag - ing. Double-waxed containers are proving very satisfactory for the storage of ground meat, poultry, and vegetables. These containers can be made perfectly air-tight. 3. What is the best type of locker? The lockers in use vary very widely in. structure. The earlier lockers were little more! than wooden crates stacked on top of one another. Next came the wood - en frame covered with fine chicken wire or hailsoreen. This was followed by the closed front locker and. today there are a number of I commercially built lockers available. Some of these steel lockers are open, while the latest type is completely enclosed and nearly air-tight. "-¦ These commercial lockers have removable racks which permit a thorough cleaning when necesary. Further informa- </seg>
         <seg id="p368">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion is still needed to determine what type of locker is really best suited for this purpose. 4. How can molds be prevented? Temperature control seems to be the best answer to this question. Where molds have given trouble the storage temperature has ranged from 150 f. to 20° F., and in some cases where it has been suggested to the operator that a temperature of 100 F. or lower be used, molds have been elimina - ted. The use of a sharp freezer together with a maximum tempera - ture of 100 F. in the storage room seems to solve this question. 5. Should meat be aged before freezing? Pork should be chill - ed, cut, and frozen as rapidly as possible. Beef and lamb carrying some finish should be allowed to age from 7 to 14 days before cut - ting. 6. Should hot carcasses be chilled in the same room where meat is being aged? Wherever possible and the volume of business justifies it, separate coolers should be used though it is not absolutely necessary that there be a solid wall separating the coolers. A heavy canvas may be used to divide a cooler and satisfy the requirements. 7. Should fish be stored with other meats? This seems to be a debatable question but where fish are first put through the sharp freezer and glazed no difficulties with odor or taste have been notic - ed. This is another point in favor of a sharp freezer. The question of transmitting flavor from one product to another while in a frozen condition is one that should receive some attention, as opinions seem to differ materially. 8. Can cured meat be stored? Cured meats can be stored. However, in most cases cured meats should not require freezing in order to keep them for several months. As a general rule meat should not be salted before freezing. Sausage and ground beef keep better if stored without salt or spices, but neither should be stored for any length of time. 9. How long can meat be kept in a freezer locker? Theoreti - cally, meat may be kept in a frozen state for almost an indefinite period. However, in actual practice even with the latest develop - ments in processing and wrapping it is advisable to use pork within six months. After that time rancidity may reach such a stage as to render pork unpalatable, though it has been stored sucessfully for longer periods in a number of cases. Rancidity in pork seems to be the most common complaint received by plant operators. BeeE and lamb, particularly the larger cuts, may be stored for a year or longer but it is advisable to use all meat within twelve months to prevent excessive drying. Good quality poultry also keeps well if glazed before placing in the locker. </seg>
         <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION .., \ o' How snould frozen meats be handled prior to cooking? This is^also a debatable question but experimental evidence indicates n should be cooked without thawing.. This .means that the cooking process should be carried on at a lower temperature and for a longer Period than is the case with fresh meat. This fits into the latest developments In meat cookery where slow cooking is advocated for all meat. If meat is allowed to thaw before cooking, the thawing should be done under cover, preferably in an ice box and cooking should follow without delay. These are only a few of the many questions asked almost daily in connection with the freezer locker situation. In spite of the lack of information the fact remains that where properly handled the freezer locker idea has sold-itself. The majority of the patrons are well satisfied and renew their contracts. Where the housewife is questioned she is strong for the freezing process of preservation, and her long standing prejudice against frozen foods is fast disappear - ing Where available and used judiciously the freezer locker has lightened the load of the housewife and has made available a greater variety of homegrown fruits, vegetables and meats throughout the year. It has also made available a more adequate and economical food supply, particularly for the farm folks. Questions asked by the group and answered by both Mr. Mackin - tosh and Mr. Loeffel: Q. Where plants do not have sharp freezer, shouldn't pieces be spread out? A. Most assuredly. . Q. What do you think of the cutting method? If you are going to use the freezer locker, would you use common cuts, or would you moderate the cutting system? A. I would moderate the cutting to fit individual needs and re - quirements. I think it is up to the individual, their likes and dislikes. Q. What yould you say to those folks who do not care for fat? A. I would Bay they are making the mistakes of their lives. Use fat for cooking whenever you can. Q. Don't you think we should say something about braising and . broiling and the difference between the two? A. If we have a cut of meat which is lacking in tenderness we should prepare it by braising. When braising we use moisture. Whenever we put a.lid on meat, it means we are using a mois - ture way of cooking. By broiling we mean exposing the meat </seg>
         <seg id="p370">REPORT OF XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE directly to the hear. We use high temperature though not as high as we used to think we needed. In broiling we mean to place cuts of meat so they will be three inches from heating element. Brown meat ten minutes on each side for steak 1% inches thick. Q. Can steaks of good quality be broiled after freezing? A. You can broil frozen steaks if you warm it up slowly and then turn up the heat. Q. What do you think of storing smoked meat in the same locker with fresh meat? A. It the meat is cured and smoked and a good job is done of both. there is no reason for putting it in a locker. It will not freeze through anyway. Q. Wouldn't it be better to give the meat a mild cure and keep it in the freezer locker, rather than over-cure it and not put it in the freezer? A. I believe in curing it to the just right stage. If you are using a light cure it is a good thing. Some lockers will not permit cured or smoked meat at all. Q. How about keeping fish in the lockers? A. Some lockers will not permit fish, but others do. They have found a way whereby fish can be dipped in water and then stored In the lockers, giving the fish a sort of glazed finish. Mrs. Gard; I know you have all enjoyed this fine discussion and demon - stration that was given on the freezer locker and I am sure Mr Loeffel will be willing to give help with this locker work at any time.

         <seg id="p374">ItKIMIHT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 370 healthfully. I think this is something this campus needs particularly. Mrs. Sindt: I am sure if you could hear Miss Fedde give you her dream picture of this building we would see the necessity much better. Miss Fedde's explanation of Resolution six: Today, as you know, we have 2,500 appointed officers in the State House. Every time the administration changes, many people lose their jobs. We want our government on a merit system even for stenographers. This idea is to have examinations taken and when a man passes that examination he does not lose his job when a new administration comes in whether he be democrat or republican. This bill is to be introduced in the legislature and is going to have hard sledding as it is political. We should know about it and get informed about it ourselves. I know that if anyone feels that we do not know enough about the bill, they would rather withdraw it than to have it turned down by the legislature. .Miss Fedde's explanation of Resolution seven: I was on this committee last year and I have sort of had it on my mind throughout the year. We are going to have another reso - lution about the teacher retirement bill and how it works out for ten years at least. It is the same problem with the social secretary and the teacher. I attended one of these hearings and they brought up the fact that many teachers say they would like to retire and are really too old to teach but have to go on because they have nothing to live on. This bill would make it possible for teachers to retire at «" and make it compulsory at 65. They would get a minimum of $300.00 a year. That money would come partly from the teachers and part from the state. If the teacher should leave the service and move into another state, the money she has paid in will be turn - ed back to her. It would mean that we would get better service from our teachers. Rather than have this bill turned down, we would rather withdraw it. We do not want it passed if you do not care to stick with it. The idea is a good one. I hope enough of you know more about it so that it will be passed. Are there any com - ments? The question, "To whom do we write" was asked in connection with Resolution thirteen. Following is Miss Fedde' explanation: You can write to the sponsor of the program or to the station itself. It might be well to do both. I understand this program of "One Man's Family" at one time was sponsored by a tobacco con - cern and fan letters came by the thousand so they had to find an - other sponsor. Four hundred fan letters are necessary for keeping a program on the air and 200 fan letters take the program off the ::ir. The networks are trying to build up their programs, so if there </seg>

         <seg id="p376">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Dr. Aitken. We are drawing near the close of the .meeting and I would like to express my appreciation. There is very little to say except that I shall try to carry through the year till the next ses - sion. Before we close, let me remind you of the afternoon session. I know you will like to see and hear Mrs. Simms, one of the speakers of the program. FRIDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 0, 1938 MRS. ALVIN GARD, Presiding Mrs. David Simms, of Hastings, was presented to the audience as the first speaker of the afternoon. She is International Chairman of The Business and Professional Women's Club. Mrs. Simms: I think we all enjoyed the lovely music we just heard. I thought as I hea&gt;rd it, no matter what we do, we can always sing. Not long ago I spoke before a group and after I was finished, the committee handed me a very large check and I looked at it with some surprise. I said, "This surely is not for me". They said, "Yes, and we wonder if you would endorse the check and hand it back to us to be used toward a certain fund." I asked what the fund was and they said, "For better speakers." I know you will have a better one after I am through. When we look at World Affairs I know we have a big subject on our hands. In world affairs, the thing to do, it seems, is to look back to the past four or five generations. If your ancestors happen to be Jews, you are, no doubt, not wanted in many countries sucli as Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc. This is a shocking statement. I want to talk about the situation of the Jews and I would like you to know it is not personal. My Jewish friends have helped me with many facts I could not have gotten otherwise. I could tell you story after story of things I have seen myself, which are unbelleveable, and every story I tell you has at least ten witnesses. I recently returned from Europe where I have gone for a num - ber of years. I brought back one idea. Two years ago we were filled with Fascism which seemed to be the topic of the day. Fascism means all for one and that means one lone man, a dictator. Two years ago the figure was Mussolini. The general opinion seems to be that Mussolini has fallen. Today we are wondering if Mussolini is as strong and as popular as a few years ago. Today, at least, Mussolini is in the headlines and newspapers more than any other man. He is taking more territory. One dictator's luck worked, so why not another's. </seg>

You will still find that same kindliness today. The streets of Vienna are very quiet, whereas they used to be the gayest and happiest of any city in the world. But today windows of the stores are smashed and boarded, and on other store windows red paint has been smeared and Jew has been written. In Germany, red paint means blood. Every once in a while in Vienna there is a day chosen and you never know when this will come, no matter who it is, if you have a drop of Jewish blood in you, you will have to scrub those cobblestones untnl dark. Very frequently a Jewish man is missing. Maybe he has gone out on the porch after the milk or has sneaked to a nearby store and he does not come back. You will have to put yourself in the place of the women over there, waiting for father, son or brother to return. Being a Jew, they dare not inquire. They have no pro - tection at all. A Jewish woman will receive a note with a few ashes saying, "Here he is, do not grieve." We love our Germans, but how long are the people going to ttand for what is going on? I can"t believe that the German people will allow these things that are going on. We had been in Germany visiting our friends and seeing people that we knew. The Germans always laugh at our thin girls, for they like them fat over there. The Germans everywhere say, "You Americans, are you happy? Are you really that happy or are you putting on? We hear such terrible things about you in our country." And we turn right around and ask them the very same question. We must know that the people around the world are just the same as we are down inside. Ideals, hopes and ambitions are just the same around the world. When are the people of the world going to get together and stop this three, four or five men governing the world as it is today? While walking down the street a lady selling gloves must have noticed that we were Americans and she said, "Aren't you Capitalists and don't you live in a Capitalistic democracy? Come here and see this pretty pair of gloves, they are only 75&lt;f here and you would pay three or four dollars for them at home." I said, "I would like to take them home but I cannot afford it." "Can't afford it", she said, "I thought you were a capitalist." People over there have a very different idea about this capitalistic movement. Then when they see you and see how honest you are, they are as amazed at us as we are at them. So many people come back from Germany and everyone tells us a different story. You ask someone beside you the same question and they will tell you an entirely different answer. You ask eight people and you will get eight different answers.

Hitler has given to his youth a motto by which they live if you have been in Germany in the past few years, you have seen it across the sfcreet. "Strength through Joy" Hitler has given to his youth No matter how insignificant your Job is. love it and get every bit of joy out of your work and that will bring you slengt?

         <seg id="p380">UKI'ORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 376 ary. But Hitler already has his eye on their oil wells. After the war, Hitler stripped Romania of everything. She was ruined. He then went to Hungary and if it had not been for Mussolini's help at that time, Hungary could never have carried on. The men do not like each other. They are not the friends we think they are, but the, need each other. They are using each other and some time soon both will want that part of Hungary. Hungary has eight million people and only enough food to feed two million. In Hungary we find starvation. We find hunger as I have never seen hunger before. We had a chance to become friends of some of the best thinkers of the world. I met a woman who was a fine thinker living in Hungary. Every afternoon while the rest of our congregation went to tea, this Hungarian woman and I got together and tried to explain to each other what our countries were like. Two years ago when we returned from Italy after having seen the King and Queen off, I read in the paper about the King and Queen's visit and how the Queen had given, what I thought at the time, worthless coins to these desperate people. This amused me so much that I tore out the article and saved it. This year I sat in Budapest with the woman who was one of the people to whom the Queen gave one of these coins. The woman reached down in her pocket and brought out the worth - less coin saying, "take this, for, as the queen said to me, 'it is a symbol of friendship". And to think I laughed when a queen gave a token of friendship to a desperate woman. This woman told me her son went to Germany to join one o£ Hitler's armies. I said "Did you know he was going?" "Yes", she said, "I made him go. He did not want to and begged me to let him stay, but 1 forced him to go. You don't understand that, do you Mrs. Simms? All these years I have known nothing but hunger and have watched my son starve for two years. The reason I made him join was not because I liked Hitler and the things he has been doing, but because I knew he would at least get one square meal a day." After she had said this she looked at me for a while and then said, "I don't think we understand each other." Why cant the people of one nation understand what the people of another nation are going through?

Now that Hitler has spread a great racial hatred all over the world, what can you and I do, in a great democracy? Capitalism in the United States means the right to own property.

         <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION of 1935, the after-effects of which we will feel for years and years to come. We are also on the edge of the great dust bowl where day after day, in the springs of 1934, 1935, and 1936, black clouds of dust choked our nostrils and dimmed our skies and increased to almost unbearable degree, the housekeeping duties of the house - wife. Tie inspiration of the topic came to me one Sunday morning when I was conducting a eround table discussion with a group o£ high school seniors, in a Leadership Training Class. We in south central Nebraska were experiencing dust storms: We had the elec - tric light on during the week we had burled a little neighbor boy w.ho had contacted pneumonia from the dust. The daily papers and the radios were blazing forth the devastating stories o£ death anil destruction caused by the flood waters of the great Ohio and Missis - sippi rivers. One senior boy asked, "How can there be a just God who sends dust storms and floods." I said, "A good question, John! but does God send the dust and floods?" | Will you think through with me some of the facts we tried to face that Sunday morning? "¦ ' \- ¦¦-¦-¦ ¦ I Thank goodness, we still find those who have faith in the old creation story in the Good Book. In that story we read how God created earth and every living thing In It. He raised the mountains and covered the lands with the grasses and trees. He set the winds into motion and caused the rains to fall, then created man to have dominion over all he had created. But, now was he to have domin - ion as an exploiter? Listen to this verse. "God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden, to dress it and keep it." Man was put on this good earth as a keeper or guardian. has SlS't^^ dOWII thr°USh "* ageS and' Bee to» ma« nas dealt with this heritage entrusted to him? p In China, we find two great rivers, the Yangtze and the Yellow of ibT Thf in r, r™ wooded 'Bparceiy peopied -« - of! Tibet. They are fed by seemingly inexhaustible snows and bear he mineral matter along with the vegetable materials afforded by, the world's largest mountains and their lush plant cover The Yangtze flows down through dense forests where the pressing popu!, lations could not break through and inaccessibility to transportatfon! facilities prevented cutting away the timbers and plowing m&gt; [Z sods. The fa* that neither the mineral resources nor he junjie have been exploited, together with the fact that the Chinese h ave been clever at handling the soils for centuries, explain why Se fertle Yangtze valley feeds one-fourth of the population of he world today. The Yellow River presents another P Lu re n risen high in the same mountains, but flows down through a more arid </seg>
         <seg id="p384">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE regions, similar to our Great Plains. Here the pressure of the pop - ulations have been insistent. Herd and flocks have pastured the grass lands to the limit and cultivation has been attempted wherever possible. In consequence, tbe Yellow River valley is today a region in which raging floods alternate with blinding dust stor.ms. Tor - rential rains carve the landscape and bear the yellow mud into the stream and down into the populous lowlands. From this vallej' we hear the stories of drouth, famine, and floods in China. A like story exists in India. Great Britain has not been in - different to the problems of soil management in India and her agri - cultural experts are reclaiming the soils and training the populations to 'good keeping" soil practices. However, it takes 2,000 years to build back soils that it has taken 20 years of exploitation to deplete. Egypt, a country which for all practical purposes, consists of a narrow thread of land along the Nile, widening into a delta at the mouth. Her People are mostly hard working placid peasant farmers,' little concerned about "high standards of living.'' Heretofore there, had been for them little trouble about keeping their soil fertile. The annual bath of mud, administered with gentle dignity by the stately Nile, has taken care of that. The authorities, in true high pressure style, realized that the climate in the delta was suitable tor three crops a year instead of one, providing the moisture could be retained. Therefore a system of ditches was planned and three orops raised. This story was too good to last and soon the soils of the delta in the great river Nile, began to show symptoms very much like those of the broken down cotton and tobacco farms of this con - tinent. Egypt, beyond the borders of the Nile, is desert. Both north and south of the Sudan is every evidence of misuse and deter - ioration, ground cover gone, soil washed and blown, In East Africa, the pastures have been overloaded and the soil exposed and blown and washed away, except where the accursed tsetse fly has kept down the cattle population. Next we turn to Europe. She has had the experiences of two great empires to pattern by. The Greek and the Roman. One of the oldest Greek books we know about is a farm almanac. It was written about the Bth century B. C. It is addressed to a public of respectable small farmers, living on their own land and manag - ing it with the help of one or two slaves. Even today the precepts of this almanac are rated as sensible. As the centuries wore on, the owners left the land for others to work it. Presently the landlord was only concerned in his rents and the tenant with what he could squeeze out of the soil. In the end Athens became dependent upon the lands beyond the Dardanelles for shipments of grain and when the enemy shut off that supply she was lost and a conquered nation. The modern Italian, who is a descendant of the great Roman, </seg>
         <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 381 is one of the best farmers the world has ever seen. He can move in upon an abandoned New England stone pile and make it pay One of the greatest agricultural treatises of history was that of Cato. The Rome, for which Cato wrote, had been a land of steady yeoman who knew the soil and were not ashamed to manage it in person. But, in the course of time, yeomanry gave way to tenantry, tenantry to huge holdings by absentee landlords. Roman agriculture started to decline, and that decline started the fall of the great Roman em - pire. Fortunately, a great deal of this Roman wisdom of agriculture spread into northern Europe and has persisted down through the years. Good soil practices followed the Roman church. Every mon - astery had its well dressed gardens and fields and the monks were fat and sleek with well filled granaries. Today the gardens of the old monasteries are marked with patches of savory plants. Yet the most effective soil managements grew up in the Netherlands and the Scandinavian peninsula. Here they must be diligent to con - quer the lowlands and survive. They have conquered and today agriculture has been lifted to the highest plains in these countries and the rural people enjoy the highest standard of living among rural people of the world. These were the only countries after the world war who did not go through a major depression and the little country of Finland is the only country who haß not defaulted to the United States on her war debt. Less than three hundred years ago, white man set foot on this continent of outs, Archeology is proving the theory that this con - tinent has been inhabited as long as the old world. It has been said that the Indian squaw was the best farmer America has ever had. As that may be, the Indian had a keen sense of the dependence of .man upon nature and an aversion to needless waste and the white man found a continent preserved much as God had created it. The white man who drove him out had a strong consciousness of private ownership of property and upon title. It was his to use, enjoy ex - ploit, or ruin, as he would. New England was settled largely by townspeople, not skilled In the art of farming . They were craftsman, Industrious, thrifty, and determined. They spread out over the land, it is true, and mado their own living from the thin rocky soil. But their real energy went into manufacturing, marine enterprises, and business.. South of New England, in New York and Pennsylvania, the country was settled by Germans, Dutch and Swedes, and they went on using the good soil keeping practices that had been used by their forefathers. This section of the United State has no great soil ero - sion and depletion problem today and if our whole continent had </seg>
         <seg id="p386">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE been settled by this type of white men, we would not be having the great Soil Conservation problems or the dust and floods. In the main, the story of the settlement of this continent has been one of exploitation. Driving the Indian out was the first task. That completed, the next ambition was to convert every possible natural resources into dollars and cents. The great forests were cut and milled, mineral deposits mined, swamps drained, grasses plowed, with no thought, conservation and management for the generations to come. As soon as the trees were gone in that locality and the lands would no longer yield abundant crops, man would move far - ther west and take up new lands to exploit. The corn belt has enjoyed a little better fate and to lowa has been given the credit of arresting this blind pillage. An influx of Norwegian and Scandinavian farmers came into these regions and with the aid of the experiment stations and agricultural colleges, farming has been lifted from a make-shift outcast occupation to a well managed enterprise. Needless to say, the soils of the grain belt have not been maintained undiminished, but they have, on the whole, been well managed. The worst error of mana - gement has been the failure to keep an adequate reserve of land unplowed for pasture, meadows and range. This brings us home to Nebraska. We are a part of the Great Plains, a land given to man covered with luxuriant grasses. In Nebraska alone, we have 200 varieties of native grasses. Except for the fertile valleys and portions which could prosper under irriga - tion, those rich grass lands should have been left unscarred by man lor grazing. I lived in western Kansas during the World War and witnessed the final exploitation of those wonderful prairies. Good wheat prices and favorable .rainfall brought train load after train load of tractors, plows, combines and trucks into the country to plow up the grasses. Wheat was planted and sold for $2.30 a bushel, to buy more prairie, to plant more wheat, to raise to feed a war-crazed world. That was twenty years ago. You know the story as well as I. A dry cycle of years followed as they will always follow. The winds blew and took the top soil in its wake. These great plains of -western. Kansas. Nebraska and eastern Colorado are the great watershed for the Republican River valley. When the torrential rains followed the winds and drouth, as they have always done in those regions, the luxuriant grasses which Mr. Lux tells us will hold nine-tenths of the rainfall if preserved as Clod created them, were gone. As a re - sult, we suffered in the Republican River valley, that destructive flood of 1935. In the watersheds of the great Ohio and Mississippi river valleys, not only have the grass lands been exploited, but the </seg>
         <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA. HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION trees and forests as well, so each spring when the rains come those valleys are visited with devastating floods.

Then that boy dresses and keeps that land, adding too, more than he takes from those soils; to hand down to the generations to come. In closing, I would leave with you the words of old Wang Lund, in Pearl Buck's book, "The Good Earth." Wang Lund had loved the land and had stayed with it through famine, drouth, floods, and grasshoppers. In the end he had acquired great estates. As a very old man he heard his sons planning how they would dispose of the land when the old man passed on. They would sell it and go to the great city, and Wang Lund said, "Now, evil, idle sons,—sell the land? It is the end of a family when they sell the land. Out of the land we came and into it we must go, and if you will keep your land you can live, if you sell the land, it is the end." "God took man and put him in the garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it.'' Women's Session Mrs. Leona Davis George gave an illustrated talk on "Fabrics and Designs for Children's Clothing", using Farmers' Bulletin No. 177 8 as a basis. Samples of the designs of slips, sleeping garments for infants, rompers for creeping babies, suits and dresse3 for chil - dren, outfits for summer, winter play suits, and headwear and bibs were shown. The discussion included the following: Many kinds of cotton fabrics are appropriate for preschool chil - dren's clothing, but certain qualities are needed in all children's gar - ments. Because of a child's small size, material should be yielding and flexible if play is to be free and unhampered. Also because a child's skin is sensitive and easily irritated by anything prickly or harsh, only fabrics of soft, smooth texture are comfortable, and they have the added advantage of not wrinkling easily. Firm, even weaves with no loose yarns are needed to withstand the wear of play and frequent launderings. However, durability must not be confused with weight. Often the lightweight materials wear just as well as the heavier ones and are much less tiring to a child. If the color of all washable fabrics used in children's clothing are fast to washing and to sunlight, they will look well as long as the garment is wearable. Colors should also be chosen for their attractiveness and suitability to a child's age, size, and personality. Gay colors are a protection to children under present-day traffic conditions. A child in a colorful garment is much more easily </seg>
         <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA" HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION seen by motorist than one in an outfit of somber color that blends into the roadway. The materials for children's garments should be so thoroughly shrunk as to insure the same fit after washing as before. ! • Since neither the possible shrinkage nor the colorfastness can be determined by looking at fabrics, only those that carry definite printed labels in regard to these qualities can be depended on to give satisfaction. .; :: ; -. ¦. ] _ In order, to be comfortable, every type of garment for a child, from the first slips to dresses, suits, and playsuits, must be properly cut and fitted. A little child is very active and needs clothes of -roomy design and with special features that allow the most extreme body movements. Such garments encourage play and look well when the child is either still or in action. Clothes that permit the freest movement also allow fo-r growth Certain adjustments, however, such as lengthening, cannot be avoid - • ed, and allowances for these can often be inconspicuously worked into the design. Closely related to comfort are conveniences that make dressing quick and easy. Babies often become fretful with too much handling Therefore clothes for infants a.nd very young children should have generous plackets, conveniently placed so that they can be fastened quickly. For the older child who is beginning to show a., interest in self-help, dressing features should be planned for his rather than for his mother's convenience. Clothes simple in design so that they cannot possibly be put on wrong, plackets in front, and fastenings easy to manage, encourage a child to develop self-reliance and skill. All clothes for children have to be well made to withstand the severe strain, hard wear, and frequent laundering that they are certain to get. To do this and at the same time to insure comfort, seams and finishes should be narrow, flat, smooth, and pliable. The kind of construction is determined by the particular garment, the material, and the kind of wear it will be given. In general, thread should always .match the fabric in strength and color. Stitching needs to be close and properly adjusted, and reinforcements are a protection for places likely to be strained. ¦;! ¦ Labels and tags of all sorts, some bearing information help - ful to the purchaser and some only for sales appeal, are attached to many ready-mades as well as to yard goods. </seg>
         <seg id="p390">UKI'ORT (IF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Of particular value are the labels giving definite and complete statements about colorfastness and shrinkage. For example, "color - fast to sun and washing" tells definitely what can be expected, as does "will not shrink more than 2 per cent". In contrast, terms such as "colorfast" or "preshrunk" leave room for question. Fab - rics so labeled are likely to be fast only to washing, and probably will shrink more when laundered. Tags often call attention to self-help features, but it is unwise to buy without first noting carefully their actual worth. Some are practical, and some are not. Also, because self-help is now consid - ered a good selling point and likely to be overemphasized, other features of more importance are in danger of being overlooked. Self - help clothes are not necessarily comfortable. A garment may be easy to put on and take off, yet most uncomfortable to wear. So in selecting patterns and ready-mades consider the points that count most for the child's good. Comfort comes first —after that, con - venience. Size labels are attached to all clothes for children. However, at present there is no standard or uniform system of sizing, nor are the dimensions based on any scientific study of body measurements. Three-year-olds may require garments labeled 6 or larger. Another reason for not relying entirely on size labels is that children of the same age may vary considerably in proportions. Then again, some ready-made clothing is skimped; that is, cut down in size and with very little seam allowance, so that the yardage may produce the greatest possible number of garments. The only safe way of de - termining correct size is to try on the clothes and check the fit of every part. Part 111 POUR-H CLUB WORK The Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture is in - terested in promoting the development of Four-H Club work in Ne - braska. Each year a part of the budget has been set aside for the purpose of stimulating interest in Home Economics Club activities. In 1938 the amount of seventy-five dollars was given to the State Four-H Club leader, M.r. L. I. Frisbie, for the promotion of Four-H activities. This money was used to help defray expenses of four Home Economics Four-H judging teams who participated in the National Judging Contests at the National Club Congress in Chicago, in November, 1938. This year the judging teams made unusually good records. </seg>

MY TRIP TO THE NATIONAL FOUR-H CLUB CONGRESS By Elsie Bamesberger Each year my 4-H work brings new experiences to .me and each of my experiences are more exciting. 4-H Camp was one of my first 4-H experiences. Club Week was still more interesting and brought more 4-H pep, but my trip to Chicago was the highlight of them all. On Saturday evening after a fine supper In the Union Depot in Omaha, we were "All aboard for Chicago" on the Rock Island Train. A train ride was a new experience for five of the fifty-three in the Nebraska delegation. Two Nebraskans had their first sight of Omaha. Three of the Nebraska delegation had been to Chicago and three had been on a pullman car before, but for the other fifty it. was a new as well as an interesting, experience, even though sev - eral of us did get trainsick on the train. The Nebraska delegation stayed in Hotel Harrison which is located two blocks west of Lake Michigan. The entire delegation of 1,200 stayed in four hotels which are quite close together. The place of meeting was in the Auditorium Hotel. .- '. Monday morning all the judging teams met to compete for the National Judging Contests. Since Yvonne Johnson and I were the highest ranking Foods Judging team of Nebraska, we were selected </seg>
         <seg id="p392">RKI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to compete for the National Contest, the donor of our trip being Miss Gill of the Omar Mills, the Home Economic Section of the Organized Agriculture, College of Agriculture at Lincoln, Perry Reed of the State Board of Agriculture, and the Farm Bureau at Aurora, Nebraska. Yvonne and I were one out of nineteen teams. We judged baking powder biscuits, white bread, menus for the main meal for a day in December, and informal table service. The team placing first was from Indiana. Yvonne and I placed sixth as a team, and sixteenth and ninth individually,. The "Hobby of the Week" was getting new and different sig - natures. We tried to get signatures of someone in every state rep - resented, as well as Canada, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. A forty-five mile tour of Chicago is a trip we 4-Hers enjoyed very much. Some of the important points of interest were: Negro town in which we saw the home of Joe Lewis, China town, Lincoln Park. Maxwell Street, the Chicago University and its chapel, Wash - ington Park, and Lake Shore Drive, in which we saw a beautiful sky - line of Chicago. Here you can easily see how tall the buildings of Chicago must be. We also passed over the Outer Drive Bridge which President Roosevelt dedicated last spring. Chicago now has the longest Lake Shore Drive in the world. Wilson day was another big day. We were entertained in the Medinah Temple with a most interesting program. We 4-Hers remember Mr. Wilson as one who gives many 4-H Scholorships, and is the head of a large Meat Packing Company in Chicago. On Monday night the entire group of 1,200 paraded in the arena Of the International Livestock Exposition, led by the lowa State band. Everyone wore their green hats with the name of their state on it, and some other identification mark. We Nebraskans wore red feathers in our hats, red and white Cornhusker gloves and "Ne - braska the White Spot" arm bands. Ten years pass in one morning.—That is, they did in the Plane - tarium as the planets which usually pass through the sky in one year, shot across it in less than three minutes. This .however, did not seem to effect our age, but we did forget where we were because it seemed so natural. We 4-Hers also visited the world's largest farm implement fac - tory, the McCormick Works. We went through the Machinery Line and the Twine Mill and ended up with a big banquet dinner. One of the last entertainments was the 4-H Dress Review which included 4 0 girls of 40 different states. They were divided into four groups. Comfortable Cottons for School or Sport, Warm Woolens for </seg>
         <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION School or Sport, That Best Dress, and To Keep Them Cutting In. These girls paraded in front of the King and Queen of Perfect Posture and their court. Then the best girl of each group was chosen. We girls were especially honored with a breakfast and a Style Review given for us by Jane Alden of the Chicago Mail Order. She showed us how to brighten up "Mary the Monotone" and make her look attractive with accessories of contrasting colors. She also showed us costumes suitable for almost every occasion needed. Our program was filled with many pleasant and new experiences. Things we hear about over the radio and read about in the papers are now more real to us and mean much more to us. At the end of the week we had a large collection of useful and interesting souvenirs given to us by the various companies that entertained us. We appreciate them and will always think of Chicago when we see or use them. ¦ The "Means of Travel" in Chicago was by taxi, double deck busses, elevated train, and electric train which were all new and thrilling means of travel for uj. Some other new things I learned about Chicago are: It is the world's healthiest large city. It has more small parks and playgrounds than any other city in the world. It has the world's biggest forest preserve system. It has the world's biggest plant manufacturing telephone apparatus and equipment. It sends and: receives more telegrams than any other city. It sells a greater variety of raw materials and manufactured goods than any other city in the world, it has the largest hotel in the world, and its Art Institute .has a larger membership than any other art school in the United States. Chicago has been a grand place for entertainment, but give me "Good old Nebraska" for its health arid cleanliness. </seg>

We are encouraged with the cooperation that your clubs are giving and we know that it is perhaps because you have a good topic with which to work namely you.r gardens. We feel that it is time well spent working with the various clubs of Nebraska and with the National Council. Mr. Hoppert is always willing to give his time and Professor Wiggans and his department are always happy to assist wherever they possibly can.

I am really very glad to be able to come back to Lincoln a second time. I must not have transgressed very far the first time or I wouldn't have been given the opportunity to return. The subject given me for today is "Garden Clubs Have Grown Up" and my talk will be brief because I Have talked personally to so many of you. Then I want to talk informally for a few minutes and give you a few suggestions and you may be able to give me some. Some of the points of my subject may have been touched on nujny times before so I hope you will bear with me. THE GROWTH OF THE GARDEN CLUBS We are now in the tenth year of the creation of the National Cojincil of State Garden Clubs. There have been" fpur presidents, ma. Frederick Kellogg, Mrs. Joel F. Swift, Mrs. Gross R. Scruggs of Texas, Mrs. O.W. Gynes of Chicago. Each one has developed in the Council a significant feature which has made the Council at this tenth adversary season an or - ganization well qualified to hold its own with organizations of much logger growth. The charter member states will always be proud that they were in at the beginning and as states entered and swelled the number, eac^i one was greeted with glad welcome. I can well remember when Nebraska was admitted through the efforts of Mr. Quinn of Kansas the Regional Vice President. </seg>
         <seg id="p398">KKI'ORT OF NKBUASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kansas was the first state in the Rocky Mountain Region, Colo - rado second, Nebraska third, Utah perhaps about the same time, and now we welcome Montana, whose membership was accepted in Hot Springs, Arkansas, last October. About five thousand garden club members belong to this region, but the number is increasing rapidly and with the keen awareness of our Western gardeners who realize the advantage of belonging to a National organization that has its roots in the Far East, we are rapidly finding projects that need cooperation behind them to put them across. We are holding up the offered projects of our sister states in the Bast and going them one better on their own projects. This is not mere optimism—it is farsightedness. What is more perfect location for judging schools, flower shows, forestry and conservation schools, than the campus of each Agricultural College? I am certain that the last Regional Convention of the Pacific Slope must have been a surprise to our Worthy National President, Mrs. Dynes, when they found that nearly six hundred people from the length and breadth, attended that meeting. The subject of Conservation is foremost in everybody's minds now and the National Conservation Chairman, Mrs. Kemble White, has struggled to save areas, beautiful with original girowth of trees and flowers, and vocal with bird song and alive with scurrying feet of little animals who have no place but these regions for their nomes. The destruction of these will cause the extinction of many species of birds, animals and flowers. Conservation means planting, as well as protecting. It means seeding vast, barren areas. It means wind-breaks and ground covers and care of wild life. We have awakened to the fact that Nature's beauty is not important to many people. "The tree that moves some to tears of joy Is, in the eyes of others, only a green thing That stands in the way. Some see nature all ridiculed and deformative And some scarcely see Nature at all. But to the eyes of a man of imagination. Nature is Imagination." Let our programs deal largely with Conservation. Many states have succeeded in having conservation taught in the public schools, which is as it should be. The Garden Clubs of Arkansas, through their president, Mrs. Carmack, have developed an entire study course in landscaping and conservation, flower nomenclature, which course have been adopted by the Arkansas schools. </seg>

John Taylore Arms and the New York Flower judging school started a serious study of art as applied to flower arrangement. It is a far cry from the tumbler of flowers Picked by our grandmothers and our mothers from the conglomerate mjss that, like a crazy quilt, spread before the front door of the home of the past, to the sophisticated "arrangement" that one often sees in the homes of earnest garden club members today. They have studied design and color and have even gone to Japan to take courses thtre at the feet of the masters. They have studied the old paintings of masters of art and torn the secrets from textbooks so that the things they bring to flower shows with their studied perfection are a joy. This they have gained through the enthusiasm they acquired whan they became members of the Garden Club. </seg>

What is the modest home doing about gardening and what effect have the garden clubs had upon the people in Rural America. That will be the real proof of the value of the Federation—that will be the New Frontier—the 4H Clubs are doing much to encourage garden study. The United States Department of Agriculture is at work —and let me suggest Rural Garden Clubs —and when these are active there will be plant - ing along the highways and beauty everywhere on the Country-side and they will be aided in this by our very efficient Koad side De - velopment Committee with Mrs. K.

Programs are in the hands of Mrs. Zur Craine who has super - vision over lectures and lantern slides. Mrs. Cram says "A growing cooperation exists between the garden clubs and the Horticultural and Botanical societies, State colleges and universities. To read of her program as outlined in the Bulletins of the National Council is nothing short of inspirational. Legislation is active with Resolutions and involve interest in the conservation, in polution of streams, and short courses in Horticul - ture and flower show judging classes in our colleges and universities and the study of conservation in the Public Schools.

Next come some pictures of shrub borders and individual shrubs suitable for Nebraska. Several of these shrubs are comparatively new to most of you here. One is the silver berry a shrub closely related to the Russian olive. Another is the native sinquefoi) of Wyoming known as potentilla fructicosa. Then come a few special garden features like pools, rock gardens, fireplaces and finally about 20 pictures of perennials grow - ing in the perennial border here on the campus. Just a word about the mechanics of the pictures. The scenes were all taken with a candid camera on color film 35 millimeters wide. The film is developed in Rochester and when it comes back the individual pictures are cut out and framed on a ca&gt;rd and then placed between two pieces of glass that are taped together. The total cost per slide is about 20 cents if you average 15 good pictures for each roll of film. If good technique is used in taking the pictures you will be gratified with the results. Each year you make changes in your garden. You could of course write up a detailed description of your garden at different seasons but a picture showing the flowers in their natural colors would be much better. Now lets have the lights off and will proceed with the pictures. MRS. GROUSEMAN: We will now see the slides which Mrs. Pish brought with her this morning. These pictures, I think, will show what we mean when we say there is a new and different trend in flower arrangement at flower shows. We are getting away from the milk bottle vases of the past. (Showing of slides) MRS. GROUSEMAN: Thank you, Mr. Hoppert, for the show - ing of your collection of pictures and the very interesting explanation of them. Thank you, too, Mrs. Fish, for your wonderful contribu - tion to our program through these slides. I am sure the members of the Garden Clubs would vote this a most valuable and useful part of the program. I might announce at this time that you may obtain a color chart for $1.00, through the National Council which will help you with your flower arrangements in your flower shows. There is another book which sells for more, $5.00 I believe, also available through the National Council of State Garden Clubs, which would be of great assistance in planning a flower show. Our next speaker is Mr. Frank Lancaster of Lincoln and he will talk to us on "Diseases of Ornamentals and Their Control". I once heard Mr. Bare of the Entomology Department say that unless we paid more attention to this phase as well as insect control, there would be no use to go on gardening. We are all anxious to hear what </seg>
         <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Mr. Lancaster has to tell us. Mr. Lancaster. _ MB. LANCASTER: A true gardener has plenty of love In his Heart for growing plants and spends much time, money and effort to have his garden growing In the manner in which he wants it. He fertilizes it, and, quite often, he doesn't know what he is using or what it Is for. He will hoe his garden meticulously because he knows that the weeds will choke out his plants but there are lots of weeds in iis garden that he doesn't see or even knows exists. When he^ee 8 an unhealthy appearance of plants, he knows his plants are stek and generally will pull up the affected ones. Possibly/he treats them in some manner in which he has treated other plants but they ™?1 ?,° *% f BP°nd t0 thiß treatment- to the brief time at my dis - posal it will be impossible to go into great detail on any individual disease but I will try to outline the different types of diseases and general recommendations for their control. Diseases of Ornamental Plants and Their Control F. R. Lancaster ; . The causes of infectious plant diseases are classified as Fungi, I Bacteria and Viruses./ Fungi and Bacteria might be called the in - visible weeds of the garden since they are unwanted plants. For the time being let us just say that Viruses are animated chemicals which have no body structure but have the power of reproducing themselves. I have referred to the bacteria and fungi as plants, which indeed mey are but they contain no chlorophyll and, therefore, cannot j manufacture their own food but must derive it from material already manufactured by plants. This food-getting disturbs the normal pro - cesses of the Plant and often results in injury or death of the host. Fungi commonly propagate themselves by spores which are seed- Wke organs similar In function to the seeds of higher plants. These Spores are top small to be seen by the naked eye and are easily blown and splashed about by wind and rain. When a spore lands on 4 susceptible; plant it will germinate if there is plenty of moisture i bout. During rainy periods fungi propagate themseves rapidly A spore germinates .much as does a seed; a thread-like process grows cut, enters an opening in the host plant and ramifies throughout the ijlant tissues. There is wide variation among fungi In the size and shape of the organs which bear spores. Many spore-bearing organs Of disease-causing fungi appear as small black pimple-like bodies ijnbedded in the plant tissue. The common mushroom is a spore - j bjearlng organ of a fungus which does not cause disease but lives in soil. Jt has been calculated that If the spores in a common mush- </seg>
         <seg id="p404">KKI'ORT OF XKBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE room were laid end to end they would extend some 40 miles, yet each one is invisible to the naked eye. In many cases the ravages of these organisms can be prevented. The principles of control of these parasites which we will consider are: Exclusion, Eradication, Protection and Resistance. Exclusion has to do with keeping the parasites out of the garden. Spores are constantly being blown about and carried by insects.^ This makes it a very difficult job for the gardener to practice exclusion methods. He can plant disease-free stock, however. It is well to look over all new plant material carefully. Always husk Tulip bulbs in the fall just before planting. Discard those which have brown streaks in the white bulb scales. They are probably infected with the disease called Fire". If Gladiolus conns have any discolored pitting or decayed areas, they probably have any of a number of fungous diseases and should be destroyed. In other words, don't plant any material which is stunted or spotted or otherwise malappearing. Quarantines are another form of exclusion. They are established by Federal or state authority in order to prohibit the shipment of plant material which might harbor disease organisms or insects. In - fectious diseases and injurious insects may have little importance in their native countries because other biological factors enter in .to establish the so-called balance of nature. When these disease or - ganisms get into localities where the natural control factors are not established, their spreading is unimpeded and rapid. Quarantines then, are set up to prohibit the importation of plants which might carry diseases or insects which would cause trouble in this country. Quarantines are likewise set up around areas where trouble has started as an attempt to impede its progress. In one year more than 17,500 insects and more than 7,500 diseases were intercepted at points of entry. Eradication must be conscientiously practiced by all gardeners. Dead and diseased wood should be kept pruned out and burned. Annuals and perennials which are severely diseased should be dug out and discarded. Infected material should under no circumstances be used as a mulch or composted. Under these conditions the para - sites will produce their spores prolifically and infect other plants in the garden. Always promptly destroy diseased material which has been removed from the garden. Many people believe that when a number of different plants in the garden are unhealthy, they all have the same disease. This is seldom the case even though the symptoms may be quite similar. Powdery Mildew is an exception in that it is a disease which has a very wide host range from trees to herbaceous plants and is an ex- </seg>
         <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY 401 ample of one which often affects many plants in the garden at one time. | Damping-off is another example of a disease which has a wide host range. Destruction of seedlings of all types and basal rotting |of cuttings is caused by a group of soil inhabiting fungi present in a very wide number of soils. Everyone who starts his own seeds should take precautions in guarding against this trouble. Control of tree diseases generally comes under the principle of Eradication. There is a wilt disease of American Elm which we have in Nebraska. The fungus parasite lodges itself in the water - conducting vessels of the host and the branches die back. So far the only satisfactory control for this and many tree diseases is to prune out the infected portions well back into the health area. In cutting! to the trunk or mother branch it is important to make a clean cut very close toor flush with the supporting member. A callous (can then quickly grow over the wound whereas when a stub is left,'healing does either not take place at all or it takes place more slowly. This makes conditions favorable for &gt;ot organisms to enter and the stub will rot back until there is a cavity. The judiciousj use of a wound paint is advisable on the larger cuts. Eradication is the only satisfactory control principle in com - bating virous diseases. Aster yellows, Lily mosaic and Tulip break - ing are Outstanding examples of virous diseases. It is well to rogue out all plants which have leaves containing an indefinite mottling or yellow blotching, as from the absence of chlorophyll, or are stunted 6r contain deformed flowers with combinations and modifi - cations of these, since there is a good likelyhood that they are In - fected with a virus. The (most widely practiced control principle is Protection in the use of sprays and dusts. A film.'-of residue of the spray or dust is laid down on the plant surfaces. When a disease spore lands on this surface and germinates the germ tube is killed by the toxic chemical present. Since spores germinate readily under conditions of rain or high humidity, it can be understood that the protecting chemicals should be applied before these weather conditions set In. Bordeaux Mixture is one of the best and oldest of spray .materials. There is an interesting story behind it. French grape growers of Bordeaux back around 1880 had so much trouble with thieves that ;hey contrived to use a poison on the road-side vines to keep away narauders. Copper sulphate or blue vitriol was mixed with some Ime and splashed on the plants. The residue appeared formidable md did its work in more than one way. Millardet, a French path - ologist, noted that the covered vines suffered less from mildew. He </seg>
         <seg id="p406">HKI'OKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE developed the use of this combination for controlling this grape disease and it has since come into wide use. Bordeaux Mixture is principally used for the control of leaf diseases. At the rate of 4-4-50 it is recommended for leaf spots of Hollyhock and Ivy in connection with the removal and destruction of diseased parts and debris. The same consideration applies to the die-back ol Lilac branches, and Peony leaf spots. There are other copper fungicides on the market which have been developed primarily to lessen the injury produced by Bordeaux Mixture in certain cases. Some are improvements from the stand - point of physical qualifications. In addition to copper fungicides, sulphur sprays and dusts are particularly adapted for use in the garden. Frequent dustings with sulphur will successfully control the mildews to which we referred before. Hollyhock rust which can be distinguished by the orange - brown scab-like masses under the leaves, la readily held in check by dusting sulphur as are a number of rusts. Certain rose diseases are readily controlled by the application of sulphur in connection with the cutting back of the canes to 3 or 4 buds in the spring and clean cultivation. It is not necessary to dust heavily. Frequent light applications are more effective. Alany fungi live in the soil and when the opportunity presents itself attack the underground parts of plants. Some of these soil fungi ball up to form a little brown resting body about the size of a pea and smaller which we call a sclerotium. A fungus of this nature causes root and crown rots of a number of plants including Delphinium, Plantain Lily, Penstemon, Valarln, Pyrethreum and German Iris. It is probably parasitic on a number of annuals and perennials. In control, diseased plants must be eradicated and the soil drenched with a solution of corrosive sublimate 1-2000. Where very severe it is well to plant a new crop in another location. Peony Blight is caused by a fungus which can live in the soil and is very common in Nebraska. In the spring, young shoots may rot at the base and fall over. When attacked later in the season, buds turn black and cease to develop. The stalk below a bud is usually decayed for a short distance and the leaves develop large irregular dark brown areas. Where severe trouble has been experienced, it is well to remove the top 2 or 3 inches of soil and replace with a mixture of clean sand and soil. All infected parts should be removed and the soil lightly sprinkled with corrosive sublimate 1-2000. The damping-off or sudden death of seedlings is caused by a number of soil-inhabiting fungi.

LANCASTER: That particular fungus is prevalent this year. We have had many more plants with such fungus sent in for diagnosis this year than in former years. By the way, we have a service here at the University with which many of you may not be familiar. Diseased plants may be sent here and a diagnosis of them made without charge. I would suggest, if you have diseased plants, that you wrap them in waxed paper, after slightly moistening them, then wrap them again in ordinary wrappings and mail them to the University. In the case of leaf wilts or entire browning of leaves, try to send the entire plant, if possible. MRS. FISH: You spoke of burning leaves and branches trim - med from shrubs as means of control of plant diseases. Gardeners have been stressing the point of conserving such material because of its value to the soil. MR. LANCASTER: It is true that there is a value in thia material but, on the whole, I would consider it a better practice to burn the leaves because we don't know whether or not they have disease. MRS. FISH: Could we discriminate in some way? Tree leaves seem so clean. Those parts of plants which have been cut away might be burned but the tree leaves saved. MR. LANCASTER: Rather than take a chance on introducing disease through the compost or mulch, I would rather buy a com - mercial fertilizer. MRS. GROUSEMAN: Thank you, Mr. Lancaster. Your dis - cussion and your answers to some of our questions have no doubt cleared up some of the questions in the minds of our Garden Club members.

The available water—ls% of the dry weight of the soil—under the conditions above amounts to 2-2% inches per foot of soil depth. Thus a soil five feet deep will hold, for plant use, the equivalent of 10-12 inches of water. The amount of water required by plants depends upon many factors. Some plants need water in great abundance and others only sparingly as evidenced by our acquatic and desert species—and there are all gradations between these extremes. Relative humidity and temperatures are also very Important since on a dry, hot day needs are much greater than under contrasting conditions. Air move - ment likewise influences evaporation from leaf surfaces. The preceding discussion based largely upon simple plant phy - siology and soil principles, has been given as a background for a general consideration of the water problem faced by the ornamental grower. Ornamental plants are no different in their demands for soil moisture than similar plants used for other purposes. Water requirement studies have been made with some agronomic plants and to indicate what their needs are the following table is submmftted. The data are taken from an article written by M. D. Weldon and published in the Nebraska State Horticultural Society report for two years ago. Moisture Requirements of Various Agronomic Crops Water re- Production quired per per acre Water re- Rainfall Cr °P lb. dry dry quired per equivalent ¦matter matter acre lbs! tons tons Inches Corn 317 2.5 792 7.0 Wheat 475 2.0 950 8.4 Sweet Clover 700 2.5 1750 13.6 Alfalfa 900 3.5 3150 27.8 Work with large sized woody plants is naturally much more difficult and hence but little has been done. In California, however, it has been estimated than an orange grove (100 trees) produces 4 0 lbs. dry matter per tree per year with a water requirement of 500 to 1. The water usage would then be 1000 T or 9.0 inches. This figure is very comparable to those given for wheat. During the past several years some of the Nebraska investiga - tors have been interested in measuring the water usage in mature apple orchards. Indications are that the water required under our </seg>

It is a well known fact that Wuegrass has the </seg>
         <seg id="p412">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE main share of its rootsystem in the upper foot of soil with relatively few roots penetrating beyond the second foot. Most of the annuals and perennials root deeper but few of their roots reach more than 6-8 feet deep. On the other hand woody plants and trees in particular often reach unexpected depths under good soil conditions. For instance it has been found that a three-year-old apple tree may have roots lti feet deep and with a spread of 10 feet on either side of the tree. A 17-year-old Jonathan apple had many roots reaching to an im - penetrable shale layer 33-35 feet deep and the spread covered a space greater than 30x33 feet. Thirty-yeair-old pines in the wind - break surrounding the Station orchard had roots reaching a sandy layer thirty feet deep and extending laterally for forty feet or more from the tree. Depth and spread of the root system naturally will have great influence upon how often and how copiously water will need to be applied in the absence of rain. Shallow rooted species, such as grass, will need frequent watering but moderate applications will be more economical than heavy ones since none of the water should percolate beyond the root zone. Even here, however, the tendency of the average householder is to water entirely too sparingly. Re - membering that one gallon of water makes an application of one inch over 1.6 square feet, than over 1500 gallons is required to give a similar application to a front yard of 50x50 feet. Such an amount will soak up only about six inches of dry soil. If one is to thoroughly soak up the upper two feet of such a soil then 5000-6000 gallons of water is required. Before this amount has been applied the house - holder is likely to begin to think of his water bill and then act by shutting off the hose. Such an amount of course, seldom will need be applied at one time since the soil is never likely to be dried en - tirely to the wilting- point. The point to be made, however, is that even when one feels that large amounts of water are being applied, the a.mount after all may be rather insignificant in comparison with a good rain. In the cases of more deeply rooted species proportionately great - er amounts of water will be needed if the lower levels in the soil are to have the depleted reserves entirely restored. In one test at the University Fruit Farm at Union 43 inches of water were required to restore the moisture which had been removed from the upper 30 feet of soil by a developing orchard. Of course total restoration is not necessary since available water anywhere within the root zone can be used by the plant. However, it does indicate that the problem of replacing the water for our street and park trees and for dead or dying orchard and windbreak plantings is not a simple one. </seg>

However, since this seems to be the size of our crowd, we will start right out with our program. We arranged this year to have quite a bit of time for round table dis - cussion of problems and quite a lot of time will be devoted to that. It doesn't make any difference what your problem is or what you are interested in, we want you to come back this afternoon and take part in these discussions. We hope to have someone here who will help to answer your questions. We can all benefit from this kind of meeting if all will participate. At this time, we will have a talk by Orville Marquardt on "Growing and Canning Vegetables for ou.r State Institutions". Mr. Marquardt is with the State Board of Control at Genoa. Mr! Marquardt. GROWLXG AXD CAXXIXG VPJGKTABLES AT STATE INSTITUTIONS The Genoa State Farm is the youngest of the eighteen state institutions under the supervision of the Board of Control. The grounds and buildings were formerly the Genoa Indian School and when the Federal Government decided to abandon this school, they deeded the property to the state. The Legislature of 1937 turned the grounds and buildings over to the Board of Control, designated the institution as the Genoa State Farm and authorized the transfer of inmates from the State Pennitentiary and the Reformatory for men to this institution. Plans were commenced in the fail for the fields and garden crops. Fields or plots of ground, called projects were, established tor the different crops to be raised. The ground was surveyed, bounderies determined, and the nature of the soil, contour of the land, whether it could be irrigated or not, and rotation of crops were determining factors in deciding what crop would be planted on each project. The garden crops consisted of: Sweet corn tomatoes </seg>

         <seg id="p416">KKPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The early cabbage was planted in shallow furrows, in rows 3.5 feet apart, plants I. 5 feet apart. As soon as the plants were in, a light irrigation was applied. With this method we had a 95% sur - vival in the field. All the cultivation was done by a disc cultivator, gradually filling up the furrows. We followed the California system in planting tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and late cabbage. By the California system, I mean we opened up furrows with a lister and then the day before we planted, we ran water down these furrows. To help protect the tomatoes from the hot winds, we planted four rows of tomatoes and four rows of sweet corn. In planting, each man had one job. Some men made the holes, some dropped the plants and others set the plants in the ground. Following the planting, we put on another light irrigation. A go-devil was used the first two times to cultivate. A tractor cultivator was used after that on the corn and a single row, five point plow was used on the tomatoes. Like most of the other counties in Nebraska, Nance has suffered severly from the lack of precipitation. A total of 19.28 inches of moisture fell this year with 8.50 inches prior the gTowing season and 11.37 inches during the growing season, 11.28 inches precipi - tation fell the previous year. The average for the last three years is 10.84 inches. With a moisture problem as this, a great deal of time and labor was spent on prepairing the ground so it might be irrigated. Beaver Creek furnished the water for irrigation. An eight inch pump and a Farmall tractor was used to pump the water to the highest point and from there it was carried to the separate projects in smaller canals and laterals. Only a small portion of the ground was in condition for irrigation, so we tried to arrange the crops that needed the most water, and those that would bring in the most revenue, on plots that we could irrigate. Due to the short - age of help, we were unable to run as much water as was needed. Since almost all of the other crops were nearly a total failure, we can credit our small irrigation system to a .major part of our pro - duction. Chart A gives a comparison of the cost of producing five major crops. This incudes the cost of seeds or plants, preparation of ground and planting, cultivation, harvesting, trucking, cost of can - ning, inmate labor, unit cost and number of cans received per unit. $2000 may sound like it is quite a sum, but when that is all you have to start a cannery, it takes some pretty good scheming </seg>

         <seg id="p420">RKI'OHT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE encountered during the last five years have been due to very hot and dry weather at blooming time. At high temperatures (85° to 90c f. and higher; the vital functions of the flowers are so dis - turbed that fruit setting does not occur. One of the most common things that happens is the rapid growth of the style, causing it to carry the stigma beyond the stamens before they are capable o£ shed - ding pollen. As tomatoes are generally self fertilized, this becomes a very serious matter in that little or no pollen gets to the stigma and it soon dries up and dies. Even though pollen may reach such a stigma the pollen is frequently sterile because of high temperature or it is incapable of developing a sufficiently vigorous pollen tube to survive the adverse conditions of heat and low humidity to which it is exyosed. As a consequence the flowers remain unfertilized and fruit does not set. Although all the consequences of these climatic conditions can - not be avoided, observations and tests during the recent severe sum - mers provide foundation for the conviction that a few things can be done that will increase the chances of producing a crop. First or all adequate moisture must be supplied. Straw mulching has helped considerably, but in most years and places some irrigation has been needed. Plantings on northerly slopes, while they came into fruit later, produced more fruit than those on south slopes or on level land, where plants were often entirely barren. Wind protection of almost any kind was beneficial; the plantings immediately north of proves, windbreaks, or buildings almost always produced some fruit when plants in unprotected areas were barren. Planting strips of six or more rows of corn between strips of 6 to 8 rows of tomatoes was found to be beneficial. By using good strong plants and forc - ing the growth early in the season some early fruit setting can be accomplished, that is, by late June or before the hottest weather of the year in middle or late July. At least that part of a crop is thus secured. The use of large, well-grown plants, transplanting at least some of the ulants quite early, and the use of varieties that bloom very early and quite abundantly, have all been of some service in securing tomatoes in each of these unfavorable seasons. In the western part of the state the matter of excessive heat during blooming ti.me has not been a serious problem, fruit having set quite freely and continally during each of the recent hot summers. In this western district the serious factors are cold weather in late spring, which retards the growth of the plants, and early fall frosts which often reduce the crop very severely. In the dry-land regions the shortage of water is of course always a serious matter, but that </seg>
         <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY 417 difficulty may be avoided by providing water to at least part of the garden. These difficulties, which frequently apply in central and northeastern Nebraska and once in a while in southeastern Nebraska, can be avoided to a degree by the use of better plants, provisions of windbreaks, the use of south slopes, and the use of varieties that will produce fruit under these conditions. In the southeastern part of the state wilt has occurred more or less spasmodically. Probably most of it is the result of using in - fected southern plants, but some' observations indicate that the causal organism may be living over in the soil. This situation will become more common as tomatoes are grown more. If that is the case, wilt-resistant varieties deserve consideration. In years of fairly abundant rainfall and .moderate temperature in the eastern part of the state, varieties that do well on hills and . uplands may produce excessively big vines |and relatively little fruit on the river bottoms. If rainfall is excessive and temperatures are low, vine growth may be very rank and fruit setting will be light. This situation seldom occurs and need not be considered a major factor in selecting a variety.' ; ¦ '¦¦.¦ During the last few years plant breeders have produced a num - ber of new varieties for the purpose of rendering tomato production less hazardous in various parts of the country and also to supply varieties of superior quality. Most of these new varieties have been tested in Nebraska as they have been introduced during the last fif - teen years. Not only have some of these varieties been subjected to |. tests at.Lincoln during a great variety of summers but many of them I have also been tested at Nebraska City, North Platte, and Scotts - bluff. At the two latter places temperatures are always appreciably lower than at Lincoln. It will not be possible to consider all of the varieties tested, so this discussion will be confined to the var - | ieties that seem most promising. for certain purposes, with a word of | warning here and there about some of the newer varieties in which ' some serious limitations may have been discovered. First Group: Earliest Varities2 For years the Earliana was considered the best early variety, I but now we have a number of. varieties that are earlier and that may have more desirable fruits. ¦ These very early varieties are very .1 important for the production of the main crop in the cooler high - altitude areas, and for producing early tomatoeß in eastern Nebraska or producing some fruit-in hot weather when others fall. The first early varieties tested were Farthest North, Bison, Red River, Alacrity, ) Abel, and Early Avon. The earliest of all varieties observed by </seg>

Schermerhorn, Classification of Tomato Varieties According to Physiological Response. Proc American Society for Horticultural Science Vol. 31): 737-739 1038. Since this paper was written (November )!):«) Tiedjens and Schermerhorn of New Jersey presented a paper in which they classify tomato varieties in almost identically the same groups as are suggested in this paper. The characteristics of the two extreme classes set forth by them are stated as follows: "1 Varieties which are highly floriferous and fruitful with a relatively small amount of foliage and which require a high level of fertility and a favorable environment. "2. Varieties which are highly vegetative, distinctly less floriferous and which are easily induced to become unfruitful with optimum conditions for growth." In the first group they list the variey Perm State, a small determinate-type, heavy-setting variety. In the last group they place Rutgers, a strong-growing late variety. They placed Earliana in the second early group, Pritchard and Bonny Best in the third or midseason group, and Marglobe in the fourth or medium-to-late group. They report that in warm soils (800 F.) the varieties of the first grout) have shown a slow rate of metabolism and consequently grew and fruited well, whereas the varieties of the last group had a rapid rate of metabolism and used up reserve food material rapidly at high temperatures and were con - sequently unfruitful. But at low soil temperatures «150 F.) these varieties fruited very well. The Bison is a large, smooth, red-fruited variety with small so - called "determinate"-type vines. It was originated by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. In practically all our tests it has been the most dependable first early variety. If provided with adequate fertility and moisture it has continued to produce fruit quite constantly throughout the hot summers and has proved capable of setting fruit during an interval of a few favorable days in hot sum - mer when other varieties failed to set fruit. Because of its propen - sity to produce small vines and to set a very large number of fruits, it should be provided with abundant fertility and moisture. It seems impossible to cause this variety to become so vegetative that it will not produce fruit. In fact, if it is to produce a .maximum crop of fruit the vine growth must be forced as much as possible. The only serious fruit defect observed has been a tendency toward dark </seg>

         <seg id="p426">REF'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE •\orth JDuliota 215, from the North Dakota Experiment Station, is unique in producing- large, pink, meaty, slightly flattened fruits on determinate but strong plants. This variety was named Ruby by the originators in 1938. Although fruit is set quite early it does not mature as early as that of the earliest group—probably because of the large size. Many of the fruits are very smooth and of desirable market type but some are rough with deep corrugations. Generally 4 oc-- or more of the fruit was of good fresh market type and prac - tically all other fruit was usable for canning or juice, as the color was invariably very good and uniform. The percentage of prime fruit was greatest in the cooler western regions. The total produc - tion was generally greater than with Bison because of the slightly larger vine and the ability to better survive hot weather, thus pro - ducing a larger late crop of fruit. The fruits turn whitish green before ripening and probably this results in lower temperature in the fruit and accounts for the fact that very little sunburning occurs even when fruit is exposed to very intense sunlight. The adaptation and limitation of this variety are essentially the same as for Bison. North Dakota 209 is a very heavy setting, early, determinate variety producing deep round red fruits (named Red Heart by the originators in 1938). It produces more early fruit and sets a greater total number of fruits than does Ruby. The color is not so desirable as it might be, there being streaks of orange color radiating from the apical end. A relatively high percentage of the fruits are mar - ketable. Under some conditions the fruit has had a pronounced acid taste which was objected to very much by some people but was not considered undesirable by others. All lied is a newly named variety from North Dakota which had been sent out for trial purposes under the number, N. D. 216. As the name indicates, the fruit ripens uniformly to a good red color. This variety has been relatively more satisfactory in the western than in the eastern part of the state, although in 1938 it was very satis - factory at all trial points. The adaptability and cultural require - ments are essentially the same as for Bison. Lincoln, Millets Dakota, and SchelVs No. 10 are all fairly good red standard-vined varieties of this group. They were quite productive at all places but are likely to have rough or small fruit. The have no superior merit in comparison with some of the earlier or slightly later varieties. Progress is a small-vined, very early introduction from North Dakota. It is not recommended because of the high percentage of rough fruits. </seg>

         <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Break O'Daj- was developed by the U.S.D.A. Division o£ Fruit and Vegetable Crops from a cross between Marglobe and Marvana and was introduced in 1931. It is a standard-vined variety, pro - ducing quite uniform globular red smooth fruit. The first fruits are quite large and smooth. It may not be quite as early as Earliana but produces smoother fruit. It sets a few fruits on each cluster and all fruits on a cluster are quite uniform. Because of the long internodes the vine growth is very open and sunburning of fruit is serious. Fruit cracking has been a serious defect as has been the poor color of ripe fruit in hot weather. This variety is favored for its fine, large, early fruits and high production and considerable resistance to wilt, leaf spot, and blossom end rot, but not desirable because of sunburn, cracking ot fruit, and poor fruit color in hot weather. As the vine growth is not especially vigorous, dry or infer - tile soils should be avoided. In many instances the slightly later Pritchard may be more desirable. The performance of Break O'Day has been rather fickle and not always understandable. Mascot—a round, red, medium-to-small-fruited, standard-vined type that sets fruit quite well in hot weather —deserves further con - sideration in the central and western part of the state. Bestal, Lightning, Lincoln, and Speed all produce rather small smooth fruits in abundance even under rather adverse conditions and the total yield may be quite great. Considering the merits of many other varieties, these should not be used extensively without care - ful study. Penii State, a determinate, fairly small-vined variety, produc - ing good quality round deep red fruit, is not quite as early as Earliana. It is an introduction of the Pennsylvania State College, coming from a cross between Perm State Earliana and Cooper's Special (Self Pruning). Fruits are less susceptible to concentric cracks than those of Earliana. It is not recommended at Lincoln because of the tendency to produce a large number of deep-seated corky spots on the skin during hot dry weather. In 1936 this was so common as to interfere seriously with the marketing of the crop. At North Platte the tendency was less pronounced and at Scottsbluff it was not serious. In 1937 and 1938 It was less common at Lincoln. It is worth further trial iv the cool parts of the state. Because of their small size, plants may be set as close as 3x3 or 3x4 feet. Early Paris Market produces fruit of intensely red color of about the season of Earliana. The fruit is of good shape, fairly uniform, and of very good flavor but is entirely too soft for market use. </seg>
         <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Fourth Group: Midseason Varieties Iv the fourth group of varieties we have what are commonly considered midseason varieties. Tlie varieties of this group are about the latest that should be considered in the,western part of the state. During most years they have ' more or less satisfactory but during the last few hot years most varieties in this group have not done well at Lincoln. These varieties must be treated cautiously as to moisture and fertility or they may become excessively vegetative and unfruitful. At all places in ihe state they should constitute a portion of the crop because of ttiejgbod fruit characteristics. Bonny Best, John Baer, and Chalk's Jewel are very similar. They produce large red, fairly smoth fruits on medium to large j vines. The Bonny Best and John Baer are both selections from !.Chalk's Jewel. At one time they appeared to have rounder, earlier fruit but stocks now seem so badly confused that no distinct differ - ences are detectable. Circular growth cracks are almost unknown on the fruits but radial cracks are' common. They seem to be the most susceptible of all varieties to blossom end rot but not quite as susceptible to sunburning as are some varieties of this group. These varieties have given very satisfactory yields at Lincoln and North Platte in many seasons, but at Scottsbluff yields were only fair unless the season extended beyond the average early fall frost date. In seasons warmer than usual they did well at Scotts - bluff. In the; hot season they were very unproductive at Lincoln because of poor fruit setting. In the North Platte Valley they can be expected to yield well in most seasons on the gravelly sandy south slopes, but their use on the fertile, flat or northern slopes is haz - ardous. The Nystate is similar to the John Baer but the frutt seems to be more uniform. . ¦ -.'.'¦ The PrJtchard was developed by the U.S.D.A. from a cross be - tween Marglobe and Cooper's Special (Self Pruning) and was orig - inally introduced as Scarlet Topper in 1931 but was renamed Pritch - ard in 1932 in honor of the originator, Pritchard, an alumnus of the University of Nebraska. The plantslare generally smaller than those of Bonny Best, being almost determinate. The leaves are very large, so that the growth is very dense. The fruits are round, red, medium to large, and are set later than Break O'Day and Bonny Best but earlier than Marglobe. Fruits are smaller than are Break O'Day but of more attractive color and, because of the dense foliage, less likely to be sunburned. It is j resistant to fusarium wilt and mllhead rust. It requires a rich soil for best development. </seg>
         <seg id="p430">JiEi'OKT OF XKBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Early ISaltimore has not been tested extensively in this state. However, it has given consistently good results in Illinois, coming into production there with Pritchard and also being wilt resistant, but here it has been much later than Pritchard. Landreth and Clark's Special A appeared to belong to this group. but the crop from these varieties has not been satisfactory. l-'ifth Group: Late Varieties Iv the fifth or late group of tomatoes are listed most of the late varieties that are commonly grown for the late fresh market and for canning in the extensive commercial tomato sections. Most of these varieties are not suited to the western part of the state because of the cooler climate and shorter seasons. In many years they are reasonably satisfactory in the central part of the state. Frequently they are very disappointing in the eastern part of the state because of their inability to set fruit in hot weather. In all parts of the state it is necessary to avoid excessive fertility and to guard against watering too freely or plants will become very vegetative and un - fruitful. The varieties considered in this group are Marglobe, Rut - gers, Glovel, Grothen, Globe, Early Stone, Stokesdale, and Cooper's Special. Marglobe produces uniform round red fruits of good size, some - what later than Pritchard. It resulted from a cross between Marvel and Giobe and was introduced by the U.S.D.A. in 1927 because oi its wilt resistance. It is medium-late to late. The foliage is com - pact, thus providing protection against sunscald. A serious defect is the formation of 4 or 5 deep radial cracks about Vk t« 1 inch long at the basal end. Fruits are larger than those of Pritchard. Of the late varieties it is perhaps the only one that can be safely used on the rich river-bottom soils in the eastern part of the si.s.te. In the North Platte Valley it may give satisfactory crops on warm gravelly slopes but not much should be expected of it in most seasons on the rich flat soils. This variety was very unsatisfactory at Lincoln dur - ing the hot summers. Rutgers is a selection from a cross between Marglobe and J.T.D. and was developed in New Jersey. It is generally reported as having deeper interior color than Marglobe. Its performance in Nebraska has been less satisfactory than that of Marglobe. The other varieties listed in this group produce fruits of very good quality but they are of limited value in Nebraska. In some of the seasons they will do fairly well in the southeastern or central </seg>

They are too late for all but the very exceptional seasons in the North Platte Valley. Up to the present time our tests of Scarlet Dawn have shown I it to be a very well colored, globular, red-fruited variety but certainly not an early varitey and seldom up to average productivity. Stokes - dale would also classify as a late red with very good fruit but setting | rather poorly. Marhio, Glovel, JGrothen, Cardinal, Valiant, and i Clark's Special B&amp; C all produced; some fruit very early and a few fruits at each picking all season but they never "came into heavy production at Lincoln or North Platte and at Scottsbluff they were too late. . 1 j Sixth Group: ..Very Late Varieties This group of varieties comprises very late, large vined, and generally the large-fruited varieties, such as Stone, Enormous, Pon - derosa, Marvelosa, Indlana~Baltlmore &gt; Hummer, etci The fruits of these varieties have very desirable-characteristics but they are gen - erally much too late for most parts, of the state and seem incapable of setting fruit in hot weather.

What varieties would you recommend? DR. WERNER: If you have very rich soil and have water avail - able, use types that have limited ( vine growth. Under these same conditions, other varieties may beqome so vegetative that they are hard to handle or may not produce fruit. QUESTION: What about the use of a mulch? DR. WERNER: Mulch restricts vegetative growth, but should be used with care. On the strong growing varieties, there is not much danger but with weaker growing varieties, you may cut down production by too heavy a mulch. , .!'• MR.

         <seg id="p434">RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE DR. WERNER: We used phosphate but got no response at all. Some soils need nitrogen. If manure is used, nothing else is neces - sary. MR. MARQUARDT: How does the Bison stand when shipped by truck? DR. WERNER: I think it would hold up as well as the Earliana. MEMBER: I have found it holds up even better. MR. BELL: Is this North Dakota No. 215 variety the small vine type? DR. WERNER: All North Dakota varieties are determinate vines. You can get high yields by planting close together, 2%' to 3' in the row instead of 4. MR. HANKINS: What was your experience with rot on the pink varieties? DR. WERNER: Our figures do not show any higher percent - age of rot than with other varieties. MR. HANKINS: I noticed at Scottsbluff where the tomatoes were in contact with the soil that nearly every tomato was rotted. DR. WERNER: There was an irrigation ditch on each side of the vines and this was supposed to be filled up gradually by cul - tivation. The first clusters of fruit got into this small ditch and the wet weather plus irrigation gave us a lot of rot. I think that could have been avoided if it had not been for the unusual situation I mentioned. MR. HANKINS: I think Dr. Werner is too modest about his own tomato growing. He hasn't told us much about it. DR. WERNER: We have a cross that looks promising. It has medium sized fruit of good quality color and flavor and yields even better than does Bison. One of the plants had 30 pounds of tomatoes on it at one time. Of course, that was an extraordinary circum - stance. I wouldn't expect every plant to do the same. MR.

         <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY In several counties in Nebraska, we have canning factories and in several counties there is quite alot of commercial vegetable work being done. I have this project in .mind particularly for counties where there are canning factories, j We haven't had any clubs until this year growing vegetable crops, and in Custer county the grass - hoppers destroyed the gardens so: that the tomato club folks lost their plants. , ! These special crops offer the \ best opportunity for 4-H work. They would appeal most to the members from 14 to 20 years of age. They offer work with plants, work out of doors, and give a ready cash crop. So many 4-H projects fall down on the returns to club members. &gt; J . We have attempted to prepare material to be used by these club members. We have taken tils up with the canning factory officials and they are interested ik promoting this kind of work.

Some of these growers have offered to lead and help in any way possible. Vegetable growing isn't as spectacular as some of the other club work.

         <seg id="p436">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. ROBERTS (Lincoln): I had a question I would like to ask. Last spring the early carrots gave lots of trouble because they wouldn't stand up on the market. Then I had another batch planted the first of June which came on late, about September Ist, and they were perfectly good. It was the same variety of carrots, In fact was the same batch of seed. Can you tell me why the later ones were better? It seems like ouv early carrots never can compete with California carrots. DR. WERNER: I do not know that I can tell you the cause of this but we have been analyzing carrots for several summers. The relation of the proportion of the core to the outer part of the carrot is very much greater in our carrots as we grow them in the summer time than is the case with the California carrots. We have a ratio with the Danvers of about 2 to 1. Some varieties run up to 3% or 4 to 1. These same varieties coming in from California run ratios of 6 or 7 to 1. When we grow carrots in the fall, that same relationship .holds. In the fall, when less moisture is necessary, the percentage of core decreases. In all varieties, the percentage of sugar in the core is very much less than it is in the outer portion and it is not a sweet sugar. This other sugar that is manufactured in plants and occurs in the cores of carrots is reducing sugar that has only about 60% of the sweetness and flavor of ordinary sugar. The oil in the carrot also gives it a distinctive flavor. This is found in the outer portion. Therefore, to increase the outer portion of a carrot is to increase its flavor. The same thing holds true with parsnips. MR. ROBERTS: What about mulching the carrots? DR. WERNER: We did try muching and growing with and without irrigation but we didn't feel that we accomplished much. In 1936, we analyzed carrots at intervals of 10 days to 3 weeks to follow changes in sugar content. We found during the middle of August, during the very hot'weather, thai there was a distinct drop in the percentage of sugar in the carrots. As the weather became cooler, the percentage went up. The core is the water-bearing tissue which supports the foliage. If the tops are large, you have large cores. However, there may be more to it than that. The idea that we have now is to select these small cored carrots by determining specific gravity. We are trying to develop seed from these carrots in the hope that we can develop lines of cawot3 that have small cores and, consequently, higher sugar content. But this will not be ready soon. If we have it in ten years, 1 will be very happy, but I am not at all sure. </seg>

At the rate of s{? per pound, field run, picked every day, the returns this last year were right around $100.00 per acre after the costs were deducted. In 1937 the figures showed around $70.00 profit. In 1936, it was very dry. The plants] were young and the profit was only $30.00. There was also somejprofit in 1935, the first year of bearing. "¦¦¦:'- '¦¦ i This particular owner was very optomistic and figured that profits would go on forevermore but, as the plants get older, the individual stalks get smaller. In our planting, we found large stalks in the sixth year but they got smaller very quickly and we could not bring them back with mulching or fertilizer. One thing I .might mention and that is to keep up your fertility as you go along and supply plenty of' water. Your Missouri bottom asparagus may get down to the water table in five or six years and you would not have to use supplemental water. On the hills around Omaha, we have demonstrated that; the roots have gone down 15 feet taking out all moisture aB theyj go.

         <seg id="p438">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 432 Some growers leave the asparagus tops to catch the snow then disk them under in late winter, cutting the tops right into the soil. In this way, the only loss is the small amount in the harvested crop. This year we started irrigating one-half of our new planting which is on the contour. We took soil samples and then watered (6" of wateri between August loth and 20th to replace the water that had been taken out. It was possible to pick out all during September and October irrigated rows at a distance as far as you could see the field. In early November, the unirrigated blocks were ripe but the irrigated blocks were quite green. The soil samples showed that the 6" of water were all gone. This shows how much .moisture asparagus can use. I am waiting with considerable interest to see what difference it will make in the first cutting next spring. Asparagus can get along under drouth conditions. It will live and produce a fair crop but it responds to irrigation very well, and it may be watered almost any time of year. MR.

We are changing our program just a little from the way it was printed. Mr. 0. S. Bare, Extension Entomologist, will be first on our after - noon's program. He will talk on "Controlling Psyllids on Potatoes and Tomatoes'. This insect is new to most of you but in the past season I am sure that the trouble we all had with it will make each of you more interested in learning how to handle it. Both Dr. Goss and Dr. Werner will appear on the program later and then we want to devote the rest of the time to an open discussion of vegetable growers' problems. Mr. Bare will be with us to help answer any questions on the control of insects. Since we didn't fill the after - noon program so full, we plan to have plenty of time for round table discussion. We will hear from Mr. Bare. MR. BARE: As Mr. Hankins has stated, this potato psyllid is rated as something rather new. I think there are very few growers, particularly in the eastern part of the state, that are familiar with it or can even recognize it. Even in the western part of the state, we find many growers who are perfectly familiar with the damage it does but say they know nothing about it. </seg>

Back in 1920-24 we had some trouble ¦with something on the potatoes but we didn't know what is was We confused it with disease, called it a "blight" and yet, from what I know of it now, I feel sure it was what we know now as potato psyllid injury. It was not known in this state at that time at all. Experiment Stations began to do research and found that what they had heretofore called a harmless little plant louse was causing most of our trouble. . I Controlling Psyllids on Potatoes and Tomatoes. '¦ ..'¦.'-¦,¦-¦'¦;¦-¦¦..¦¦ ¦ ':-. :• )¦ ¦ - ¦¦¦ O. S. Bare Extension Entomologist, Nebraska College of Agriculture. The problem presented by psyllids has attracted attention of Nebraska growers, mainly during the 'past four years, although there is reason to believe that it was present in western Nebraska, and did serious damage back in the early 19205. Colorado entomologists and horticulturists now believe that j psyllids were largely respon - ible for failure of the potato crop of 1911 in that state, and that they have done serious injury to tonjatoes and potatoes in a large number of the succeeding years. ] Psyllid damage In early years wait confused with wilt and blight diseases, and was not recognized as being a result of the work of what was ordinarily considered as a rather Insignificant plant louse The true nature of the trouble was recognized only after the Utah and Colorado Experiment Stations began experimental research on the problem a comparatively few years ago. Until 1938 the potato psyllid had!not been reported In any Ne - braska counties east of the Panhandle. In fact, its serious damage appeared to be confined to the two western tiers of Panhandle counties. However, jin the spring of 1938 it began to move eastward. Reports Were received successively of damage by it in Chase, Lincoln, Buffalo, Polk, Lancaster, and Otoe counties, and a later investigation showed it to be across the Missouri River in western lowa. Thus it appears to have travelled down the entire Platte valley, a distai.ce of about 400 miles, in 1938. Whether it has become permanently established in these new areas »nd just .how serious a pest it will prove to be iv those areas can be told only after a series of years. It did serious damage in several lew counties in 1938, and consequently it must be considered as a jotentially destructive pest of potatoes land tomatoes throughout its </seg>
         <seg id="p440">RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE known range. The potato or tomato psyllid is a small jumping plant louse, which when mature, measures only a tenth of an inch in length. In general form and markings it resembles a tiny harvest locust or cicada. The general color is gray with yellow or white lines on the head, thorax and abdomen. A white band crosses the base of the abdomen and a Y-shaped white mark is usually noticeable at the abdomen's tip. The wings are folded roof-like over the body. They fly or jump quickly if disturbed and are rather difficult to capture and identify. They can be captured quite readily early on a cool morning, when they are quite sluggish. If the vines are shaken at this time, the psyllids drop to the ground and try to crawl away. Little is known as to wintering of the adults. They have been found wintering only on the cedars of the Wildcat Range in Scotts Bluff and Banner counties, but as they are found scattered over a number of states it seems evident that they must overwinter under other conditions. In May the adults appear on their native host plants which con - sist mainly of wild groundcherries and buffalo-bur, although, any plant belonging to the potato family appears to be a suitable host. Eggs are laid and one or more generation of young are produced there. The eggs are tiny yellow objects and are placed on short stalks mainly along the edges of the plant leaves. They soon hatch, producing very tiny flat, orange-colored nymphs. These feed by piercing the plant leaves with their sharp beaks, and sucking out the plant juices. As they feed and grow, their color changes to yellow and finally to green. When nearly mature they are readily seen on the underside of the leaves, where they are firmly attached much on the order of scale insects. The entire life cycle requires from 15 to 30 days, depending largely on weather conditions. Newly transformed adults are yellowish in color, but soon change to a shade of tan that gradually darkens to gray. As soon as potato and tomato plants are available, the adults move to them and an ex - tensive infestation may soon build up. Both adults and nymphs of psyllids feed by sucking sap from the plants, but damage appears to be due, not so much to this feed - ing, as to the injection of some poisonous or toxic substance that causes the condition commonly referred to as "psyllid yellows" or "purple top. The immature nymphs appear to do the most damage. The first evidence of damage is a curling inward of the terminal leaves which change to a yellowish-green color, particularly along the edges. Growth of the plant is checked, and as the disease ad - vances, curling and yellowing of leaves become more general and </seg>

         <seg id="p442">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. HANKINS: One thing Mr. Bare didn't mention. We know, due to the size of this insect, that it is very important to cover the plant thoroughly because the insects are found underneath the leaves and especially on the lower leaves. Unless the material is put on underneath the leaves, the control is incomplete. It is necessary to have complete control because only a few of these insects can cause the death of a plant. Dusting sulphur, to which Mr. Bare referred, may be used but with a spray it is necessary to use at least 300 pounds pressure in order to get complete coverage and that takes a lot of strokes on a hand spray. A poor spray might be better than no spray at all although, as Mr. Bare says, we may not need to spray for this for another twenty or thirty years in this part of Ne - braska. MR. ROBERTS: Where are the adults found in the winter time? MR. BARE: They are on the foliage of cedars but on what part of the leaf, I do not know. MR. ROBERTS: Do you anticipate much damage next year, since the treatment was so effective this year? MR. BARE: It has been fairly easy to diagnose the potato trouble this year in central and eastern Nebraska but we may have entirely different difficulties to contend with next year. MR. HOPPERT: The apple grower sprays every year whether his trees have scab or not. The potato grower is going to have to do the same thing, isn't he? MR. BARE: Yes. That is the situation exactly. MR. HANKINS: If you think of any more questions along thfs line, we will take them up at the round table discussion. MR. HANKINS: This concludes our set program for the after - noon with the exception of Dr. Werner's part but we thought this was the time to take up the questions.

BARE: lam sure that was paused by oue of my insectß. We have a disease tnown as "melon wilt" which is caused by striped cucumber beetles. The beetle winters in trash and appears first in the summer on wild plants. Then as sbon as. the melon vines start growing, it passes to them and works] in three ways. The adult feeds on the foliage and blossom but) first lays eggs in the soil around the vine. When these eggs hatch into worms, they burrow into the roots of the plant and damage Ithepknt as well as carry a wilt disease. Control of this means control of the beetle and they are not easy to control. In years past, we have recommended a calcium arsenate and powdered hydrated lime, dusting the plants frequently and the soil around the pl^nt. That gives fairly good control but I have found in my own garden that the Ratenone dust used once a week for several weeks gives good results. The im - portant thing is to do it right at the start because after the beetle lays its eggs, it is too late to start dusting. Start just as soon as the plant is through the ground and keep at it. :' ¦ ' ¦ -.'-.-. ¦¦•¦.-.¦.-. ¦.: j : ¦' .'

         <seg id="p444">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE They report 100% control with its use. The only difficulty is to get the dry Pyrocide. It really is a stabilized pyretheum dust. That dust is harmless to human beings and animals but is intensely poison - ous to insects. Practically all of our flea beetles can be controlled by Rotenone dust. It controls a greater number of different insects than any other insecticide. MR. ROBERTS: Just what do you mean by the "blister beetle" or potato bug? MR. BARE: The blister beetle may be black, gray, purple, brown or even striped. It can be identified by the shape of the body. The young of the blister beetle feeds almost entirely on grass - hopper eggs. They are prevalent when grasshoppers are prevalent which may explain the great numbers we have found in recent years. One entomologist said he thought we ought not to fight this beetle because of its destruction of grasshopper eggs. Their control is difficult because they will not eat poison. Perhaps the best method we have found has been a mixture of sodium fluosilicate and hydrated lime, using equal parts by measure not by weight. Dust this on the plants freely. It doesn't kill im - mediately but with 48 hours the results are usually pretty good. The North Dakota Station has been doing some experimental work the last two years using— Barium fluosilicate (trade name "Dutox") —1 part Low grade flour —3 parts (by measure or volume) They found this cheaper and also that it sticks to the plants better, however, we haven't tried it. QUESTION: Is this the same beetle that bothers squash? MR. BARE: No. That is a squash bug. I was coming to that. That fellow has caused us a world of grief. He is even harder to control that the blister beetle. You will find they winter in trash and then when the squash comes up, lie on the under side of the leaves along the veins.

         <seg id="p446">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE If there are no further questions, we will have a talk by Dr. H. 0. Werner which we have saved until last. His subject is "What's Xew in Vegetable Growing". Dr. Werner. DR. WERNER: When Mr. Bare was telling how to handle the grown potato beetle, it reminded me of an experience I had some years ago. I was visiting the 4-H Potato Club .members in the French section of Louisiana. There were several things I didn't under - stand. One of the things I didn't understand was that evening be - gan at noon but another thing which puzzled me was these people talking about "bull moosing". It happened that the Colorado potata beetle made its appearance in that country about 1912 and had acquired the name of "Bull Moose" so the matter of handling the bug was "bull moosing". New ideas and new facts are published in journals and papers all the time and I thought it might be well to run through some of the newer things that have developed in the past year. Some Recent Developments in the Vegetable Industry H. O. Werner Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station The vegetable industry has been seeing a series of revolutionary changes and right now it is in the midst of another. These changes affect not only the agricultural practice of individual growers but of entire communities as well as industries sometimes considered somewhat remote from direct agricultural connections. These changes seem to be the result of developments in what for a timo appear to be equally remote industries or human activities. The commercial canning industry increased quite steadily and rapidly during the last 50 years. The first cause of this was the fundamental discoveries in the field of bacteriology by Pasteur and others following him. These discoveries made it possible to preserve vegetables with more certainty than there-to-fore. The development of modern factory methods increased the efficiency of the process and reduced the cost of the final product. Consequently storage of fresh vegetables in cellars gave way to the use of commercially canned goods. About 20 to 25 years ago the commercial vegetable forcing in - dustry in northern greenhouses was at its prime. Lettuce, cucum - bers, and tomatoes were the major crops. This industry has not advanced and in some instances it has decreased in size because of. </seg>
         <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY the improvement in refrigerated transportation facilities that gen - erally enable fresh vegetables from the winter garden regions thou - sands of miles away to be offered at a lower price on northern markets than must be received for the forced greenhouse vegetables. The head lettuce from the winter garden regions was found more desirable to most buyers than the loose leaf greenhouse lettuce. For a while the "hot-house" tomatoes enjoyed, an advantage over tomatoes .picked as green ripe and ripened in the warehouses, but then this advantage was largely eliminated with the discovery that the ripen - ing of tomatoes could be hastened with ethylene gas and that such tomatoes had practically as good quality as vine ripened fruit. At this same time the existence of vitamins and their function in nutri - tion were discovered. The general dissemination of information con - cerning their abundance in certain fresh vegetables contributed greatly to the increasing demand for fresh vegetables the year around. Market gardeners have constantly encountered keen competition, sometimes more or less unexpectedly, from more or less remote regions where ideal conditions exist for the production of special crops. I •.. Now a new industry is developing which will bring about many changes and may revolutionize the geography of vegetable produc - tion so that producers close to northern markets may become active winter competitors with the winter garden regions, the northern greenhouse vegetable industry and to a lesser but definite extent the canning industry. This new industry is the quick freezing of fresh vegetables made possible by the discovery of certain processes and by the efficiency of modern refrigeration machinery. The in - dustry is .hardly ten years old—but; already it is very extensive in various parts of the country.2 .; The modern vegetable and fruit freezing industry depends upon quick freezing at very low temperatures, i.e. 25 degrees below zero F. It seems that at these low temperatures, the ice crystals form - ing in the tissues are .much smaller than when freezing takes place slowly. The formation of these small crystals does not rupture the cells as do the larger crystals that form in slower freezing at tem - peratures just below the freezing point. According to recent reports somewhat over 200 concerns are doing quick freezing; 4,400 retail dealers are now handling the pro- | duct and production has been increasing at the rate of 50 to 60% 1 annually for the last few years with the U. S. Bureau of Commerce reporting the 1937 production of quick frozen foods as 240,000 tons 2 Hlbbs, Ben, Frosted Groceries, Country Gentleman, Dec. 1938, pp. 7, 8, 01, 05. </seg>
         <seg id="p448">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE of which about one-fourth were vegetables. Food Industries—a trade journal—in the Jan. 1939 number reports the pack of frozen vege - tables on hand Dec. 1, 1938 as 68,759,000 lbs. as compared to :.'2,503,000 pounds on Dec. 1, 1937. The principal vegetables being frozen are peas (over half the \egetable pack), asparagus, lima beans, snap beans, sweet corn, spinach, and broccoli. One novelty offered is frozen balls of honey dew melon. The industry has developed to a very extensive scale in Xe\r Jersey and Pennsylvania because of the nearness to large markets and consequent low delivery costs. For example, one Penn - sylvania grower is reported to be growing 600 acres of broccoli for free/ing. Freezing is a big industry in the northwest—but the high cost of transporting frozen products may become a serious deterrent once competition reduces the present high margin of profit. Some freezing is being done in the winter garden regions. The flavor of properly frozen vegetables is considered almost as good as the fresh product and the food value including the vitamin content is not materially impaired. The product has many advan - tages but is still rather costly. It is thought that prices can be brought down to the level of canned goods prices. If that can be done, some authorities venture the guess that frozen pack, the canned pack, and the fresh vegetables may eventually divide the market about equally. -Many problems of a technical nature are being encountered in connection with freezing methods. It also is becoming evident that some varieties are not suitable for this process and in some cases new varieties may need to be developed. Just what this industry will mean to Nebraska vegetable growers remains to be seen. For the last two summers vegetables have been frozen commercially in Nebraska. It may bring new competition or it may develop into a new industry depending upon the enterprise manifested in Nebraska vegetables and the trend of events in other regions, long distance transportion rates, etc. Some results of experimental work reported from other states is of considerable interest to Nebraska growers. The following are some of the items that seem most pertinent. Hardening of young tomato plants, even to a moderate degree was found to have a stunting effect on plants 3&amp;4. It was found that II Porter, A. M—Retarding effect of hardening on yield and earliness of tomatoes. Proc. Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci. S3: 512-344. 1033. I Brasher. E. P. &amp; AVestover. K.

         <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY such plants were not any better able to survive under field conditions They produced lower early yields and fruits were smaller. Early fruits are frequently very rough if hardening is carried to excess. In Indianas they found that by applying ammonium phosphate in water at transplanting time tomato plants grew more rapidly when transplanted, required less replanting, earlier fruiting was brought about and total yield was increased. A solution was made up at the strength of 2.3 lbs. to 50 gallons of water and this was applied at the rate of % pint per plant. The cost was about ?1.00 per acre. Treatments of this kind are most profitable on soils more or less deficient in phosphorus. Since very profitable increases in yield have been secured with the application of su^er phosphate to tomatoes on the hills around Nebraska City, it is reasonable to expect profitable returns from this method on the loess .hills and on any other soils where crops have responded to supplementary applications of phos - phorus, i ."'¦'¦ . .

         <seg id="p450">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Corn ear worm: Experiments conducted in KentuckyS during three or more years showed that most of the corn ear worm damage to sweet corn could be avoided by clipping off the tips of the ears about 6 days after pollination as indicated by the drying of the ends of the silks. By this time the maximum number of eggs will be removed and few newly hatched worms have had time to penetrate ears. When special care was used in clipping, and clippings were removed from the field, the percentage of infested ears was reduced from 80 to 90 per cent, to IS to 2 2 per cent. An acre or more of corn can easily be covered in a day. The cut ends of ears healed over well and after the public learned that these ears were generally free of worms they did not object to the clipped ears. Dusting ears with poison did not give any dependable control. This clipping method is practical for pardeners that can sell corn at a good price. Breeding work to secure sweet corn varieties that will be re - sistant to ear worm is being carried on at the new regional experi - ment station for vegetable breeding located at Charleston, South Carolina. There have been developed inbred lines with a high de - gree of resistance that transmit a considerable degree of resistance to their progenise.'J Several commercial varieties adapted to southern conditions have been found quite resistant.

Because of the change in dates of Organized Agriculture, you Will have two of these reports marked 1937 and it may cause some confusion if you file them.

HANKINS: This 'Concludes; our regular program but I am wondering if Dr. Werner might not have more to say about the effect this freezing of vegetables may have on the use of lockers in smaller towns. I know that over at poryell's they have asparagus, corn and cherries frozen. Not all fruits are suited to freezing and storing in lockers. Do you have something to Bay on this subject Dr. Werner? , — ; </seg>
         <seg id="p452">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE DR. WERNER; In order to handle fruits and vegetables in this manner, you have to have quite a low temperature to freeze them in the first place and, too, the vegetables or fruit have to be placed in trays to expose them to the cold and same fruits might not respond to this treatment. Vegetables must be blanched before being frozen, in order to set the color, and then are given essentially the same preparation as is given for caiining. They a&gt;re then frozen very quickly at a low temperature and stored but not at as low a tem - perature. Some of these locker plants have had some disappoint - ments in the quality of the things frozen. QUESTION: Is corn frozen in the husk? WERNER: No, it is husked and blanched then frozen on. the ear. There seems to be some difficulty in maintaining good color in corn and the skin seems to toughen up in some cases. MR. HOPPERT: Give us a list of vegetables that can be frozen successfully. WERNER: Peas, asparagus, beans, lima beans, and spinach. These are all very desirable because it is difficult to maintain flavor and texture of these particular vegetables in canning. QUESTION: Do you think the average cold storage plant could be arranged to handle these frozen vegetables? DR. WERNER: It would depend upon the volume of business they could expect. It is rather expensive to equip such a plant. QUESTION: At what temperature are the lockers kept? WERNER: 200 to 25^- below zero. MR. HANKINS: This subjet of quick freezing of vegetables is one that the growers will want to keep in mind. We may see some great changes in the future along this line. The vegetable growers do not have a society organized as yet and the horticultural society has sponsored this meeting. "We, here at the College, do not know just what you are interested in and what you would like to hear when you come to these meetings. If we continue these meetings, I think some cf you growers should volun - teer and let us know what you want on the program. I would like to get more vegetable growers on the program.

         <seg id="p454">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Nevertheless, there are some angles of it that I think we should talk about and think about. The most important thing it seems to me is cooperating in the packing and selling of our crop. I really believe that the growers of Nebraska would have benefited to the extent of 40c or 50c more per bushel if we had had such a set-up. It is fresh in my memory that at the beginning of the season, a lot of the growers became panicky and didn't know what to do with their apples. They thought they couldn't sell them but, after they had established sacrifice prices, the market developed; there was more tlemand, more interest from other states and a lot of us had our - selves tied to contracts that we couldn't get away from. I believe that with some sections producing good fruit and some sections the cheaper grades, if we had been under the cooperative selling ar - rangement, we could have netted more money and had a more uni - form distribution of fruit. The same thing may never happen again but I believe it will. Look to the south, from the reports we get, a lot of their trees have gone out of the picture. There is only a small amount of re - plants. Some of the eastern sections are in the same condition. West of us, the marketing conditions are improving to such an ex - tent that we won't have to worry so much about apples coming in from the west. Illinois is to be replanted, I understand, and that means we will have some competition from that state but, with the market opening for them to Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, that shouldn't give us much worry. We shouldn't have any trouble handling our own market here if we do certain things. We hear of no difficulty from the western growers, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington, because they are operat - ing under certain laws that are giving them benefits. They seem to be making money every year, getting wide distribution of fruit and fair prices. There is no reason why Nebraska couldn't do the same thing but we can't do it under the conditions of growing, packing and selling as we have them now. We will have to have certain grade laws that will give us a certain amount of protection. It is true that some growers will benefit a lot by a grade law but it will not benefit others. I believe in time that a uniform grade law in the state of Nebraska will give us a reputation we can be proud of. The weaker ones will be dropped, the ones that can't raise good quality fruit will be eliminated. There will be more induce - ment to men with capital and means to go into the fruit business. We wouldn't want to go out of existence in this state and I don't think it is necessary. We have a fine soil to work with, we have good growing conditions here, we have a College that puts in a lot </seg>

First of all, I will say I am iappy to be with you and to bring greetings from the lowa Horticultural Society which held its annual meeting November 10th arid 11th. We were very happy at that time to have your friend and my friend, Dr. Wiggans, on our program. I have heard a great many expressions of gratitude since that time and want to convey them to you now, Dr. Wiggans. . I also bring greetings from the American Pomologlcal Society with which your organization became affiliated last year. I just returned from a meeting of this Society at Chattanooga, Tennesee. Representatives from some fifteen states attended this meeting. A set of resolutions were drawn up. which I think are worth reading to you at this time. ' : \.' ' </seg>

That we express our thanks and appreciation to the various commercial and civic, state and national agencies, with special refer - ence to the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce, the Patten Hotel, and Radio Station WDOD, and the Chattanooga newspapers, who have given their hearty cooperation in arranging and carrying out the joint program of the 5 4th Convention of the American Pomological Society and the annual meeting of the Tennessee State Horticultural Society, and for the splendid cooperation and the fine hospitality enjoyed during the course of these meetings. 2. Resolved: That the American Pomological Society accept and deeply ap - preciate the reports and excellent work of Dr. W. A. Ruth and Dr. S. Jlarcovitch in presenting the facts on the spray residue situation. We recommend that the A.P.S. authorize the Spray Residue Committee of the A. P. S. to take such action as they deem advisable and best on future questions in connection with the spray residue problem. 3. Resolved: That the American Pomological Society urge all State Horticul - tural Societies and interested individuals to write Secretary of Agri - culture Wallace expressing appreciation of the raised tolerances of lead and florine that have recently been granted. We understand that the investigations of the United States Public Health Service have made this possible and urge that the spray residue research be continued. 4. Resolved: That the Superintendent of National Capitol Parks, Washington, D. C, be requested to adequately preserve the A. J.

Respectfully submitted, T. J. Talbert, Chairman C. E. Chase Brooks Drain R. M. Clark Chattanooga, Term. Dec. 3, 1938 NEW VARIETIES OK PROMISE FOR THE MISSOURI VAMjEY. by H. L. Lantz lowa Agricultural Experiment Station. Several times since 1933, fruit growers throughout the United States have come face to face with the problem of hardiness. Dur - ing the winter of 1933-34, New York and New England growers suffered severe losses in old trees o£ the varieties, Baldwin, Northern Spy and Rhode Island Greening. Again, a great area including the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri Valleys experienced a test winter in 1935-36 which killed thousands of trees including peaches and apples. Throughout the area which includes the Mis - souri Valley in lowa, Nebraska and parts of Kansas and Missouri our orchards suffered greatly due to the prolonged ana severe cold spell which began January 18 and which was not broken until Feb - ruary 21. Trees were killed outright and great numbers were in - jured. Some of these trees have already recovered, but many are wrecks and a liability wherever they are. It is not necessary here to categorically classify the kinds of winter injury found in our orchards. It is pertinent, however, to call attention to those varieties which sustained varying degrees of winter injury. Winter injury is not new to us, nor are the half - hardy varieties not pretty well known, but a winter like that of 1935-36 sharply focuses our attention upon vulnerable spots In our fruit growing business. In lowa, eastern Nebraska and Kansas and in northwestern Missouri, the Jonathan has been and still is one of our most valuable apples. Delicious is popular and profitable. Grimes is a most excellent apple, and so is the Winesap, the Stay - man, and the Golden Delicious. Unfortunately, each and everyone </seg>
         <seg id="p459">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY of these varieties occasionally suffer varying degrees of winter in - jury which results in financial loss. There are two ways of establishing longer lived, winter-resistant orchards. First, we can plant varieties of known winter hardiness; or, second, topwork our half-hardy sorts on hardy stocks. There are a number of winter hardy sorts, but unfortunately these have little or no standing as commercial sorts. The problem then is how to proceed in establishing new orchards in those areas which have heretofore depended upon varieties like Jonathan. First of all select the correct soil and site. This can not be over-emphasized. Then proceed to choose those varieties of proved performance in the gen - eral region and which have some standing in the general markets. In the Missouri Valley region, which comprises western lowa northwestern Missouri, eastern Nebraska and eastern Kansas, com - mercial production for the next decade will likely center around Jonathan, Delicious, Winesap, and Stayman, and with increasing emphasis on Jonathan particularly in the northern part of this area. No other variety exceeds Jonathan in popularity in lowa, and this applies with nearly equal emphasis in Nebraska. NEW VARIETIES, WHERE DO THEY FIT? A bewildering number of new varieties of fruits have been in - troduced during the past 20 years and for this reason we are per - !- haps prone to throw up our hands in confusion and dismiss the whole | subject of new varieties. This attitude-leads only to an acceptance i of the status quo. However, we do not "stay put" in horticulture. Varieties are constantly changing due to the Introduction of new and better varieties. Not over 25 years ago, Ben Davis was the leading commercial variety. Many of us well remember when Delic - ious was introduced. Its rapid climb to fame is unprecedented in the history of apple growing in the United States. Delicious illu - strates what can happen to the fruit industry when a "new-comer" is presented that possesses the characteristics of productivity, style, quality, and capacity for keeping. We believe therefore that new varieties should be carefully considered in every apple growing region. However, large plantings of new sorts are seldom warranted until j it has been proved by actual test whether they are adapted to the region. It might be worth while to consider what tests a new variety must meet in order to be worth our serious consideration, This has to be considered from :three general angles: the grower, the dealer, and the consumer. The growers' concern is that a variety be hardy, productive and reasonably resistant to disease. The dealers' interests </seg>
         <seg id="p460">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE lies in fruit which can be handled with a minimum of loss* such is is occasioned by scald, physiological storage diseases, and which have consumer or market appeal. Consumers, in general, buy apples with eye-appeal and that of course means attractive color, but in the long run consumers also show a decided preference lor quality. In the middle-west, Jonathan is pre-eminent as a commercial variety. It is the most important single variety grown. A prominent south western lowa grower said to me at the lowa State Horticultural Society meeting last month that it was, in his opinion, foolish to plant anything but Jonathan in lowa. Jonathan is a money maker, but severe Josses are often sustained due to fruit dropping, Jonathan spot, and because the tree is susceptible to winter injury, fire blight and cedar rust. In spite of these defects, Jonathan is a popular apple in the middle-west because of its reliable production, its at - tractive red color and unequaled quality. As grown farther south it becomes a fall apple. In Nebraska and on north it can be stored well until past mid-winter, at which time few good Jonathans from other regions are left to .market. Therefore, Jonathan is the variety that may well be used as a yard stick in measuring the value of new varieties. Are there any new varieties of the Jonathan type which are free of the defects of Jonathan? It appears that none of the new varieties which we have observed will displace Jonathan, but there are at least two which deserve consideration for extended trial, not because they are good enough to displace Jonathan, but rather because they may be valuable to supplement Jonathan, and because they are free of some of the costly defects of Jonathan. INTRODUCTION'S OF lOWA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION, AMES, lOWA. Apple breeding has been pursued as a major project at lowa State College almost from the time of the organization of the de - partment of horticulture. The work was established on Its present basis in 1905 when the late Professor S. A. Beach came to lowa to head up the horticultural work at the college. Many apple crosses were made, beginning in 1906 and continuing until 1912. Several crosses produced new apples of merit, ten of which were named in 1921, one in 1922, one in 1932 and one in 1938. The following is a list of the new apples originated and introduced: Salome x Jonathan Edgewood — Fruit hangs exceedingly well, late season. Secor — Fruit hangs well, "top" quality, late season. </seg>
         <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Mclntosh x Longfield . • ', Sharon — Excellent tree, good quality fruit. Maud — Excellent tree, fruit ripe September 1.

Hawkeye Greening— Most productive apple in orchard; fruit large, fair quality, culinary, for farm ...¦:'. orchards in north lowa., Mixed Late Seedling ' .... Adel — Very hardy, productive, late August to September 5; excellent quality. During the introduction and test period new apple varieties must answer by their performance some legitimate questions. How does their production compare with old standards? How long does it require for a variety to reach profitable production? Is the fruit easily grown? Does it hang to the tree? What about storage properties? We have rather definite answers to some of these questions, but the question of long time production still remains unanswered, be - cause tests have not run over a long enough period of years to determine longevity of trees, and their regularity of bearing. And because we know too little about the performance of new sorts, it is generally wise to go slow so far as extended commercial plantings are concerned. However, rather extended trials in lowa and other states of a considerable number of new apples indicates their pos - sible value. </seg>
         <seg id="p462">KICPoKT OF XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The variety test orchard at Ames was planted in 1925 to Vir - ginia Crab and was topworked by budding in 1926. There are about 250 to 300 varieties, new and old, in this orchard, grown for com - parative tests. New varieties from many sources are growing in this block, and some very interesting and valuable information is com - ing out of this experiment. In the case of Edgewood, Hawkeye Greening, Joan, and Sharon, 8 0 trees of each variety are available for study. Also, trees of Edgewood, Secor, and Sharon, now 8 and 9 years of age, have reached fruiting age in Harrison County, lowa. Many cooperating orchard - ists throughout the middle-west have bearing trees of these and other new varieties. Reports are almost unanimous in stating that Hawk - eye Greening is a tremendous fruiter; Joan too, and reports indicate good production in the case of Edgewood and Secor. Growers in Harrison County, lowa, who have trial plantings of Edgewood are interested enough in it to plant this variety rather freely, because it provides a very satisfactory late keeping apple of Jonathan type. Secor does well in Harrison County, but up to date is not so pro - ductive as Edgewood, but the fruit develops excellent large size, attractive color, and its quality is agreed upon as being exceptionally fine. Those who grow Sharon in western lowa are divided in their opinion as to its value. It makes a beautiful tree, bears young on the Loess soil, and the fruit is attractive, but lacks high color. Growers related to me this fall that for local market Sharon seemed valuable to supply the trade between Wealthy and Jonathan. The quality of Sharon is high and consumers like its aromatic flavor and tender flesh. It is far more valuable than Mclntosh in western lowa, be - cause it hangs to the tree well and keeps later. In 1924 a tract of 20 acres was planted with 10 rows of Vir - ginia Crab and 9 rows of Hibernal for stock. There were 40 trees in each row. In August of 1925 the following varieties were top - worked : Hibernal—Row I—Willow Virginia Crab—Row 10—Joan 2—Delicious 11—Willow 3—Grimes 12—Starking 4—Jonathan 13—Grimes s—Hawkeye5—Hawkeye 14 —Jonathan 6—Norwel 15 —Hawkeye 7—Edgewood 16—Norwel B—Sharon 17-Edgewood 9—Sharon 18—Sharon 19—Sharon </seg>
         <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY 457 The general purpose of this planting -was to make a comparative study of the new varieties and to study stock influences, and later on, as soon as the trees had reached the desired age, introduce culture and fertilizer tests. In 1932, the seventh year of tree growth, all of the varieties except Sharon bore fruit, though not a large crop. In 1932 the first crop year for this orchard, the Howkeye and Joan led in pro - duction with around 50 bushels per row, while Edgewood and Jonathan produced a little over 40 bushels per row. Starking and Grimes followed in order, with less than half as much fruit. Crops during succeeding years have varied considerably due to unfavor - able weather at blossom time, and in 1934 and 1936 because of drought. In 1937 the season started somewhat unfavorably but, with a good bloom on all varieties except Sharon, the trees set good crops. This year (1937) Hawkeye outyielded all other varieties, but Joan was a good second, followed in order by Jonathan, Edgewood, Starking, Willow and Grimes. In total yield for the six crop years the varieties maintained the same relative position for production as in 1937. At the end of the 1938 season, Hawkeye still led in production by a wide margin. Jonathan was followed closely by , Joan. I Based on the observations above referred to and on reports from cooperative testers, the following observations are offered in con - nection with the varieties described below: j Joan (Anisim x Jonathan). Joan stands out as a new variety because of its unusual productivity, excellent size and fine, solid red color. The trees are of spreading and drooping habit, with free ¦growing up-right branches in the upper center. The branches are wide-angled and resist breakage under heavy loads of fruit. The 40 11-year-old trees bore an average of about 11 bushels in 1937. Same trees produced 20 bushels, yet no limb breakage resulted in any of the trees. The fruit was unusually well distributed over the trees and with almost no clusters. : Joan is unique in that it produces plump fruit buds every year, of the amount of fruit on the tree. The trees in this tow of Joan have bloomed freely every spring since 1931. Joan fruits average uniformly 2a/ 4 to 3V 4 inches, are smooth, roundish and symmetrical in form, and are covered with a bright to deep tone of carmine. Few varieties equal it in attractiveness. </seg>
         <seg id="p464">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 458 The flesh is nearly white, tender, coarse grained, juicy, mild subacid, fair quality. Its market season is October to December. If placed in cold storage when harvested it holds well through January. It is comparatively scab resistant. Joan does not have the high flavor of favorite varieties like Jonathan or Delicious. It has excellent culinary qualities. For bak - ing it rates nearly equal to Rome Beauty, and for sauce and pies it is excellent. In the stores merchants report that Joan sell on ap - pearance because of its uniformly good size and color. Despite the lack of high dessert quality, Joan has many com - mendable characters. It cannot longer be denied a place in our home orchards and in orchards planted to supply local markets. In the nursery the trees of Joan tend to be uniformly vigorous and produce characteristic wide-angled branches which do not break easily. Secor (Salome x Jonathan). Secor is an apple of "top" quality. The fruit is larger than Jonathan, keeps six weeks later and is free of Jonathan spot. The coloring is not equal to Jonathan, but in tests in western lowa, it matures with excellent size and with good, bright, cherry red color. Secor has been accepted by official horticul - turists in Wisconsin and in Ontario, Canada, as a new apply worthy of extended test. It is an apple of sufficient merit to warrant ex - tended test wherever Jonathan does well. Trees of Secor are of good orchard habit and at Ames have been regularly productive. The fruit hangs better than Jonathan and matures a week to ten days later. In the nursery row Secor trees are not as strong and vigorous as is desirable, but make salable trees as two-year cutbacks. In the orchard young trees have shown susceptibility to fire blight. The fruit of Secor is above medium in size, oblate in form, and when well colored is nearly covered with a bright cherry red with obscure to distinct stripings of darker red; prevailing effect is medium red with striping. The flesh is yellow, firm, crisp, tender, fine grained, very juicy, with a rich, sprightly, subacid flavor equal to or ever superior to Jonathan. Its storage season extends to April, and the fruits are free of Jonathan spot. The quality rating of fruits of Secor is very high. Secor is a promising apple for Jonathan regions where growers find it desirable to grow late maturing varieties. It will not displace Jonathan, but should be tried as an apple to supplement the Jonathan, since the fruit matures later on the tree and keeps longer. </seg>
         <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Edgewood (Salome x Jonathan). Edgewood is a variety which ¦will not interest nurserymen because of its weak growth in the nursery row. For the orchardist who wants a late maturing, late keeping apple of the Jonathan type and who will topwork it on Virginia Crab, Edgewood has few equals. The fruits mature on the tree late in the season and hang with unusual tenacity. In the station orchards fall winds have never caused loss of Edgewood by reason of drops. The fruits are ready to pick at Ames about the 10th to 15th of October (two to three weeks later than Jonathan). In storage it keeps as late as Willow Twig and is free of Jonahan spot. Drought spot has caused some loss, but these losses have not been serious. In the orchard the fruit is comparatively resistant to apple scab. : Edgewood averages larger in size than Jonathan, is much the same general shape. The color is a light to deep, bright cherry red laid on over greenishryellow to yellow skin color. It is an attrac - tively colored apple. Packages of Edgewood open most atractively at market time. The flesh is firm, crisp, medium grained, very juicy, sprightly subacid and resembles Jonathan in flavor. In the early winter the acid is too sharp for many tastes, but this mellows to a desirable degree as the storage season advances. The fruit keeps well until April, May or June, depending on storage conditions. Trees of Edgewood on Virginia Crab in the station orchards are almost identical with Jonathan in habit of growth and in foliage characteristics and compare favorably with trees of Jonathan of the same age, though they are not quite so large. Hawkeye (Vermont seedling). Hawkeye is by far the most pro - ductive apple in the station orchards. The trees are almost ideal in every respect, except that the fpllap becomes more or less "ragged" toward the end of the growing season; but no perceptible injury to the tree or fruit results from the failure of the foliage to remain plump and clean throughout the season. The trees are of wide - spreading habit and require almost no pruning. The tree blooms about two days ahead of Jonathan and bloom annually. The fruit is borne on spurs and terminals, often in pairs, and usually sizes up to an average of 23/4 to 3 inches or larger. The fruit of Hawkeye Is pale green, turning to yellowish-gTeen as it ripens, and often develops a pink cheek. Its color is attractive for an apple of this type and it is easily kept free from apple scab. The flesh is tender, fine grained, juicy, sprightly subacid, plain in flavor, and rates fair quality. Season October to March. </seg>
         <seg id="p466">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE It is a desirable apple for culinary use, cooks up quickly and smoothly, makes good sauce and excellent pies and is in condition for use for many months, October to February in common storage. Because of the hardiness of the trees and the unusual produc - tion, Hawkeye is a useful apple for the home orchard. In central and northern lowa it is suitable for limited plantings for local mar - keting. Trees in the nursery are strong growers and have a wide-angled branching habit. Shuron (Mclntosh x Ivongfield). There are 80 trees of Sharon worked on Virginia Crab, and a like number are on Hibernal. These trees are remarkably uniform in growth and have made strong, shapely trees, but did not come into full bearing until 1938. Some fruit has been produced, but nothing like a regular, well set, uniform crop such as has been produced by Joan or Hawkeye Greening. Whether this is due to unsuitable soil, to the stocks, to hot, dry summers, or whether it is an inherent characteristic of Sharon Is not clear, because on other soils Sharon has come into full bearing early and the tendency has been to overbearing rather than the reverse. Trees of Sharon grow to near perfection in the nursery row, are strong, vigorous growers in the orchard and have an abundance of excellent foliage. The fruit is largely borne on spurs and ready to pick about September 20th at Ames. Sharon fruits are of uniform medium size and shape; the color - ing is attractive, about one-third to two-thirds of the surface being covered with stripes and splashes of cherry red to carmine. The flesh is very tender, juicy and has a mild aromatic flavor. The quality for dessert rates very good, and for culinary purposes it rates high and makes an excellent sauce and delicious pies. The season in good, common storage extends through January, but for best results the fruit should be used through November and De - cember. Sharon is too good an apple to go into discard, and because in many cases it has a good record for production it can be •recom - mended for home orchard planting; and it has merit for planting to supply local markets in central and northern lowa. Eat'lham (Colorado Orange x Jonathan). Earlham is mentioned because it has been well received in South Dakota. The late John Robertson, Hot Springs, grew Earlham and found it to be hardy and productive and recommended its propagation for trial in South </seg>
         <seg id="p467">j NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY I Dakota. It is now catalogued by a South Dakota nursery firm, prob - j ably on the strength of Mr. Robertson's experience. | The tree is a strong, open grower, both in the nursery and in i the orchard, and has excellent foliage. - -. i The fruit as grown at Ames is large. It is a uniform, attrac - tive, clear greenish-yellow apple. The flesh is firm, coarse, mild, I pleasant subacid, fairly juicy and good quality. Season April-May. Earlham may be useful in central and northern lowa, and on northward if the tree continues to be satisfactory. Ames (Allen Choice x Perry Kusset). Ames has characteristics which commend it for trial wherever Jonathan does well. It re - quires fertile soil and favorable late summer and fall weather to properly mature it. In western lowa and eastern Neuraska, Ames does well and has finished with large,'well-colored red fruit of good quality. The tree of Ames is twiggy and .bears its fruit on slender ter - minal growths and in clusters which necessitate thinning in order to, secure well-finished fruits. More information is needed concern- I ing the tree behavior of Ames before it can be recommended for ex - pended trial. ¦ The flesh of Ames is' yellow, firm, tender, medium grained, medium juicy, mild pleasant subacid, and rates good in quality. , Season January to March. Maud (Mclntosh x Longfield). Little attention has been paid to early apples in our breeding program, because it was felt that the early season varieties were fairly satisfactory and that "we already had too many early apples." However, an early apple of really good dessert quality would be an asset, because our hardy "old reliables" like Yellow Transparent, Duchess, and even the Wealthy, are about as well known for their faults as for their good qualities. Maud is. an attractive red apple of good quality, which is in season between the Duchess and Wealthy. The tree is a good grow - er in the nursery and the orchard and is reliably productive. The fruit is medium to below medium in size, roundish in form, with a good, nearly solid red color. The flesh is white, tender, juicy, sprightly subacid and superior to Duchess for eating- out of hand. The tree of Maud appears to be hardy and seems well adapted to lowa conditions. </seg>
         <seg id="p468">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Xorwel (Northwestern Greening x VVealtliy). This apple was named in September of 1938. It is a seedling of Northwestern Green - ing x Wealthy. It is a high class cooking apple and equal to Wealthy for eating out of hand. The fruit is larger than Wealthy, but is much the same shape. The color is of the Wealthy type, but is not so well colored as Wealthy. The flesh is firm, crisp, rather fine grained, very juicy, sprightly subacid and rates very good. It matures on the tree about two weeks later than Wealthy and is prime tor use through October and November. Tests in North and South Dakota show the tree to be of unusual - hardiness. It is a vigorous growing tree in the nursery and orchard with excellent foliage which withstands drought, heat and scab in - vasion. The fruit is somewhat subject to scab, but is reasonably easy to grow. It bears tremendous crops but is a biennial cropper. This year forty 1 a-year old trees bore a total of 741 orchard boxes of fruit. Xorwel drops rather freely, but not worse than Wealthy. In those areas where trees must be really hardy, Norwell may be useful. JfEW APPLES FHOM OTHEIt SOURCES. A number of new apples which were introduced by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station, Geneva, New York, are under test in the station orchards. The following list is of general interest. These were topworked on Virginia Crab in August of 1926 and the trees have made an excellent growth. The seedlings of Mclntosh which include the Early Mclntosh, Milton, Macoun and Cortland, have not produced well, and under our conditions the fruits have dropped badly. However, the unusual summer heat and drought which has prevailed in lowa since 1930 may be responsible for the failure of these excellent varieties to fruit well at Ames. It is the recognized horticultural experience that Mclntosh and its seedlings thrive best in those regions in which summer temperatures are moder - ate. Cortland has done well in several orchards lying along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and in such locations may have value for home orchards and for limited commercial plantings in lowa. Haralson, was introduced by the University of Minnesota Fruit Breeding Farm some years ago. It has a remarkable record for pro - duction and hardiness of tree. Tree at Ames have made excellent growth, and have been productive. The fruit is red and striped, above medium to large size, and attractive.

Stayman trees are not hardy in most sections of lowa and the fruit tends to crack badly. Turley in lowa appears to be hardier than Stayman, is more productive, the fruit sizes up satisfactorily, colors well and Is free of stem-end cracking. In 1938 trees of Turley in Harrison County, lowa bore well and the fruit was of excellent finish, size, color and Quality. By comparison with Stay - man in the same orchard it was'far superior in every way. Turley appears to be a valuable apple for lowa and Nebraska. SUMMARY In lowa and in other states of the Mlddlewest there is a great deal of new interest in planting orchards. The commercial growers of 1 southern lowa will likely plant more of Jonathan than of other varieties, with Delicious or its red sports next in order of importance. Grimes has lost favor rapidly because of collar-rot and because the consumer trend is toward red apples. Grimes is productive and the fruit is of excellent quality, but unless it is handled expertly so as to market it without bruises or scald, it makes a poor showing on the market. Poor handling from picker to package has been respons - ible for much of the loss of prestige that Grimes once held. Golden Delicious is gaining in favor in south lowa. It is a productive variety under certain conditions, but under lowa conditions the fruit has been erratic in finish, is subject to spray injury, and often de - velops large russet dots which detract from its appearance. It is apparent that dilute sprays will improve the finish; topworking on hardy stockß seems important since it is none too hardy; and when the trees are overloaded the fruit must be thinned. In other words, special practices are needed to grow Golden Delicious under lowa conditions. Stayman is of little value on most soils of southern lowa, but Turley is promising as a variety to plant in its stead. Winesap is less popular in lowa than formerly, but in eastern Ne - braska is a good apple. Few growers recommend Mammoth Black Twig. Ben Davis and Gano have lost favor, but some growers feel that these varieties will be profitable if planted on a limited scale. New varieties suited to loess soils of western lowa and eastern Nebraska for limited commercial plantings are Secor and Edgewood. Joan may have a place as a variety to supply fruit for the trade a month ahead of the normal Jonathan season. </seg>
         <seg id="p470">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Northern lowa and northern Nebraska is a home orchard area, although on the right locations a few small commercial orchards have been very successful, but these orchards are topworked orchards. Summer and fall varieties such as Duchess, Wealthy, and Fameuse are still the standard sorts; and for winter, Brilliant, Malinda and Northwestern Greening are reliable. Throughout northern lowa farmers have need hardier and more productive apples, and now such varieties are available. The new hardy varieties, such as Beacon for summer, Joan for late fall, the Sharon and Hawkeye for winter, and Haralson for late winter, are a superior lot and worthy of serious consideration for home orchard planting throughout central | and northern lowa and other regions of like soil and climate. These new apples are valuable because of their productivity and their de - sirable fruit qualities. Nurserymen are listing many of the new varieties listed in the paragraphs above. In northern lowa and northern Nebraska those new varieties which are hardy should be planted rather than the half-hardy varieties such as Jonathan, Delicious or Grimes. PROF. LANTZ: The Jonathan is the most popular of all the varieties grown in lowa and will be in the future. Is that true in your state? MR. HOPPERT; Not quite to the same extent it is in lowa. From Nebraska City north I think it is; but farther South it shares first place with Winesap. Jonathan has some serious faults that have shown up in these recent dry years and as a result it is losing some of its former popularity. LANTZ: What do you consider your dominant varieties? MR. HOPPERT: Winesap, Jonathan, and Gano in Richardson county. LANTZ: The new varieties, Secor and Edgewood (cross be - tween Jonathan and Salome) have been fruited successfully in a number of locations in lowa. These do very well on the loess soils in western lowa. DEARLE BAKER: Mr. Marshall, do you have either of these new varieties in your nursery and have you anything to say about them? MR. MARSHALL: Yes, we do have them but I can't go into detail about the results obtained for we are still waiting to see how they will develop. PROF. LANTZ: Another apple that is causing considerable core. </seg>

It has strong branches and last year when the twelve year old trees aver - aged 11 bushels to the tree, no branches broke under that tremen - dous load of fruit. It ripens between the Wealthy and Jonathan but if stored promptly the fruit will keep until the middle of January, or even later in cold storage. ! MEMBER: The Gano is not popular, I know, but we still have a good market for them. Would this apple take its place? LANTZ: The Joan won't keep as long as the Gano although it hangs on the tree well. From the standpoint of the coddling moth and scab control, it is easier to grow than Gano. The Sharon (cross between Macintosh and Longfieid) is a very popular apple with us. It is good for home orchards and has some possibilities as a market apple. The Turley is taking the place of the Stayman in lowa. Hun - dreds of acres of this variety are being planted in southern Indiana and Illinois. It is hardier than the Stayman, colors up better and is entirely free from stem end crack. One fault with it is that it ripens too fast unless put into cold storage at once. I would recom - mend it to you for trial. I would like to show you some slides now of the orchards at Ames.

         <seg id="p472">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PRELIMINARY RESUI/TS FROM IRRIGATING APPIiES on the UNIVERSITY FRUIT FARM, UNION, NEBRASKA C. C. Wiggans Department of Horticulture As has been shown by previous reports, soil moisture tests made in the University apple orchard at Union have indicated that sub - soil moisture depletion might be expected to soon reach a critical point. These IK-20 year old trees had already utilized the major share of moisture reserves in the upper 30 feet of soil and the rate of annual water usage exceeded considerably the annual precipita - tion. Under such circumstances the useful span of the orchard's existence soon would pass unless something was done to bolster the water supply. During the late fall and winter of 1936-7 plans were made to install a pumping plant on the Weeping Water Creek and pipe water to various parts of the orchard. Basins were made around or under each tree to permit proper retention of the water until it was absorb - ed by the soil. The whole installation was made under a WPA Pro - ject—the only cost to the Horticultural Department being for materials. Another project the following winter extended the pipe - line, completed lateral construction, and provided bench terraces for future use by orchard trees. The time has now arrived to report the first results so that the findings to date may be available to the fruit growers of the state. COSTS Costs naturally can be classified under two heads—installation and maintenance. In this case maintenance costs can be figured much more accurately than installation since many labor Items in the latter can not be definitely segregated from some of the other work. Installation Costs. Installation costs include all machinery and all materials and labor involved in pipe placement, pump house construction, and the building of basins and lateral distribution ditches.

         <seg id="p474">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 4. The per acre cost is considerably greater than similar appli - cations to ordinary farm crops because more labor is neessary to secure proper distributing the water. 5. Power costs are somewhat high because of lift necessary to place the water on top of the ridge. 6. No allowance is included for taxes since the state owned land is not assessed for taxation. Cost figures are important only as they can be correlated with apparent results and definite results with any tree crop are some - times hard to measure. Investigators have reported that the full effect of water application may not be visible until the second or even the third year. First effects appear as improved foliage and this was definitely seen on the trees involved. Leaves apparently were larger and remained much brighter in color than on unwatered trees. At no time in the summer did the irrigated trees appear to be wilted but this appearance was universal on the check trees, particularly during late September and early October when the temperatures were high and rainfall slight. Improved foliage conditions should nat - urally etfect tree performance not only during the current year but also in the year following. Another evidence of improved vigor in the tree was observed in the amount of water sprout development which occured on trees which were carrying winter injuries from two or three years before. Old Stayman and Blaclitwig snags produced sprouts 6-8 feet long and water sprout growth generally was greater in the watered areas. Along with this come naturally better recovery from hail damage suffered three years earlier when nearly all spur growth had been lost from many trees. Regardless of greater vigor and improved leafage, however, un - less irrigation results in either greater yield or better fruit, it will fail as an economic practice. Possibly the 1938 crop cannot be taken as an absolute criterion on this point, but results are at least sug - gestive. Representative trees were selected before harvesting began. Some of these had received water, some had not, and others had been under a straw mulch treatment (but with no supplemental water i for a number of years. Yields between check, mulched, and irrigated trees did not vary widely and from 25 to 40 bushels were used as samples from which to secure the figures given below. The fruit was sized according to diameter, but no effort was made to grade it. Little difference could be noted, however, in color or finish except that the mulched trees seemed to have fruits with less color. Mulching seemed to stimulate dropping also more than the other treatments. </seg>

         <seg id="p476">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 470 Conclusions to be reached from these data perhaps should not be too definite since several disturbing factors are present. Some varieties were loaded quite heavily and others, particularly the Jonathan, had only a light crop. In the latter cases naturally much less effect on size could be noted. Evidence sees conclusive, however, that water did increase fruit size by materially reducing 1 the per - centage of fruit in the smaller sizes. In the case of large fruited varieties such as York and Delicious the effect on size was not so marked as with Duchess, Grimes, and Winesap whose fruit all too often is inclined to run somewhat small. The changes in percentages may be noted by reference to the table. Mulching, too, while not adding any water to the soil did conserve rainfall and likewise had a bfneficial effect upon fruit size. Where supplemental water is out of the question, mulching seems to be one way by which rainfall can be made more useful. Turning now to another phase of the experimental project it will be recalled that in last year's report mention was made of an attempt to replenish completely the subsoil moisture in a small block of Delicious. In June and July, 1937, 43 Inches of water was applied. Later sampling showed that the moisture had become stabilized to a depth of 30 feet at approximately water holding capacity. Samp - lings were made at frequent intervals during the season of 1938, but those for only one date are included in the table for comparison with those of the previous year.

         <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA STATE.HORTICULTURE SOCIETY An inspection of these data reveals that the rainfall of 22 68 inches occurring between November 9, 1937, and October 26, 1938, apparently was insufficient to supply the needs of the trees, the com - peting annual crops, and direct evaporation losses. Just how much water^as utilized for the two latter needs was not determined. However, the amount of water used for all purposes was 22.68 inches Plus 15.2 inches or a total of 37.88 inches. Comparable figures given in the 1937 report were 31.24 inches-figures not so far apart jvhen seasonal differences and increased tree size and age are con - sidered. Greatest loss of soil moisture occurred in the upper 20 feet of soil. On the basis of 43 trees per acre, the water usage figures given above indicate that each tree used about 3/ 4 acre inch of water. This represents approximately 21,000 gallons or about 80 tons of water. These calculations may give orchard planters a lead con - cerning spacing distances, that is, one tree for each 3/ 4 inch of annual rainfall. ; MR.

I only wish we had more time to discuss this subject We are certainly all interested in it. Of course, we can't all have irrigation and must depend upon our own resources. For this reason, We are interested in orchard sanitation if it will help in the control of insect pests, as Professor Bare says. I now introduce Professor O. S. Bare whose subject is "Orchard Sanitation Helps to Control Insect Pests". MR. BARE: I always like to talk to the fruit growers because they all know and realize what the control of insects means to their crop production. </seg>
         <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Orchard Sanitation Helps to Control Insect Pests 0. S. Bare Extension Entomologist, Nebraska College of Agriculture. Importance of orchard sanitation as an insect control measure can scarcely be over-emphasized. Nevertheless it is more or less neglected by the majority of small orchardists, and even some of the really extensive growers. In most farm orchards it is largely lacking. With such insects as the codling moth it is a necessary supple - ment to any successful spraying program, and in the case of many seriously destructive insects, particularly certain borers, It is the only really effective control known. Orchard sanitation may take the form of any one, or any com - bination of several measures. Pruning out and burning of dead, dying, or other infested material before the insects emerge from it is one of the most im - portant sanitation measures, and is particularly applicable to insects of the borer type. Among very common and destructive pests that might be named in this group are the flat-headed apple tree borer, the grape cane borer, the raspberry cane borer, the snowy tree cricket and various twig girdlers. Destruction of wormy fruit, particularly windfalls and thin - nings is a second sanitation measure that should be practiced by every fruit grower. Many of our most serious orchard pests spend a large part of their life cycle in such material and can be fought very successfully at that time. Insects for which this is one of the important control measures include the codling moth, apple maggot, apple curculio, plum curculio and oriental peach moth. A third sanitation measure, that often is of prime importance is the destruction of accumulations of leaves, brash, and rubbish in which many insects hibernate through the winter. In most cases this material should be gathered and burned late in the fall to be most effective. Among the many fruit pests against which this measure may be used effectively are the grape leafhopper, apple leafhopper, grapevine flea beetle, and grape berry moth. This measure, however, may act as a double edged sword, for such material may carry a heavy population of beneficial insects. Furthermore, destruction of it may under certain circumstances result in extensive soil erosion. The orchardist must use his best judgment in deciding where this measure of sanitation is desirable, and be guided accordingly. </seg>
         <seg id="p479">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY The keeping down of heavy weed growth, and the clearing away of brush and certain wild fruit trees or bushes in the immediate vicinity of the orchard will greatly reduce or even avoid infestations of some types of orchard insects. Several kinds of these pest com - monly develop in such places, and later, move into the orchards Out - standing among these are the buffalo treehopper and the grape cane barer. ; Plowing or cultivation of insect-infested soil may sometimes be classed as an orchard sanitation measure. Certain orchard insects spend a large part of their lives in the pupal or inactive stages in the upper few inches of soil or in vegetable matter that may be de - stroyed by cultivation or plowed under so deeply that the mature insects cannot emerge. Thus the cherry fruit fly spends approximately ten months of the year in the pupal stage in the upper two or three inches of soil, and one of the recommended control measures for it is extensive cultivation to destroy many of the pupating insects and expose others to the attacks of predatory animals, birds, and insects. Following is a list of some common orchard pests that may be at least partly controlled by sanitation measures around the orchard, and a statement of sanitation .measures that may be used: Codling moth—Scrape trees to destroy hibernating places. Prune thoroughly and destroy the prunlngs. Repair bad wounds where larvae might winter. Destroy wormy fruit promptly Clean up orchard debris. Clean up packing sheds, picking boxes or baskets, ect., very thoroughly. Tight. screening of packing sheds is desirable. ¦ ¦ : ¦ ... ' ¦. - . * " ; kpple maggot—Pupae winter in soil.

         <seg id="p480">REPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cumlations in late fall or very early spring. Clean culture is a big help in preventing overwintering of adults. Grape-berry moth —Pupae winter in leaves and vegetable trash. Plow under deeply and disk in fall or early spring, or burn trash in late fall. Grape root-worm—Pupates in soil within two or three inches of sur - face. Cultivation during the first half of June will destroy many. Grapevine flea beetle—Winters in rubbish around and in vineyards. Destroying such rubbish in late fall is an important control measure. Grape cane borer—Develops and winters in dead and dying limbs of trees and certain shrubs. Gather and burn dead and dying limbs, prunings, and badly infested trees or shrubs in late fall. Raspberry cane-borer —Red-necked cane-borer —Raspberry cane mag - got—All pass the winter in raspberry canes. Cutting out and burning all dead, dying, mutilated or weakened canes before growth starts In spring is the standard control measure. Des - troy all wild and neglected bushes in the vicinity of the planta - tion. Raspberry fruit-worm—Winters as adult or pupa two or three inches beneath surface of soil. Cultivate soil late in fall. Tree crickets—Eggs winter in raspberry and blackberry canes and pithy stems of similar plants. Cutting out or burning such canes in fall or early spring is an effective control measure. Strawberry leaf-roller —Mow and burn over patch after the crop is gathered. Winter is passed in folded leaves. Rake and burn them before mulching strawberry bed in fall. In conclusion we may say that while orchard sanitation in most cases must be ranked second to a spraying or dusting program for control of most orchard insects, it must be classed as a necessary supplement in controlling the majority of them, and, for a consider - able number of orchard pests, it is the most effective control measure known. Its consistent use greatly simplifies problems of orchard in - sect control, and in many cases may even render other control meas - ures unnecessary. It should be noted also that orchard sanitation is just as Important in control or eradication of orchard diseases as it is in control or eradication of troublesome insects. A volume could be written on its use in the field of plant pathology, but it is suf - ficient to state that it Is an outstanding method of controlling many plant diseases, and is indispensable in controlling a considerable num - ber of them. </seg>

Unfortunate - ly it did not work out that way last year because we had about the worst storm of the entire winter during that particular week; Un - daunted by this coincidence, however, the Board again chose this same week for the 1938 meetings. Perhaps the Board of Directors of the Society should change the fiscal year of the Society's activities from January 1 to January 1, to December 1 to December 1.

I believe that one of our new officers has prepared a speech but before I call on him, I would like to introduce a gentleman who is visiting here today from our neighboring state of Missouri, George Groh. Perhaps many of you know him. Will you please stand up, George. Another visitor is Mr. Evans from near Kansas City. Are there any other distinguished visitors that we should Introduce at this time? If not, I was wondering, George, if you could give us and high lights on the meeting held in Missouri last week. GEORGE GROH: It was very much like your meeting here. We had several interesting papers, the outstanding one, I think, was by Dr. Wiggans. It was so good that he is going to get an invitation to come back. D. BAKER: What reaction did you get on the talk on grade law? MR. GROH: They want some sort of legislation but, as I understand it, the eastern people want to establish it on the pure food law basis and that doesn't set well with our growers. D. BAKER: Do you have anything to add Mr. Evans? MR. EVANS: The apple cull law received quite a lot of discus - sion. At Muscatine, lowa, about three weeks ago I talked with a County Agent there. He said the boys from Illinois and Missouri were sending their culls into lowa. The Missouri boys feel the same way about lowa and Nebraska. Personally, I bought some culls and </seg>

My idea is this that when be begin to restrict the movement of apples, we are going to lower the amount of apples used If this enforcement is put into the hands of the Pure Food people we are going to get into still deeper water. The cull proposition is a big one, I know. I talked with Professor Gardner of Michigan and he told me they manufactured 50,000 containers of cider and. shipped it to Miami in order to use their culls. Perhaps by increasing the sale of our by-products, we can save the situation in that way rather than by passing more laws which .may later embarrass us I don't know how to solve the cull problem but I don't believe the passage of more laws is the right way. PROF. LANTZ: At the Chattanooga meeting, trie president of the Pomological Society, who has been active in the east in getting things done about the cull problem, suggests that the Pure Food and Drugs people take over this phase. I don't believe, evin after listen - ing to his explanations, that growers would be willing to accept that situation. : J Professor Pickett recommended that instead of the Pure Food j and Drugs people handling it, that the growers stud) the situation and recommend to the U. S. Department of Agricultu-e the type of regulation to which they would like to submit. Ii that way, I think we would get a more sympathetic hearing by keeping It in the U.S.D.A. and working it out with Secretary Wallace. However, the eastern states seem to favor the Pure Food and Drig Department but we out here I am sure do not. D. BAKER:. I believe that the Apple Institute is doing a won - derful piece of educational work in bringing before the people the value of apples, stimulating sales by sponsoring "App c Week" and "Apple Day" and developing new by-product outlet rand by in - teresting private companies and capital in the indusfay. | I noticed a new product, "apple chips". That is the sort of thing which .will help to do away with the cull apple. As I said before, one of our new officers, Val ICeyser, has a talk ready for us but since it is getting so late, he has asked that his speech be saved until after lunch. Therefore, the meeting will be adjourned at this time and we will hear from Val later. THURSDAY AFTERNOON—December Btli j D. BAKER: The meeting will please come to order.

VAL KEYSER: You were mistaken when you said I had a speech prepared. I only wanted to thank the members of the Horticultural Society for electing me to the office of Second Vice President thi;s morning. It pleased me very much. I do have something to say to Hoppert but will have a round with him later on. D. ISAKER: As most of you know, each year the Secretary takes a trip and goes places and sees things and brings back a story of interest to all of us. He started out this past summer with a new camera and, according to his story, had a nice trip. I saw a few of his pictures and they are fine. He has consented to show them to us now and we will pretend that we are traveling along with him on this tour. Showing of a very interesting and instructive set of slides in natural color. Tin- Secretary goes travelling with his Camera. Here at Nebraska, the Secretary is expected to take a rather active pan not only in making up the program for the annual meet - ings of the society but he also is expected to appear on the program occasionally. This year it happens that the Secretary has taken up ,i new hobby namely, that of taking pictures on colored film: After the film is developed it is placed between two pieces oE glass to make what is commonly known as a slide and this slide is thrown on a screen thru a lantern and the picture is shown in natural colors, (that is provided the operator gives the film the proper exposure). Last spring shortly after I bought the camera, came the "Blos - som Tour 1 sponsored by the Fruit Growers around Nebraska City, and the Chamber of Commerce of that bustling little city. That was the first test I gave my new toy. The cherry and apple trees in full bloom provided a number of suitable settings for pictures. The first half dozen pictures are taken on this tour. The last of June the family was loaded up in the car and we started for the land of sunshine, and earthquakes, of the glamorous movie queens and old age pension schemes. But before getting- to the orange groves we passed through a lot of interesting country. At Clovis in New Mexico a small home orchard attracted my atten - tion, not because it was better cared for than our own, but because it had offered resistance to the dust laden wind that blew over from </seg>

The .horticulture of-New Mexico Is not confined i o watermelons and muskmelons but we did see a lot of these grow i where water was available for irrigation. ' Potatoes and cotton are grown' extensively too an 1 a few apples and pears in the narrow jiver valleys farther west. But in general it is a range country somewhat similar to parts of our own state and those adjoining Nebraska on the west and north. Arizona stands out in my mind as containing huge lava beds the petrified forest, the painted desert, and the Grand Canyon, each of which indicates that many many years have passed since the ter - rian was a flat country. At one of these places, surely the slang phrase "Ain't Nature Grand", must have originated. But don't get the notion this country is all deseit, not by any means. In fact it rained on us every day until we git to Needles, California. Prom there to San Bernardino, however it is mostly desert, not because the soil won't grow anything, but father because the moisture is not available to support anything but desert plants. In fact most of southern California would be desert were it not for irrigation. California's citrus industry represents the bulk cf its agricul - tural income. The income per acre is higher than fir most other crops but likewise the cost of production is very high. Let us start Vith irrigation. The water in the Orange county district (which we (visited and .studied for about 15 days) comes mostly from deep wells. The fruit growers belong tpf cooperative irrigation districts which pump and distribute the water through underground :ement pipeß. Between each two tree rows on the high side of the orchard there is an upright cement pipe about 18 inches in diameter It has two short pieces of galvanized pipe sticking out at about the ground level Or slightly above. Over these short pipes; longer gal iranized pipes are slipped when it comes time to irrigate. These lot g pipes have sjlits in them and small gates to let the water out and tt regulate the flow. Most orange growers irrigate their groves about ev6ry six-weeks. IJain may supply the needs of the. trees in the wintei months but through the summer and fall it is always necessary to irrigate. ! Windbreaks are considered indispensable to keep tte hot winds from the desert from burning the southeast side of this trees. The most common windbreak tree is the eucalyptus which &lt; tows rapidly and to great heights. The trees are set about 4 feet apairt In a single </seg>
         <seg id="p490">HF.rORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE row. As the windbreak reaches au age of 25 or 30 years the lower side branches die and thentamarix is used to fill in the gaps below. In one area near Orange a windbreak made of lumber proved quite effective, though rather expensive. The frame work was built of 2"x6"s and Ix 4" were nailed to this with one inch gaps between. It extended to a height of 50 or 60 feet above the ground. One ad - vantage of this type of windbreak is that no space is lost for the windbreak and still another is that no irrigation water is used by it. One operation which is common in California that is not prac - ticed in Nebraska is orchard heating to prevent frost damage. The season of 19 36-3 7 brought a week of freezing weather to the orange groves which not only killed most of the blooms for the 1937 crop but also ruined a lot of oranges that were half grown at the time. The season of 1937 saw orange prices at very high levels as a re - sult and those growers who were equipped and used their equipment received as much as 52 per lug box for their oranges. The usual type of heater looks somewhat like a orooder lamp with a tank capacity of about 4 to 5 gallons. They cost $2.50 to $4.00 each. The heaters for a ten acre orchard represent an invest - ment of $1750.00 to $2500.00 and the oil to operate them for a single night may cost as much as $100. Some of the growers are now equipping their orchards with central pumping plants which pump the oil to burners attached to underground pipes among the trees. The citrus orchards have their share of pests, too. The princi - pal ones seem to be scale insects of three different colors, red, black, and purple. They are controlled by fumigating with cyanide gas or by spraying with miscible oils. Both of these operations are done on a custom basis by licensed spray companies. The picking, packing and marketing of citrus fruits in California is done largely through cooperative setups. The grower simply noti - fies his cooperative manager that he wants a portion of his crop picked and the manager sends the picking crew in with lug boxes and ladders to do the job. The oranges are taken to the packing house, washed, graded, packed, cooled, loaded on iced cars, and sent on their way to market. The sales organization looks after the selling all over the country. The growing of citrus fruits in California is a costly thing. First of all the cost of good citrus land is high, $1500 to $300,0 per acre. Irrigation water costs $20 to $35 per acre per season. Heat - ing may cost another $20, taxes are $10 to $20 per acre. Even barn - yard manure sell at such fancy figures,—4(? to s&lt;? per cublic foot.

There are a good many cars passing over these transcontinental highways in the summer. The pavements become slippery and greasy after a while, offering dangerous driving hazards, particularly on the steep grades and sharp curves. In a number of places along the highway we saw CCC boys putting up guards of galvanized iron sheets about 10 inches high. These guards stop the advance and they travel along the shallow trench back of the guard until they come to a sort of corral. This is an enclosure about 20 feet square surrounded by more of the galvanized iron strips. The entrance to this cricket corral is about 10 inches higher than the adjoining corral area and once they drop into it they can't climb out. After they have died they are shovelled into a pile in the center of the corral. In the area around Elko there were streches of road where there was one of these corrals every 700 feet and each one contained at least a truckload or two of dead crickets.

His subject is "Hardy Apple Stocks Make Long Lived and Productive Trees". Professor Lantz. PROP. LANTZ: Mr. Chairman, President Baker, Gentlemen. This morning I referred to the fact that we had two choices in plant - ing .new. orchards, insofar as increasing hardiness was concerned. We may select varieties with known hardiness or develop them by the use of hardy under stocks. HARDY STOCKS MAKE LONG LIVED AND PRODUCTIVE APPLE i "¦•. . . ¦¦•".. i •¦ .- .- ' V... :¦,¦.'¦ "¦. TREES.. ¦¦-¦¦¦.'• : / :. •¦ ; by ¦'¦ '¦•.:, H. L. Lantz lowa Agricultural Experiment Station At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the contributions and helpful suggestions made by my colleague, T. J. Maney, who initiated the project in hardy apple stocks at the lowa State Agricultural Ex - periment Station. Professor Maney has had direct kharge of this project and during the progress of these investigatidns has contri - buted a number of reports in regard to the use of hardy stocks. I am drawing freely from these reports and from .my long association with Professor Maney and the stocks project at Ames for this con - tribution to your meeting. Topworking of apple.trees has been actively practiced by fruit growers throughout the northern states. In lowa the practice of ; topworking was talked about by pioneer horticulturists more than fifty years ago. The Hibernal of Russian origin, and the Virginia Crab originated in eastern lowa by N. JC Fluke have been used by orchardists more extensively than any other stock variety, because of their hardiness, deep rooting habit, disease resistance, congeniality to a wide range of varieties, and the wide angled crotch structure of the scaffold branches where they join the main trunk. Because of these characteristics, these stocks may add 10 o 15 years to the life of topworked varieties under the climatic conditions which prevail in the Great Plains states. The stocks problem has been a. pertinent one with fruit growers for many years throughout the northern states, because of a climate which is characterized by extreme ranges of temperature and mois - ture. During the past eight years the Middlewest has been scorched by summer .heat and visited by intense winters of almost unprece - dented severity, and many trees have been Injured ami often killed </seg>
         <seg id="p496">liliVOliT OF XEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE outright. The winter of 1935-36 killed thousands of trees outright throughout the Upper Mississippi Valley, the Missouri Valley region, and in the states to the east of us. The winter of 1933-34 left a toll of several millions of dead trees in New York and the New Eng - land states. So wide spread has been the damage due to winter injury that fruit growers have searched for methods to "winter - proof" their fruit trees against the damages due to freezing. Prob - ably never in the history of American horticulture has there been such wide spread interest in the question of hardy under-stocks. It is felt in a good many sections that the method best employed to circumvent winter injury to apple trees is through the use of hardy stocks. There is considerable evidence that hardy stocks like Hiber - nal, Virginia Crab, Haas, Sheriff, and doubtless many other varieties, seedlings, or species when used in double-working will extend the life of apple trees a number of years as against trees grown by the usual method of budding or grafting. The record presented by Pro - fessor Maney of a twenty acre orchard planted in 1893 by D. W. Lotspiech at Woodbine, lowa, substantiates in a measure the bene - fits to be derived from the use of hardy stocks in double-working. In this orchard, root-graft trees of Jonathan, Grimes and Gano were planted. In addition, Hass, Sheriff, and Virginia Crab were planted as stocks and were stem grafted to the above named varieties. The comparative longevity of the topworked and nontopworked varieties is shown by the accompanying table. Table 1. Record of Topworked Apple Trees in W. P. Campbell Or - chard, Woodbine, lowa.

Grimes and Gano trees was materially extended as compared with the same varieties grown as root grafts on French Crat.

Comparatively few old treei of this variety nfTo^n iho e onmaJOrlty °£ the trees hiving gone out dLing the period of 1910-1920 as a result of drought, over-production and winter injury, which weakened the trees and made them susceptible to Blister Canker. During the forty years history of tL Lotspiech or - chard, the trees which .have survived have experienced all the vi - cissitudes of mid-western climate, which ranged from intense drought and summer heat to winter cold. This orchard no v owned by W P. Campbell still contains some of the topworked ;rees of Grimes and Jonathan that produced 30 to 40 bushels of fruit per tree dur - i ing crop years. Some of the best trees in this orchard are those worked on Sheriff and Haas. •.{. . Our midwestern apple orchards, as a general rile, reach their opt mum development in about 20 to 25 years and often deteriorate , rapid y after this. The record of the Lotspiech orchard, therefore is rather significant. In lowa, a number of orcha-dists began to iPlant Hibernal and Virginia Crab quite freely as intermediate stocks ,10 to 15 years ago. One of our most successful growers in western ,; lowa has made considerable use of Virginia Crab. He stated not i long ago, that a row of sixteen year old Golden Delicious trees top - j worked on Virginia Crab produced as many apples ill 1936 as four , comparable rows of the same variety root grafted Jn French Crab i; stock. Another grower in western lowa told me this fall that in her young orchard, which had just reached full bearing, practically i the entire crop which she harvested in 1937 was produced by the (trees topworked on Virginia Crab. One of our most progressive growers in south central lowa is a confirmed believer in Hibernal as a stock and is developing all of his new plantings by double-working on this stock. Following the winter of 1935-36, a great deal of winter Injury of one kind and another made itself apparent at the beginning of the growing season in 1936 and became more pronounced as the season progressed The • grower above referred to called our attention to sdme interesting compa,risons in his block of topworked trees. Accordingly, we made records and a number of observations in this orchard during the sum - mer of 1936. We found that where Stayman was limb grafted on iHibernal that the trees came through in good condition; whereas, (Stayman trees on French Crab iwere badly killed back in the ter - jminals and injured in the crotches. ; In another section of the or- </seg>
         <seg id="p498">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE chard, there were rows of six-year old trees (1936) of Jonathan and Turley, both of which were topworked on Hibernal on alternate trees during the summer of 1936. The topworked varieties of these var - ieties were outstanding in their freedom from winter injury and were making normal growth, while the trees, particularity Turley, on their own stems showed treminal killing ranging from severe to slight, and crotch injury was found to be present on every tree. Nine year old trees of Mclntosh in 1936 which were double-worked on Hibernal yielded eight times as much fruit as trees of Mclntosh on their own stems. All of the trees in this block of Mclntosh were loaded with bloom in the spring of 1936. There has been very little evidence to show thai double-working changes the hardiness of the tender variety which is topworked upon it, but this orchard amply demonstrates that a hardy stock may increase the hardiness of the topworked variety as measured by the resistance of the terminal twig growth to winter injury and by the resistance of the fruit buds to winter injury. The Indiana Agricultural Experiment Station secured some own - rooted trees of the Virginia Crab from an lowa nursery in 1919. These trees were topworked to Grimes and Ben Davis and planted along with the same varieties in other combinations in which .root grafts on French Crab were included. The varieties on Virginia Crab have made better trees than those grown as root grafted on the French Crab seedlings. Wherever Grimes is grown, collar rot has been responsible for serious losses in trees just reaching full production. Under lowa conditions, Virginia Crab, Hibernal, Haas, and Sheriff are resistant to collar rot and to crotch and body injury due to winter tempera - tures. Blister Canker infections on Gano topworked on Sheriff have been observed to stop at the line of union. In the middle west, Blister Canker has done a tremendous amount of damage in bearing orchards. Generally speaking, topworking has been practiced mainly as a hobby by amateur fruit growers here and there throughout the colder parts of the United States. However, during the last five to eight years, commercial grower in all parts of the country have awakened to the fact that this practice may have extensive application. The result is that there has been a great deal of inquiry from growers as to which stocks may be used with the various varieties. In order to answer these questions, we have attempted to summarize the avail - able information relative to the suitability of various stocks to stand - ard varieties. This summary Is based on data which has accumu - lated during the past 25-30 years and is based on experimental evi - dence, on observations by the pomology staff at lowa State College, </seg>
         <seg id="p499">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY and upon replies to questionnaires sent at various; times to fruit growers throughout the United States and Canada. The reports of the state horticultural societies of the northern states also contain valuable information in connection with stocks. In summarizing these stocks studies, it was found that either the Hibernal or the Virginia Crab have been successfully used as stocks for many important apple varieties. Some of the more direct evidence in the compatability of various varieties to different stocks has been derived from [the variety and j; stock orchards now growing In the experimental orchard at Ames. ;¦;• In 1924, a twenty-acre tract of land was planted to nine rows of forty trees each to Hibernal and to ten rows, forty.trees each, to Virginia Crab. These were topworked by budding in late August, 1925, to the varieties, Willow, Delicious, Grimes Golden, Jonathan^ Hawkeye : Greening, Norwel, Edgewood, and Sharon (2 rows]. These same varieties, therefore, appear on both stocks in equal numbers. The odd row of Virginia Crab was budded to Joan. In a Bummary state - ment, it can be stated that the trees of all the varieties with the exception of Grimes and Starking have made larger trees, have come into fruiting earlier, and to date have been 50% to :.00% more pro - ductive than those trees topworked on Hibernal. We are inclined to believe that Delicious, Grimes Golden, and Willow are better adapted to growing on the Hibernal stock than on the Virginia Crab stock, but the trees of Jonathan, Edgewood, Sharon, Hawkdye, and Norwel worked on Virginia Crab have made better growth aid to date have been more productive than are the same varieties on the Hibernal. Virginia Crab has produced so'ine peculiar reactions. It very definitely dwarfs some members of the Winesap group. Stayman makes very weak growth on the Virginia Crab, and at Ames the fruit fails to mature properly and has poor size ana color. Mam - moth Black Twig is decidely dwarfed, yet the branch and twig growth is healthy and the fruit is normal in all respeits. The trees, .]• too, have been very productive. Paragon on Virginia Crab makes a very vigorous fine growing and productive tree. Its vigor on Vir - ginia Crab distinguishes it as a distinct variety not to be confused with the Mammoth Black Twig. Turley does well on Virginia Crab. This has been found at Ames and also in western lowa. Winesap is , at least half dwarfed and does not make a very desirable tree. ; Double-working primarily is the fruit grower's job. Trees of Hibernal and Virginia Crab must be propagated in th i ordinary way by nurserymen. Both varieties can be planted as o;ie of 'two-year old trees and should be allowed to develop a framework in order to ' utilize the wide angle crotcheß of the stocks. This may require two seasons' growth in the orchard. The trees may be topworked by </seg>

         <seg id="p502">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE budding or by grafting. The buds should be placed as far out from the trunk on the scaffold branches as possible. Trees on these stocks make execllent growth and large size, so that little or no time is lost so far as bringing the trees to bearing size and age is concerned. In fact, topworked orchards are likely to come into production earlier than the same varieties growing on their own stems. The question is often asked whether it is possible to grow seed - ling trees from the Virginia Crab and Hibernal to be used as stocks The answer is definitely "No". These varieties are not diploids and for this reason, when seeds of these varieties are planted thef ger - minate very poorly and the seedlings that do grow make a very poor, weak growth. North lowa and Minnesota nurserymen have utilized to a very good advantage seeds from the hardy varieties grown in that section, such as, Wealthy, Malinda, Duchess, Patten Greening and others. in our experiments at Ames, seedlings of these and other varieties have been grown. These produced fruit stocks of excellent growth which proved to be far hardier than French Crab seedlings when permitted to remain in the nursery row over a period of several years. Topworking hardy stocks is not a difficult procedure. It is a means of building hardier, longer lived and .more productive trees in the case of our best commercial varieties. The extra expense invol - ved is not great, but the money thus spent is money well invested. MR. HOPPERT: In this territory, would you say that the Vir - ginia Crab was not so good? MR. LANTZ: Varying soil types may have some effect on the stock you select. From our experience with Virginia Crab on a number of soil types, loess included, we favor it, but our soils may not be entirely comparable with yours. FRANK SIM: The Harrison county soil is practically the same as on our side of the river, isn't it? PROF. LANTZ; Yes. I think it would be much the same. The whole stock problem, as I see it, has many angles How - ever enough favorable experience has been encountered so that a great deal of interest is being shown by growers in Indiana, Illinois Ohio, and our own state. With reference to Grimes; .hardy stock will elliminate all loss due to collar rot and that is a big item with Grimes. MR. HOPPERT: What stock would you suggest for Missouri river bottom soils?

BAKER: Thank you again, Professor Lantz, for your very worth while discussion. I will now have the secretary present the resolutions relative to the marketing of cull apples that were discussed this morning by Professor Lantz before we take up our next paper and we will have a vote on it at this time. Reading of resolutions by E. H. Hoppert, Secretary. MR. HOPPERT: In other words, what we want to vote on here is "Be it resolved that Federal legislation be passed to keep apple culls out of interstate commerce except where definitely consigned to by-product plants". Motion was made, seconded and carried that the resolution be adopted. R. KIMMEL: I would like to ask Mr. Bare a question. The time was so short this morning. What would you recommend in ordinary sanitation to control leaf miner? MR. BARE: About the only thing is the destruction of trash in the orchard. As I mentioned this morning, this is an open question since many times that is not advisable for other reasons. D. BAKER: Does anyone else have anything to say about this? MR. HOPPERT: This insect seems to go in waves. We will have a bad infestation one year and then the next year the. parasites or natural enemies flourish and keep it down for several seasons. Mr. Baker of St. Joseph reported that In those blocks sprayed with nicotine in control of codling moth early In the season, It seems to be easily controlled. There seems to be no definite time for that spray. It can be combined with the first codling moth spray or used later. </seg>
         <seg id="p507">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY D. BAKER: Are there any other questions that you would like to take up at this time? I think the conservation of moisture is one of the most important items we have in the growing of trees. We have tried cultivation, mulching, and every method known up to the present. Perhaps in: the future new developments will take place and I am sure we will all be ready to try them out. It comes time now for the fruit growers problems. We have been discussiong them a little from time to time all day but if there are any new problems which anyone would like to have discussed at this time, we would be glad to have them brought up. MB. HOPPERT: A short time ago I got a letter from one of the nurseries in lowa saying they had quite a surplus of Virginia Crab stock.

If you have places in your orchard where you have winter injury, perhaps on the lower ground, I think it would pay to go to the extra trouble. You would get a highly productive tree in place of a weak, poorly producing one. V' r\'V Mr. Banning lost many of his trees from winter injury on the low, wet ground a-few years back. V </seg>
         <seg id="p508">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE D. BAKER: This top working doesn't overcome sunscald, does it? PROF. LANTZ: No, but it would help considerably. R. KLMMEL: Where you irrigate up to the first of September, wouldn't the effect be the same as if trees were planted on low ground? DR. WIGGANS: We put on the equivalent of two inches late in November. It was a dry fall and it tended to harden up the wood and prevent winter injury. If we have lots of cloudy, foggy weather in the fall, it leaves the tissues susceptible to winter injury. D. BAKER: I thought someone would present the idea of try - ing to revive some farm of legislation this winter on the grade law. Would you care to discuss that a little at this time? Is the Society willing to sponsor that bill again? DR. WIGGANS: If the cull proposition is put into operation again, what effect would that have? D. BAKER: It would have an influence. MR. HOPPERT-. Along that line, I read an interesting article from an eastern Horticultural Society. A Mr. Sherman, in charge of shipping point inspection for the U. S. Department of Agriculture, spoke. He said perhaps you are barking up the wrong tree. Per - haps you should raise more culls for that seems to be the apple that is in demand. More people can buy the lower priced apples than the high grade apples. If people can't buy the better apples, then give them what they can buy. It costs money to spray and .raise high grade apples. It is something to think about. When you go into grading of apples, you make them .more ex - pensive. I think there has been and always will be a demand for a certain proportion of high quality apples but there is a larger de - mand for apples of a poorer quality. MR. EVANS: I know a gentleman near Jefferson City who has 100 acres of apples and Is just a medium grower, I should say. He told me he sold his apples In a "family bushel". When I asked what he meant by that, he said "Small apples for the small kids; big apples for the bigger kids, and some nice ones for the company". He seems to be making money doing it that way. Considerable discussion followed among various members of the Society with regard to getting a bill before the next session of the legislature but no definite action was taken.

FIELD SHELTEBBELTS Eleven million trees have been planted in 1,516 miles of field shelterbelts on 2,587 far.ms in 33 counties in Nebraska. This plant - ing was done under the direction of the Prairie States Forestry Pro - ject, a division of the U. S. Forest service in the Department of Agriculture. The first planting -was done in the Spring of 1935 when 22 miles were established. There has been a steady increase in the demand for shelterbelts ever since the first tree was planted. Last year, the Spring of 1938, the Forest service planted 1006.6 miles on 1,725 farms which will probably be the maximun load for one plant - ing season. Present plans call for the planting of 1000 miles in the Spring of 1939 for which applications for more than 500 miles have already been received. . I : ' - : -" '. -I The shelterbelts are planted by the Forest Service in co-operation with the landowners. The landowners assume over 50% of the cost of establishing the plantings by: furnishing the land and preparing it for planting, furnishing fence material for enclosing the trees, carry - ing out rodent control measures, and cultivating the trees. The land - owners receive no pay from the Forest Service for any of these items. The Forest Service furnishes the trees, plants them, builds the fence out of material furnished by the landowner, furnishes poison for control o£ rodents, and gives supervision in the j future mainten - ance of the plantings. ¦;¦ ¦' The survival of the trees planted in the shelterbelts has been ex - ceptionally good considering the severe drouths of! the past four years and the fact that the trees are never watered! In 1935 over 80% of the seedlings lived and even in the extreme drouth year of 1936 slightly more than 50% of the trees survived. Over 77% of the trees planted in 1937 are alive and growing. A survival count of the trees planted in 1938 is now being made andllt appears that it will be well over 7ft%. In a great many of the|l937 plantings more than 95% of the trees were alive at the end of the growing season.

Trees were planted in Ihe spring of 11)35. The shelterbelts are planted on cultivated land to prevent soil from blowing, to conserve moisture, to protect crops from hot winds, to produce fuel and post, to provide cover and food for game and in - sectivorous birds, and to improve the aeshetic value of the Plains States. The shelterbelts, as now planted, contain ten rows of trees, except on irrigated land where 5 rows are planted, with the trees X feet apart in the row. The rows are either 8 or 10 feet apart de - pending on the type of soil. Drouth resistant trees are used. The chief species being: hackberry, American elm, cottonwood, Chinese elm, ash, honey locust, walnut, burr oak, yellow pine, Austrian pine, red cedar, mulberry, Russian olive, chokecherry, plum, and caragana. Seed is collected from trees growing in the shelterbelt area. It is then grown far one or two years in one of the Forest Service nurser - ies at Fremont, Norfolk, North Platte, or Halsey and then replanted as seedlings approximately 20 inches tall, into the field shelterbelts. The entire state of Nebraska is eligible for shelterbelt plantings however, at the present time plantings are being concentrated in four areas with District Offices at Norfolk, Neligh, Alliance and Loup City.

Livestock is Nebraska's most important asset. If Nebraska is to retain her high rank in the nation as a livestock state it is im - perative that the crops raised on Nebraska farms be marketed on the hoof. Beef cattle, hogs, and sheep are three most important kinds of livestock capable of converting hay and grain into market - able products. Horses and mules live upon farm-produced feeds, the same as do the other kinds of livestock, but instead of turning these feeds into meat, wool, milk, butter, etc., they convert the roughages and grains into farm power. It has been estimated that it requires the crops from 4 acres of good corn belt farm land to maintain one draft horse for a year. </seg>
         <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION ¦"¦¦•' •'.¦ ' . '•¦ I From January 1, 1934 to January 1, 1938 the horse numbers declined in Nebraska from 749,000 to 584,000, a total of 165,000 head. Under normal conditions this means that since 1934 the'crops from 660,000 acres of Nebraska's farm land must find a new outlet. Pages have been •written on the relative merits of the tractor and the horse as sources of economical-farm power. While it is not my intention to debate the horse vs. tractor issue in this short talk, I do feel that the Nebraska farmer should face the facts and give the horse and mule some serious consideration as a source of farm power before dooming him to oblivion. Farm horses and mules utilize rough - age raised on Nebraska farms most efficiently. To use the gasoline and fuel oils produced in Texas, Oklahoma and other states on Nebraska farms instead of the cheap roughages and grains raised on these farms to produce drawbar power will not help solve our farm problems. I am reminded here of an incident that happened not so long ago in the central part of the state. A farmer owned six good horses, four of which were good brood mares. This particular farmer traded these four mares as-part payment on a new tractor and kept the team of geldings. A short time later a friend remarked to him, "Since you kept the geldings and traded off the brood mares, what are you going to use as a part payment on your next tractor?" A good pair of brood mares are capable of raising about three colts every two years. Since six good work horses are capable of taking care of the drawbar power on the average 200-acre farm, it can readily be seen that the same pair of brood mares; in. four years' time are capable of producing sufficient replacements for the average Nebraska farm. Outside of a 10-day period after foaling, these mares can take their regular turn in! the field, on the feed wagon, or at other farm jobs, thereby paying for their feed and care. : V : / -I-- ¦• : ¦:¦ Colts may be raised as cheaply on the Nebraska farm as in any other state in the Union. Nebraska raises an abundance of prairie hay which is considered to be one of the best roughages for growing colts. The past few years have caused the Nebraska farmer and stockmen to realize the necessity of planting a part of his acreage to sorghums, both forage and grain. Good bright forage (sorghum is an excellent roughage for the growing colt or the working horse. There is an abundance of good pasture land that the colt may graze upon during the summer and the cornstalk field and straw pile alao furnish a part of the winter ration at a very low cost. Draft colts meed very little grain after their first winter. Oats are con - sidered the standard grain for the draft horse. : Grains such as corn, grain; sorghums, barley, and other farm-raised grains may be sub- </seg>
         <seg id="p518">KKI'OKT UV NEBRASKA STATIC BOARD OF AGRICI/LTL-RE stftuted, either in part or entirely for oats. The colt that receives 750 pounds of grain his first winter, mainly oats, along -with sufficient good quality roughage, will need very little if any more grain until he is taken up the winter or spring he is coming three to be broken and trained to go to work. A good colt may be worked the spring and summer he is three, provided he is reasonably well grown out, is given reasonably good care, and is not required to do some of the more strenuous jobs required of his older brother. The work horse should be fed for maximum efficiency. The amount of grain he is to be fed will depend entirely upon the amount of work he Is required to do. As the work increases the amount of grain should be increased and the roughage decreased. A good pas - ture for the work horse to run on during the night and on Sundays and holidays helps materially in cutting down the cost of horse labor. Idle horses require very little care. During the summer a good pasture is the best place for the idle draft horse. In the winter months the cornstalk field and straw pile will go a long ways toward maintaining him in fair flesh. Of course he will need some better quality roughage or a little grain or its equivalent as a supplement to cornstalks and straw. It is false economy to allow the idle horse to become too thin and weak during the winter as it takes consider - able more feed to get a thin horse in shape for spring work than is required to shape up the horse that has been maintained in fair flesh. There has been and probably will continue to be a fairly good market for the well-broke five to eight-year-old sound farm chunk - type horse, and shapely, medium-sized mule. Thus the farmer who works and raises a few good horses or mules not only has the oppor - tunity to convert some of his cheap roughages and grains into econ - omical power but also can raise his own replacements and each year sell a few of the older well-broke horses or mules at a fair profit. I well realize that in this era of speed, when we can whiz to town in a streamlined automobile on a paved highway at 60 miles per hour that it seems rather slow to ride through the cornfield behind 4 horses at 2% miles per hour. However I am wondering if the saving of time is the most important factor to consider if Ne - braska farmers are to again enjoy a prosperous living. I believe that the farmer who grows his own power so that he will not have to sell cheaply the fuel he raises in order to buy dearly the fuel with which he tills the soil, has taken a step in the right direction toward building a sound farm program. </seg>
         <seg id="p519">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION CASHING GRASS AND ROUGHAGE THRU A COW HERD R. A. SPENCE, Crab Orchard i Most of you people have had .some experience in feeding and handling livestock. Some of you may have a herd of beet cows on your farm at the present time. . I am sure you will all agree that "A Cow Herd" is a fitting topic for discussion on a program featuring the use of roughage. We have sixty angus breeding cows on our .home farm about fifty miles southeast from here. \ About half the cows are purebred registered angus and the others are high grade angus. These cattle are owned by my father and myself together. They are handled on a practical basis and have made some money during the'past few years of depression and! short crops. In order to handle beef cows successfully on Nebraska farms, it is necessary that the annual carrying cost per head be kept at a minimum. It is impossible to keep a cow a year under general farm belt conditions for the same cost that a cow can be carried in the Nebraska sandhills. However, beef cows can be handled profitably under general farming conditions and they do afford an excellent means of converting roughage and pasture into dollars and cents. I believe there is a place for the beef cow on many Nebraska farms. Factors contributing to the cost of maintaining beef breeding cows and raising calves include the cost of pasture, winter feeding, labor, mortality risk on both cow and calf, service of sire, interest and depreciation on equipment as well as interest and taxes on cow. The total cost of these items will figure $25 to $30 per calf on most farms in Nebraska. In southeast Nebraska, it will cost $8 to $10 to carry a cow during the pasture season. lam figuring a 7% to eight months pasture season which is entirely possible and basing my costs on present land values. It costs about one-half as much to carry a cow a month on grass as it does to feed her a month during the winter. Therefore, we try to lengthen the grazing season and shorten the winter feeding period. We let the cow do as much work as possible in getting her own feed. A cow can be wintered 4 or 4% months for about $8 to $10 or approximately the same total cost for wintering as for pasturing although the cost per month for wintering will be about twice as much or maybe a little more. We can feed a couple of tons of silage, a little cotton cake, and the balance straw and cornstalks and get the cow thru the winter, for $8 or $10. The total annual feed cost amounts to $16 to $20 per cow and figuring mortality risk on cows and about a normal percentage of calves will add $3. or $4. .more plus interest in value of cow at 6 percent equals $3 or $4, service of sire $1 and a little something for equipment. The </seg>
         <seg id="p520">I'.Ki'OHT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICL'LTL'KE cost now figures $23 to $29 and it you allow anything for the hired man, it will cost $25 to $30 to raise a beef calf to weaning time on Nebraska farms. I have not given credit for .manure produced on the farm because my carrying costs maybe rather conservative. Costs will vary from year to year with prices of feed and roughage, but over a period of. years $25 to $30 will insure a good beef calf of weaning age. Lei us remember that this cost includes a fair market value on rough feeds such as stalk fields, corn and sorgo fodder, ensilage, and straw, that are difficult to sell. Some of these roughages frequently have little market value. Beef cows and calves furnish a market on the farm for this roughage as well as grain produced. Assuming that $25 to $30 is the cost of producing a beef calf to weaning time, it becomes apparent that the production of beef calves like many other farm enterprises is conducted on a narrow margin of profit. The farmer must produce a quality beef calf that Is worth more than $25 or $30. Choice quality calves weighing 375 to 425 pounds will cost approximately $35 to $40 per head over a period of years laid into the farmers feed lot after paying freight and other necessary costs. A good beef type bull is essential to the production of choice quality calves. Tests conducted by the Missouri Experiment Station and the U.S.D.A. at Sni-A-Bar Farms, Grain Valley, Mo., show that calves sired by a good purebred bull are worth $2 per hundred more at weaning time than calves out of similar cows sired by nondescriptor mediocre bulls. A good bull can be purchased at a moderate p.rice. The right kind of bull will also increase the quality and market value of your breeding herd since it will be poss - ible to retain cows of superior beef type that should be worth .more money than the original foundation cows. Raising your own calves reduces the speculative element In beef production and affords a degree of insurance against weather hazards. It is possible to store a reserve supply of feed on the farm through the trench silo, proper management of pastures, and the loan features of the Ever-Normal-Granary program. A good herd of regular producing beef cows will produce a crop of calves each year regardless of hot weather or lack of rain-fall. They will provide a steady income from one year to the next. The "in and out" stock farmer is sometimes "in" when he should be "out" and "out" when he should be in". The cow and calf farmer will be "in' 1 every year. He can store reserve feed supplies to carry him through years of short crops. Short crop years are generally the years that beef cattle prices are the best. One further advantage Is that the livestock farmer must balance his farming operations thru </seg>
         <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION larger acreages of forage crops. Hence, the cow and calf farmer has the advantage of a balanced farm program that will insure greater returns per acre in drouth years. Since 1934 especially we have learned the value of drouth resistant crops such as sorghums These crops can be grown and cashed thru'a cow herd in years when the same acreage of corn or other grains might produce little or nothing. , ;. We have not creep fed our calves each year but one of the advantages in keeping a cow herd is this possibility. Calves can be started on grain while suckling their mothers with little or no set-back at weaning time. The calves will retain their baby fat and gain more efficiently than those shipped considerable distances at weaning time and started on grain sometime later. There are some risks in buying calves and shipping them. It was necessary to send our cows away on August 13 1934 because of the drouth. Everything burned up, we raised no grain, and had a very limited amount of sorghum roughage that year. We had a creep for the calves where they might get alfalfa hay and a mixture of oats and corn. These calves were only four to five months old when the cows were taken away, but they had been started on grain and alfalfa and came along in extra good shape. The steer calves brought $12.50 per hundred and the heifers $11.00 per hundred or slightly more than $100.00 each in Omaha the following April when a year-old and weighing 835 pounds each. Incidentally, we had a crib of corn on hand that had been sealed and carried over as a result of the corn loan or Ever-Normal-Granary Program. The proceeds from the calves paid the wintering costs on the cows and gave us a good price for the corn. The drouth of 1934 was almost a disaster for farmers in large areas of Nebraska bui our cows and calves lost less money than anything else on the farm that year. lam not so sure that they. really lost any money. Our beef cattle .management plans are changed somewhat from one year to the next. This winter the cows will have sorghum fodder corn stalks, straw, and winter pasture when the grass is not covered with snow. They will probably receive a pound of cotton cake dur - ing two or three months of the worst winter weather and a mineral mixture to furnish the calcium that is lacking in the roughages These cows are still grazing in our native pasture. Part of them are about four miles from home and will be left there until the weatherman brings snow. ; &gt;.'¦¦ We have used a trench silo during the past two winters. Last winter we fed some cotton cake, about 40 lbs. of silage daily, together with free access to straw stacks and made some use of stalk fields. </seg>
         <seg id="p522">KKI'uKT (IF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We wintered one group of cows on four or five pounds of oats daily, a little cotton cake, wheat straw, and grass that they grazed during the winter with no silage, corn stalks, fodder or hay. Feed costs of wintering these cows was about $2 or $3 each per month. They came thru in good shape, had good calves, and were wintered for less money than if they had received a full feed of silage. These cows had no protection other than a straw stack during the winter. We do not have shed space for all our cows and find that a good straw stack is about all that a black cow needs. We have sheds for the young stock. There are various ways of handling calves produced from beef cows. A cow and calf system permits a lot of flexibility. Some men may creep feed the calves, others may prefer to carry the calves on a deferred plan and fatten them as yearlings or two year olds or it may be possible to market the increase as feeder cattle. We have fed very little grain to cattle the past few years, but have used them to consume grass and roughage. We have sold quite a few calves each fall for feeding and breeding purposes and have been able to sell yearlings to fairly good advantage off of grass or after getting a limited grain ration. With a return to normal weather conditions, we shall probably feed out more of our own cattle and hope to dis - pose of the top individuals for breeding purposes. I should like to mention briefly the possibilities of crossing good purebred beef type bulls on milk cows. It is not necessary to keep a herd of purebred beef cows. In fact many farmers may have some cross-bred cows or dairy cows that they wish to use for the pro - duction of calves for feeding purposes. The University of Wis - consin, Department of Animal Husbandry, has a three-year test on fattening cross-bred angus-holstein calves. They recommend full feed - ing the calves and selling them at 12 to 15 months of age. The picture of the calves used in their test shows them all to be black. A holstein man would think they were purebred angus. The results of this experiment may be obtained by writing the College of Agri - culture at Madison, Wisconsin. The possibilities of cashing grass and roughage thru a Cow Herd will necessarily depend somewhat on your own particular farm lay - out. Good pastures are essential to handling beef cows economically. We are fortunate in having about 50 percent of our farm acreage in good native and blue grass pastures. Ordinarily about 10 to 15 percent of the crop land is kept in temporary pasture, hay or con - serving crops, 10 to 15 percent in forage sorghums, 20 to 30 percent is used for corn, 20 to 30 percent for wheat, 10 to 15 percent is used for barley or rye for grain, and 5 to 10 percent is being used for grain sorghums. </seg>
         <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Farmers should figure the carrying capacity of their pastures in such a manner that there is more grass than they know what to do with during June. Instead of worrying what to do with the grass at that time, let it alone and you won't need to worry about the cattle during August. We utilize temporary pastures such as sweet clover in order that our permanent pasture may build a reserve supply of feed, and rest the permanent pastures or reduce the numbers of cattle on them during the time that the temporary pastures are good. Locking the pasture gate is one of the best practices that can be followed In rehabilitating native grass pastures. A cover of grass during the winter will catch the snow and hold the spring rains. Pastures should never be grazed so close but what part of the grasses will seed. We leave the cows in the pasture until snow covers the grass. Ordinarily this will be sometime after Thanks - giving. There will be enough old grass carried over that the cows can graze some during the winter and be turned out in April on the cured grasses from the previous year together with the new spring - growth. This gives a 4% months winter and a 7% months grazing season. In fact, our winter feeding period has been shortened to less than four months in two or three of the past ten years. In concluding I should like to reemphasize that beef cows and calves will furnish a good market for roughage and grass produced on the farm. There are possibilities of lowering the annual feed costs through participation in the farm program. Raising calves at home can insure a quality of product that is difficult to purchase. The speculative element in beef production is reduced. A cow and call system permits a lot of flexibility in cattle operations. The cow is a natural soil builder. Much fertility is lost when hay or roughage is sold from the farm. And beefj calf production or any other form of livestock farming will mean beiter balanced farms conservation of the soil, and a more prosperous Nebraska Agriculture. USING ROUGHAGE JOHN SCHEVE, Jansen, Nebraska Roughage has come to be a very important feed on my farm. It has given me good results and I will try and give you a few figures to back up my statements. ' ' ;.•'. -\ In the fall of 1935 I bought 46 heifer calves paying ?6.25 per hundred. The calves were wintered on oat straw, sorgo fodder, 2 pounds alfalfa hay and I pound of oats per day. In the spring they were put on pasture where they remained for 100 days. I then put them in the feed lot for 60 days where they were fed a ration of </seg>
         <seg id="p524">UKI'uRT OF XKBRAKKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE chopped oat hay, 2 pounds alfalfa, 3 pounds corn, 1 pound cottonseed cake and 1 pound of molasses per day. These heifers paid out or returned me $10 per ton for oat hay, $15 for alfalfa, $10 for sorgo fodder, ?35 for cottonseed meal, 81) cents per bushel on corn and $30 per ton for molasses. They also paid $4 per acre for pasture. Over this period of 300 days I received a gain of 360 pounds per animal. These heifers were marketed in Kansas City where they sold within 25 cents of the lot next to them that had been fed corn and alfalfa. In the fall of 1936 I bought 95 head of mixed heifers and steers for an average price of $5.00 per .hundred pounds. This group was wintered on the same ration as the first group and they were then placed on pasture. The summer of 1936 was very dry and consequently we had a shorter pasture season, yet they returned $3.50 per acre for the time they were there. Some time in August my pasture failed and I placed my cattle in the feed lot where they were fed a period of from 30 to 110 days. They were on a full feed of ground Atlas sorgo fodder, cottonseed cake, 3 pounds a day of sweet clover hay, and also molasses. I sold these cattle as they were finished, picking out a small group from time to time. The average price I received for all 95 head was about $6.75. I have found that by raising plenty of roughage and Utilizing it in the form of beef more profit can be made than by feeding corn and alfalfa to feeders. PASTUHE A2VD ROUGHAGE IN FATTENING RATIONS MARVEL L. BAKER, North Platte, Nebr. In the beginning, I wish to narrow my discussion somewhat I know that there are many different kinds of cattle which are fattened for market, and that there are many different kinds of pastures and roughages. I wish to discuss the use of pasture and roughage under western Nebraska conditions, in the production of finished yearlings of good to choice quality. As a general thing, it should be planned to market such cattle during the summer, fall, and early winter, and they should be well finished. The entire feeding period is a long one covering from nine to as much perhaps as sixteen months. </seg>
         <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS.'AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' I think I can discuss the problem better by referring principally to practices which we have followed at North Plattej hoping that there may be something in the general plan which -will be of interest. We start with what we hope are good quality calves. We have bought these as early as the latter part of September and as late as November. Many people of course buy them later believing that the added age of the-calves and the winter weights are advantageous. We start these calves as carefully as we can on prairie hay and a limited amount of some bulky) concentrate. As soon ias the calves are well-weaned and eating well, we begin to work them over to a ration of alfalfa or silage or both and a little grain. 1 If silage is fed, we also add cottonseed cake or soybean oil meal. Through the winter we try to feed these calves to gain from -1% t0.1% pounds per .head daily We try also to feed them so they carry considerable flesh in the spring, because at least in the case of steer calves, it is difficult to get them fat by the time we wish to market them unless they are in|good condition in thejspring. Calves should gain this amount and be in good fleshlin the spring if they are given a full feed of any of the palatable roughages and a limited amount of grain. We have fed as much as 6.0 pounds of grain and as little as 3.0. It is probable that calves should-be fea at least 4.0 pounds of grain per! head per day under thfis system of feeding. If the roughage is silage, wild hay, or other carbonaceous roughage, it should be fed with either about 4.0 pounds of alfalfa or some protein supplement. We have used one pound of either cotton - seed cake or meal, soybean oil.meal or linseed meal, or; 2/ 3 pound of tankage. If alfalfa hay is depended upon to supply the protein for a ration based on silage, the silage should be restricted so the calves will eat about 4.0 pounds of alfalfa per day. If both silage and alfalfa are full-ted, about i/ 3 of a pound of cottonseed cake or similar supplement should be added. Otherwise the calves will restrict their consumption of alfalfa to less than 3;0 pounds and will receive less protein than they can use to advantage. I should like to give you some typical wintering rations which we have used. : I '- ' . ¦'.¦/: " ¦ ..-¦¦': ¦'¦' . "¦'•' " - '¦'.:¦ ' '-I In one winter when corn and alfalfa were relatively cheap, we fed calves an average of almost; 6.0 pounds of corn and about 11 pounds of alfalfa hay. These calves gained 300 pounds per head in 175 days and ate 18 bushels of corn and 1 ton of alfalfa hay. In other words, each 100 pounds of gain required 6 bushels of corn and 1/3 ton of alfalfa hay. i </seg>
         <seg id="p526">UKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In another winter, we fed calves 2 tons of silage, &amp; ton of alfalfa and 3.0 bushels of corn per head. These calves gained 250 pounds per head in 168 days and each 100 pounds of gain required % ton of silage, about i/ 6 ton of alfalfa and U/o bushels of corn. In still another winter, the calves gained 323 pounds in 196 days. These calves were wintered largely on silage and were of course fed a protein supplement. Each calf ate 6.6 bushels of corn 2.6 tons of silage, i/ 5 ton of alfalfa hay, and about 165 pounds of cottonseed meal or soybean oil meal. To put on 100 pounds of gain, these calves ate just about 2 0 bushels of corn, about *i s tons of silage, i/ 20 ton of alfalfa and about 50 pounds of either cottonseed meal or soybean oil meal. You will see from these figures that with the prices which ordinarily prevail in our territory, that feeds may be marketed at good prices in this way and still leave the calves much cheaper in the spring than in the fall. For example, this year if we winter calves on corn and alfalfa as in the first example given you, and if we get similar results we can figure the calves into the lot at ?10.00, corn at 40 cents, and alfalfa at $6.00, and have the calves cost us $7.60 the first of next May. This of course is not figuring anything for risk, interest labor etc., but it is figuring a good price for both calves and feed. In the last example given you with silage as the principal rough - age fed, if we figure the calves into the lot at $10.00 corn at 40 cents, silage at $2.50. alfalfa at $6.00 and cottonseed meal at ?33 00 the calves will figure for feed and original cost an average cost of just about J7.00 next spring. Again, based on our own experience, these calves may be handled in any one of several different ways during the summer. (1) They may be grazed without grain for about 90 days and then fed in dry lot. If this practice is followed, the steers should be fed for about 150 days. This will send them to market about the first of the year. Steers fed in this way should make about 500 pounds gain based on feed lot weights and will eat from 45 to 50 bushels of corn plus a little more than % ton of alfalfa. If good grass is available, the steers may be started on feed while still on grass and may be fed on grass for about two months before being moved to dry lot. This will cut the amount of hay required. This method will ordinarily produce the cheapest gains of any of the methods de - scribed, but puts the cattle on the market after Christmas </seg>
         <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION (2) A second method which may be followed is to feed the steers a half feed of grain for about 90 days on grass and then feed them about 120 days in dry lot. This will put them on the market about December 1. Such steers should gain about 470 pounds, and will eat about 50 bushels of corn plus almost % ton of alfalfa. Again, if good grass is available, the feed of grain may be increased while the steers are still on grass, and the dry lot period shortened by from one to two .months. Each 100 pounds of gain made under this method of feeding requires about 1 bushel more corn and about 40 pounds less alfalfa hay than the first method described. (3). A third method which we have used is to full-feed steers on native grass for about 90 days, and then feed them in dry lot for about the same length of time, j This puts the cattle on the market about November l. Such cattle should gain about 425 pounds and will eat between 50 and 55 bushels of corn plus about 1/3 ton of alfalfa hay per head. One hundred pounds of gain will require about 2 bushels more corn and about 40 pounds less hay than the second method described or about 3 bushels more corn and about 80 pounds less hay than the first method. As far as we have been able to tell from selling price and from slaughter data which we have secured, there is very little difference in the market desirability of cattle produced under these three methods. L ' The method of use depends on) a number of considerations. The time at which it is wished to market the cattle, the weight of the cattle on May 1, and the relative price of grain and hay and pasture all enter in. For the man who is feeding several loads of cattle, a combination of all three methods may often be used to advantage. The heavier cattle may be sorted off and full-fed on grass, a second cut may be half-fed on grass, and the lighter cattle may be grazed without grain before putting them in the lot. This allows a person to send cattle to market about the same weight and finish over a comparatively long marketing period. If one wishes to still further lengthen the period over which he markets his cattle, he may introduce still another variation. Instead of cutting his cattle three ways, he may sort them four jways. In doing this, he can take the heaviest; cattle out in February or March and bring them up to full-feeding, leaving them in dry lot. These cattle can go to market probably in September. 'I For feeding while on grass, we have used corn, oats, xye, and molasses. All of these have been satisfactory, as long as | the cattle were on half feed. If the cattle are full-fed I should prefer to have </seg>
         <seg id="p528">RKf'oRT OF XEBIIASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICL'LTrRi: at least some corn in the ration. During the first 60 to 90 days on grass, we have had very little advantage from feeding cake, but 1 believe if cattle are to be fed on grass after July 15 or August 1, the addition of 1.0 pound of cake, either cottonseed or soybean will prove to be good practice. Another method of pasture feeding which I wish to call to your attention is that of feeding the kind of cattle I have been discussing on alfalfa pasture. Our general practice is to take the well-wintered calves, bring them up to about a 2/ 3 feed of grain and then put them on alfalfa pasture. We increase the grain feed until they are on full-feed and continue them on pasture for three of four months or even longer. They are then given a short feeding period—6 weeks or longer in dry lot. Alfalfa pasture should carry from three to five yearling steers on full feed per acre. In general, we have secured more rapid gains from cattle fed on alfalfa pasture than in dry lot. The steers fed on alfalfa pasture have eaten less grain and hay for each 100 pounds of gain than the steers fed in dry lot, but have of course eaten alfalfa pasture. As an average of our work feeding steers on alfalfa pasture, each month's pasture for one steer has saved approximately 260 pounds or a little more than i' s ton of alfalfa hay and practically ¦'„ of a bushel of corn. The possible modifications to any of the plans which I have mentioned are numerous. The plans merely indicate one practical way of marketing some of our roughage and pasture—that is, by converting it into quality beef. THE PASTURE—FOItAGE—LIVESTOCK PROGRAM WALTER TOLMAN, Lincoln In the spring of 1938 the Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program gave as its purposes: 1. Produce high quality roughage 2. Restore pastures 3. Return to grass eroded land 4. Increase acreage of soil building crops 5. Maintain proper livestock-forage balance 6. Utilize forage crops profitably </seg>
         <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION 7. Build up feed reserves 8. Encourage livestock on tenant farms The Agronomist put particular stress on the production of sor - ghums since they have been found to be more certain crops under adverse conditions than corn both for forage and 'grain production. They likewise stressed the use of temporary pastures because of the high production and because they would make possible the resting of the permanent pastures, the best known means of restoration. From a livestock point of view production of sufficient feed was stressed. Most farmers planed for enough feed, for their livestock: under the nost unfavorable conditions with the intention of carrying over the surplus which might be produced in a normal or good year as a reserve to be used as a basis.for increased livestock production and an insurance against forced liquidation of livestock in future unfavorable years. * We have the experience o£ states to the south of us in feeding sorghums which convinced us that they were comparable to corn. The value of the-sorghums as feed was demonstrated not only by feeding tests at the Experiment Station here in Lincoln and No. Platte but also by three cooperative tests conducted in southcentral Nebraska. In these tests at Gibbon, Franklin and Curtis, hogs, sheep and cattle were fed the grain sorghums in comparison to corn. Three thousand five hundred and four farmers most of whom were unable to see the test pigs at either Lincoln or North Platte were able to see these sorghum-fed animals at the test finish-up meetings in con - nection with these tests or at a series of four other feeder meetings at which typical animals from these tests were exhibited. '¦;'.. Not only do farmers and feeders need to know the feed value of the sorghums and the most advantageous way of utilizing them but landlords need to be assured of a cash market for these crops. With experimental results as a basis, commercial feeders will be willing to purchase these sorghums often* at a price above the market If It were necessary to ship them to a central market. This year with grain sorghums worth in the neighborhood of 40&lt;f per hundred on the basis of the Kansas City market they are selling from 50 to 75 a hundred over most of the state as livestock feed with very little being offered for sale. • . - ¦ . ; • The program of forage production was entirely successful. 1938 was a favorable year for forage growth and the A.C.P. Program contributed to a large acreage of forage seedings. On virtually every farm in Nebraska a supply of hay and fodder in excess of the year's need is now in existence.: One of the problems we face is the neces - sity of storing this feed so that it may be available in palatable form </seg>
         <seg id="p530">IWrollT OF .VKBC.ASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRipiTLTCRE with a minimum of waste next year or at some other time when it is needed. The trench silo is without doubt the best storage place for fodder particularly the sorghum fodder since the ensiling process softens the grain and improves the feed value for cattle almost 50? above the feed value for fodder. Nevertheless the cost in labor in - volved in ensiling fodder even though it is not great will probably cause most of the excess fodder to not be stored in fodder form. Stacked fodder may be kept quite satisfactorily. Naturally the drier the fodder becomes the less attractive it is to livestock how - ever, there is surprisingly little damage from weather to sorghum fodder well stacked. It is important that the fodder be relatively dry to prevent molding and spoilage. The problem of the Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program in 1939 will probably center around the utilization of roughage Already some increase in livestock numbers in Nebraska is taking place Particularly the numbers of foundation breeding stock are increas - ing. 4-H breeding livestock club enrollment last year was 50% greater than 1937. Every indication is for a tremendous increase, in 4-H livestock projects in 1939. There is evidence of a keen demand for swine breeding stock. It is quite possible that towards spring a scarcity of brood sows may develop. It would seem the part of wisdom for those intending to increase their hog herds by the pur - chase of gilts to locate sows in their own community now. A nearby herd may be much more carefully studied to be sure of its freedom frdm disease and its record as a profitable, productive herd. Within the next sixty days undoubtedly thousands of high quality grade gilts which may be needed in Nebraska as brood sows will go to the market. The current market price of gilts is probably near the low price of the year. The grain sorghum feeding tests will be conducted again this year as a part of the Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program. In addition a sheep feeding test in which the feeding of ground sorghum fodder in comparison to corn and alfalfa is being conducted. Also a cattle feeding test in which silage will form the basis of the ration for steers to be summer-fed is being conducted. \ THREE YEARS WITH SHEEP RALPH RAIKES, Ashland, Nebraska n,,m£ UrinfV he PaSt three yeaFS We haVe handled a considerable number of hogs, cattle, and sheep and from the experience of finan - cial returns for the investment we can safely place sheep at the top </seg>
         <seg id="p531">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION of the list. For the meager investment of from three to five dollars per head for a good western ewe, we have derived enough wool to pay the keep and averaged about one and a quarter lambs per ewe raised and sold for the past three years. The average value of the lamb crop has always been considerably more valuable than the ewes and the ewes have either been resold on the market at a nominal depreciation or kept over for another lamb crop. There is certainly no other animal that can make such returns from such an investment. Taking notice of our farm records, our first experience with sheep began in the fall of 1935 when we purchased 34 one-year breeder ewes and one good ram for a total of J135.00. These ewes were kept over the winter and bred for spring- lambs that came in April. We sold only 26 lambs from these 34 ewes and these were sold locally as feeders weighing about 45 pounds but our accounts show that they returned $177,00 in wool and lambs for the original 1135.00 investment and we still had the ewes left. This good return was the incentive for our Increasing our flock of ewes and was also the beginning of a lot of difficulties and sad experiences. It seems that during the past three years we have ex - perienced almost everything that could happen to ewes. The only thing that we had not had was trouble with sheep-killing dogs and about two weeks ago dogs got Into our flock, killing one ewe and crippling another. ; The first mistake we made was when we added additional ewes to our flock without culling out the old one-year breeders that had made such a; good record the first year. Some of them had no teeth and some bad udders. We added 150 more ewes and one more buck to the flock j and at the beginning of 1936 had a total of 179 ewes. These ewes were bred for lambing 1 beginning February 15. The first difficulty wehad was that we had gotten scabby ewes. We could not determine the difficulty at first but from the way the -wool began to come off lof the ewes and the great discomfort they showed we called in a veterinarian who thought it was scab and we dipped the ewes. Some! of the old ones died from this and the flock seemed to improve. However in about two more months the same symptoms were noted and this time we reported our case to the State and were quarantined : and had our ewes dipped with the supervision of a state veterinarian. This second dipping occurred in the middle ol February in extremely cold weather. We made the error of not shear - ing the ewes] before they were dipped and we not only almost ruined the wool but we lost over 36 ewes. Some of the ewes had already lambed and ones that were near lambing in some cases were injured and either lost their lambs or died. To add to our troubles our ewes had been kept on a rather small enclosure and due to </seg>
         <seg id="p532">liKl't'UT uF Xh'BJJASKA STATE BOAIiP OF AQRICL'LTL'RE lack of exercise developed pregnancy disease. They would simply go down and be unable to regain their feet and would live for a few days and invariably die.' All of this would have been avoided if they had been allowed to take considerable exercise. With all of this trouble we had a 100 per cent lamb crop from the remaining ewes. Since the lambs came in the middle of the winter it was necessary for someone to care for them during the night and this took one person's time for a period of two weeks. The lambs and their mothers were put on pasture as soon as it was avail - able and the lambs were creep-fed and when weighing about 60 pounds were weaned and full-fed on barley and pasture. We were fortunate in realizing a good price for them and in spite of all the death losses, veterinary fees and feed expenses we had a profit of over $460.00. We went into the year of 1937 with but 50 ewes selected from the large flock of the year before. We had had enough experience with bad udders, ewes that did not claim their lambs because of being thin, that we chose but the best for our third year. We fed a ration of Atlas silage, some cottonseed .meal, and salt and added some corn to the ration shortly before lambing. We had a 150 per cent lamb crop or 75 lambs from the 50 ewes and since they were lambed in April they were allowed to go on the pastures with their mothers as soon as they were able and made a fine start. They were also creep-fed a ration of cracked corn and bran. Our only serious error this year was in weaning the lambs. We believe that from now on we will full-feed the lambs and let them run with their mothers until they are sold as we had always found out iambs to lose some weight when weaned and take a longer time to get to market. In the future we plan to keep about 150 ewes as we have on hand at this time. Since a great deal of shelter and care is required for early lambs as well as additional feed, we intend to lamb in April and make use of available pastures which are mostly temporary as old pastures are not grazed with lambs because of danger of worms. Our ewes are westerns, good for about two years and we are breeding them to purebred Shropshire bucks. We have chosen this procedure because with our equipment, pastures and time it seems to fill our needs best. Each farmer has different conditions. Some lamb only in January and February for early markets and find the practice quite profitable. In spite of all the past difficulties encountered in our operations with sheep, we still believe them to be one of our best investments.

I ' •.'" • " :I.' .• ."¦ ¦ '¦ '¦ - ' EARLY liAMB PRODUCTION M. L. BAKER, North Platte, Nebraska j Interest in farm flocks in Nebraska has increased to a market ex - tent within the past year or two. The farm flock, properly handled, can be' a source of satisfaction and considerable income as well. I know of one western Nebraska woman who keeps a small flock of sheep as her own enterprise, saying that the sheep make her more money and require less work and worry than a Hock of chickens. I Improperly handled, a flock of sheep is a sure source of an - noyance and disappointment. The farm flock may be used to produce early lambs or just lambs. Early lambs, for practical purposes, include those lambs dropped up to about March 1, and marketed by early in June. It is about early lambs that I wish to talk. The production of early lambs has a good many advantages when compared with the production of other lambs. ¦j Early lambs as a rule, enjoy a distinct market advantage over other lambs. They go to market after the heavy runs of fed "west - erns" are over and before the heavy runs of new crop range lambs begin. They go to market at a season when there is a demand for high quality lamb and for these reasons usually command a substantial premium. : . ; Aside from this market advantage, there are other good reasons for producing early lambs. Early lambs escape the hot weather of July and August and escape trouble from stomach worms. The ewe has no lamb tugging at her during the season of hot weather andj short dry pastures, and comes into the breeding season in good condition. She is therefore more likely to produce a good crop of lambs and a good crop of wool the following year. Going into the winter in good condition, the ewe is more easily wintered, and the risk on her is less. There may be some disadvantage to producing early lambs. The necessity for better equipment and more labor are two reason frequent - ly urged against the production of early lambs. A reasonably warm lambing shed is a big advantage, but a little care and ingenuity can do a lot toward bringing the lamb through the first critical hours of life </seg>
         <seg id="p534">UKI'OUT OF XKBUASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURK After he has had a chance to get his bearings, he needs, little more than protection from cold winds and from exposure to cold (rains and wet snow. Expensive and elaborate sheds are not necessary in the pro - duction of early lambs. Early lambs probably do require a little more care at birth than later lambs, but January and February are two months in which we usually have time to give them, and if we wait until there is no - danger of lambs chilling at birth, we have to arrange for their arrival pretty late in the season indeed. In the production of early lambs, two types of ewes are extens - ively used. One of these is the western ewe and the other is the native ewe. Ewes of either kind may be satisfactory. Frequently western ewes which have been discarded from range flocks are used. These are sometimes referred to as "one-year ewes" because they are depended on for only one crop of lambs and are then sent to market along with or ahead of their lambs. Men who understand the handling of such ewes have sometimes found them a profitable proposition, but there are certain, disadvan - tages to their use. If they are to produce a crop of profitable lambs, and if they are to be sold to advantage, liberal winter feeding is necessary. Risk on them is relatively large, and the whole enterprise is more or less speculative. It is probable that the production of early lambs is on a sounder basis when the flock is maintained from year to year and an effort made to maintain or improve its quality by the retention of the best ewe lambs. Some objections will be made to this practice because the ewe lamb can frequently be sold for more than the cost of an old ewe. Permanence and quality are assets not to be despised, and like other agricultural enterprises, the farm flock should be considered from a long time point of view and not merely as today's viewpoint. Such ewe lambs can pay their way too. They will produce a good weight of fleece and although it is contrary to usually recommended practice, they can produce lambs. We breed our January and February ewe lambs to produe late lambs the following year, the lambs coming about the first of May. For the production of these lambs, we believe it is good practice to use either Southdown or Shropshire rams. Then, of course, the ewes should have good feed and care not only before lambing, but especially during the period in which the lambs are suckling the ewe. Handled in this way, we have never been able to see that the ewe suffered any handicap, and the proceeds from the sale of the lambs is a welcome item on the right side of the budget. If early lambs are to be marketed to advantage, they must have good mutton type, quality and finish. </seg>
         <seg id="p535">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' The type quality and the ability to acquire fini&amp;h must come from heredity. A.thick-bodied, thick-fleshed, smooth, vigorous ram of one of the medium wool breeds is an essential to the successful pro - duction of early lambs. '. I Given jtype, quality, and the ability to acquire finish, the care and feeding of the ewe and lamb determines whether the lamb goes to market fat. -.. ¦ i ' ' I '¦.' ¦¦..¦ i ¦¦¦-.¦¦¦¦¦ *¦' ¦ |. As already suggested, our ewes come into the fall In good flesh. They are then pastured on stalk fields, rye pasture and whatever we have. For winter roughage, they are given whatever we have avail - able. If alfalfa is available, we like to feed at least some alfalfa hay. If it is high in price or scarce, we use other roughages includ - ing silage. If roughages are coarse and unpalatable, their palata - bility may be increased and waste decreased by cutting or grinding them, and by sprinkling them with diluted molasses. If we have to depend on carbonaceous roughages, we feed 1 pound of one of the oil meals or cakes per day for each seven to ten ewes. We also feed 1 (pound of steamed bone meal to about every SO ewes. If the ewes are in good condition we do not add grain until close to lambing time. We then feed grain until the ewes go on rye or other good pasture In the spring. . . When the ewes go to pasture in the spring the lambs are kept in dry lot. &#132; : ; : . . : When lambs are a week or two old, they will begin to.eat grain and we usually feed them grain from that time or a little later until they are marketed. We like to give them good quality alfalfa hay also. During this time each lamb will eat about 1% bushels of corn or) other grain, and about 10 pounds of soybean or linseed cake or meal. We usually feed about 8 to 10 pounds of bran per lamb. Lambs fed and handled in this way should weigh from 75 to 90 pomds at market time. .. ¦ We have been able to get some November and December lambs wllch gives one a fine lamb to market the next spring, but we have never been able to get a uniform crop of lambs of this age because many of the ewes fail to breed. Because it simplifies handling, we are now content with January and February lambs. For the past 8 years our lamb crop has run from li/ 3 to 1% lambs per ewe. I A wool clip of from 7 to 15 pounds per ewe should be secured with most of them shearing closer to the 7 than to the 15 pounds. Breed, individuality of the ewe, and feed affect the weight of fleece. The maintenance of a good flock of ewes and the production of early lambs offer distinct opportunities on many farms in Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p536">IlKl'oßT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOW TO START WITH SHEEP M. A. ALEXANDER, Lincoln, Nebraska Nebraska does have a part in sheep production. At least we were quite successful in our show winnings, Nebraska having grand champion fat pen of three wether lambs at the American Royal Live - stock Show. This honor makes us feel very proud and we are going to keep right on trying to feed grand champion sheep. At the present time we have a breeding Jlock of 35 Southdowns, 40 Hampshires, 30 to 35 Shropshires, 22 Rambouillets, and are build - ing a Corriedale flock. It seems as if the Corriedale may be the base for our coming farm flocks. They produce a lot of wool and come the closest to producing 3/ s blood wool of any other breed. This wool works into fabric very nicely and will probably be used mare from year to year. King Brothers of Wyoming, who have one of the largest flocks of sheep, a few years ago used to have about 80 per cent of their flock made up of Rambouillets. Now about 80 per cent of their flock is composed of Corriedale and 20 per cent Rambouillet. The best sheep we produce are those we feed and care for the best. Sheep respond the quickest to good feed and care of all animals although they probably receive the least of all. Wool differs in quality and grade, therefore the wool producer should know the different grades so the buyer doesn't fool him. Feed and care may influence the quality and amount of wool. In fact the wool crop can easily be reduced 25 per cent by lack of feed and care. There is a difference of 3 to 5 cents per pound between combing and clothing wool. In general, wool over 2 inches in length is suitable for combing and commands the higher price. Such wool goes into the best cloth. A careless shearer may leave so much wool on the sheep or he may make so many second cuts that a fleece of combing length might be reduced to a clothing length and thus a reduced price per pound. In starting out to establish a farm flock it is safest to buy yearling western whiteface ewes. If you are experienced in sheep then probably the cheapest way of starting out is to pick up some one-year ewes, that is those ewes that have one more year of useful service. However, with one-year ewes there is more danger of disease. By buying yearling ewes you have more years to pay for them and this is an important point to keep in mind. Western ewes off the range are usually free from disease and are very thrifty. Another method of getting into the sheep business is to watch the feeder market from now until March. There are usually some half-fat ewe lambs that will probably be in, due to lack of feed and </seg>
         <seg id="p537">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION money. These lambs can be wintered on silage and cottonseed cake Along in April sometime they will shear a good fleece and will be growing and developing all the time. The death loss will be very low, they are free from disease, and you will have a very low upkeep. Yearling ewes can also be bred the latter part of July, thus giving you early lambs. It is difficult to buy ewes for breeding otherwise at this time of year. In the summer or early fall of the year If you should want out of the sheep business the best market is for this Kind of ewe. The average price of native lambs at Omaha from 1917 to 1936 in June was over $14. Farmers should try to market their lambs at least by the middle of May. Lambing is always a problem in the winter but we usually try to lamb along in December and January The worst lambing weather here is usually in February. Ewes should receive plenty of exercise at all times and especially around lambing time. Lambing paralysis may be present due to too much roughage, a lack of minerals, or a lack of quick available supply of carbohydrates. Corn is a good feed to supply carbohydrates. Dogs can also be a menace to sheep at lambing time and in other ways, About the best way to handle stray dogs is to use the shotgun. The ram is a very important part of the farm flock. It has been proven time and again that the cheapest ram really costs the most. A good ram will solve many problems and should be carefully picked on conformation and quality. Whether you have grade or purebred ewes it is best to buy a good purebred ram and endeavor to better your flock. WHY SHEEP ARE COMING INTO SEWARD COUNTY K. C. FOUTS, Seward, Nebraska Farm flocks are beginning to come into our county. It is a great deal different from ten years ago when we had 200 farms with farm flocks. Sheep are again being re-established in Seward county with the help of 4-H boys in their various projects. Shortage of crops caused inability to feed cattle or hogs in a 4-H project, so sheep took their place. Sheep take less feed for the 4-H boy or girl and have furnished a new source of farm income. In our 4-H work we need a blocky, thick, type lamb in order to place high in fat lamb competition. We want some Southdown breed - ing back of the lamb so as to give him this type desired in a fat show lamb. </seg>
         <seg id="p538">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE When we started out we didn't exactly know where to look for these lambs. However Mr. Baker at North Platte had some lambs that were a cross of western ewes and a Southdown Tarn. They seemed to be just about what we wanted and so we procured a few of these western crossbred wethers for 4-H boys. These lambs proved to be very healthy and vigorous, and also good feeders. The boys had very good luck with their projects and so next year we did the same thing and repeated the projects again the next year. In three to four years we had the grand champion fat lamb at the Ak-Sar-Ben. Competition for these lambs stimulated their production in Seward county and so we bought 14 ewes from Mr. Baker and various other places. One thing we were very careful and particular about was to purchase good rams and as a result we have met with good results. The Aegerter and Carr boys won carload lot at the Ak-Sar-Ben this year and at our county fair we had as high as 42 lambs in one market class. We have found that a good Southdown ram on thrifty western ewes is what is desired for 4-H club competition. A youngster feeding 4-H lambs learns much about feeding and marketing. He becomes a very keen observer and it develops his business ability. There is no special breed of sheep in Seward county so we say we have a breed of choice. I believe westerns are coming in and are becoming more popular. We have our problems to contend with such as dogs and disease. A strong pen should be built for the sheep to stay In at night, thus preventing loss from dogs or wild animals. Stomach worms also bother sheep and so drenching is necessary to guard against this disease. In brief, 4-H work has been very beneficial in .helping- the Seward county sheep business. We hope that with an increase in crop pro - duction we will have an increase in farm flocks. LIVESTOCK LOSS PREVENTION DEMONSTRATION Hamilton County 4-H Club Introduction of team by Mr. L. I.

         <seg id="p539">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION demonstration teams from Hamilton county, who will give you a demonstration on livestock loss prevention. This team was first in the Omaha area, thus winning a trip to the National Congress at Chicago. We are members of the Piggly Wiggly Club and our names are Eugene and Myron Gustafson. We are going to attempt to show you now to prevent losses in marketing livestock. ~ Quality and finish are factors affecting the price received for Hvestock. First let us look at the annual loss resulting from bruising This loss amounts to 3 million head dead and crippled and 9 million bruised. As usual the loss is on them more valuable cuts such as the |loin and ham. In 20 per cent of the cattle bruised we find 18 per cent is on loin and 2 per cent on other cuts. In 20 per cent of the hogs bruised we find 3 per cent on the back, 1 per cent on ham 4 per cent on bellies, and 3 per cent on shoulders. Kicking trampling Crowding and rough handling are causes of bruising. Equipment jmch as clubs, hammers, neck yokes, blacksnakes, broken boards Jitchforks, endgate rods, or any any hard object should not be used nstead use an old broom or a canvass slapper. This slapper makes lots of noise and costs only 35 to 50 cents. It can very easily be' made at .home from an old strip of canvass and a pitchfork handle The electric prod is very useful in loading stock and the cost Is quite sniAii* ' ' ... . ¦¦ , The loading shoot should be smooth inside as also the truck box. There should be partitions for mixed loads and bedding on the fk&gt;or. Sand makes the most desirable bedding and can be covered with straw in winter. A canvass cover over the top of the truck box is very good for windbreak in the winter and to keep the heat out in the summer. Hurdles and gates are also quite useful in loading or coralling stock. Some animals that have not been properly fed have weak bones 4 good mineral mixture to make strong bones la 1 part common salt 2 parts ground limestone, and 2 parts steamed bone meal. -¦ We hope that we have shown you a few things about Uvestock loss prevention and we have enjoyed giving you this demonstration We thank you. </seg>

I\ GAKEV, Lincoln, Nebraska Professor of Rural Economics In analizing the hog prospects for 1939 three conditions need to be considered. 1. Production prospects. The number of pigs farrowed this fall is estimated to be IS per cent more than the number farrowed last fall. This increase is somewhat larger than was indicated by breeding intentions reported in June. Conditions developed which caused a number of farmers to increase breeding late in the summer as indicated by the large number of fall litters coming as late as November and early December. This doubtless was the reflection of a highly favorable corn-hog situation and the large supplies of other feed grains. The last spring pig crop was 13 per cent larger than the year previous and when com - bined with the fall farrowings make a total increase of pigs in 193S of 15 per cent over that in 1937. The total number of Pigs raised this year is estimated at 71,000.000 head, an increase of 9.000.000 over that of last year. This is the largest yearly crop since 1.033 but is still about 12 per cent smaller than the five year average for the period 1929 to 1933. The combined spring and fall pig crops in the corn belt this year is estimated at 48.000.000 head and is about 16 per cent larger than a year ago but considerably smaller than for the five year period above mentioned. The indicated number of sows to farrow in the spring of 1939 is 8.238.000 or 21 per cent more than the number that farrowed in the spring of 1938. An increase in spring farrowings of 21 per cent would be one of the largest percentage increases in recent years. Because of the feed situation hogs will probably be fed to heavier weights during this winter and spring feeding period than they were last year which will add to the amount of porK marketed the coming spring. 2. The Feed situation. The production of feed grains, not in - cluding wheat, in the United States in 1938 was about 200,000,000 bushels below that of 1937. The production in Nebraska in - creased about 4 7.000,000 bushels over that of a year ago. The number of hogs on farms increased about 1,500,000 head in the United States and remained about the same in Nebraska. . The number of cattle declined slightly in 1938 from that in 1937 for both the United States and Nebraska so the number of bushels </seg>
         <seg id="p541">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION of feed available for hogs, alhough not quite as favorable for the United States as a year ago, is more favorable for Nebraska. ¦ The hog-corn ratio is fairly safe indication of the feed situa - ion with respect to feeding hogs. The ratio for the year ending ?* £r, ber&gt; 1938 ' iS Indlcated at 14-8 'or- the United States and 15.9 for Nebraska. This ratio is much more favorable than it was a year ago and as long as this situation continues the con - ditions for hog production will be favorable. In view of the fact that farmers who are equipped to produce hogs have their equip - ment on hand which would be idle if hogs were not fed they can probably afford.to feed hogs when this ratio is as low a's 9. •¦:?. Demand situation. The consumption of pork has a direct relation to the amount of employment. The indications for the coming year point to greater numbers in employment than was true in 1937 A great deal of the employment increase will be In the durable goods industry and such employment will increase its consumption in the meat products produced in this country. The foreign trade outlook has been improved during the last \ oW yf arS&gt; °"r eXPOrtS In POrk for the year endln&amp; to September, 1938, increased 50 per cent over those of a year ago and our exports of .lard increased 94 per cent. During this same period our imports of porfc products decreased 21 per cent. Lard Is much more important than pork in our exports and previous to the depression, 1930, we exported in the neighborhood of one - third of the lard produced in the United States.

         <seg id="p542">RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The recent trade agreements with Canada and Great Britain should improve both the domestic and foreign outlook for pork pro - ducts. The domestic outlook will be improved because of increased employment in industry and the foreign outlook because of conces - sions made by Canada and Great Britain in these treaties. In general, the conditions appear favorable for the hog raiser in 1939 and if the foreign and domestic situations continue as in - dicated at the present there should be no serious decline in hog prices. For the producer who has no hog disease and who knows the hog production business, 1939 will undoubtedly be good to him. The producer who has disease or who has had it recently on his farm or who knows little about the hog production business should expend this phase of his farm business rather curiously and do so only after giving thorough thought to the situation. BOYS SHOW THE WAY GLENN HEADY, Randolph, Nebraska The Randolph boys of the Vocational Agriculture Department are carrying as livestock projects this year 72 head of purebred pedigreed sow and litter projects, 13 baby beeves, 5 head of dairy heifers and 1150 baby chicks from trapnested flocks of hens. It was due to the unbalance of livestock and feed prices and the low prices of slaughter stock during the past number of years that caused a production of greatly crossed up, poor quality stock on the farms of Nebraska. Lack of feed due to droughty years had also discouraged the farmers to try to keep up production of better quality livestock. This condition prevailed in the Randolph vicinity as well as other parts of the state. Beginning with a study of these conditions in the fall of 1935 the boys of this vocational agriculture department set out to improve the quality of stock by first introducing a number of purebred hogs as vocational agriculture projects. By this method they -were also going to have a good start in livestock production themselves. Their motive was to sell their surplus gilts and boars out for breeding stock to the farmers and other vocational agriculture boys who were to come into the department in later years. From the herds of J. D. Holiday of Orchard, Nebraska and Joseph Arens of Hartington, they cooperatively purchased 10 head of pedigreed sows of the Duroc and Black Poland breeding. The drought of 1936 was the cause of the failing of all but 3 of these prospective herds. The 3 which survived served as the basis of fine foundation herds on 3 farms in the community. </seg>

The largest acreage of crops grown by any one boy during the present year will be 30 acres. FINANCING FOUNDATION BREEDING STOCK E. E. PLACEK, Wahoo, Nebraska Bankers were faced with a serious problem in 1933 when federal corn loans were first made available. Many farmers not in the pros-ram wanted to make loans on their corn through the banks. I did not know what to do so went to the Omaha banks for advise." They very unanimously advised me against these loans but I went ahead and started out to handle $100,000 worth of corn loans. My deposits and money available for loans increased so fast that I wound up loaning $580,(100—more than any three other banks in the state. I feel that Nebraska's livestock industry can be rebuilt through cooperation of credit agencies, the farmers themselves, the agricul - tural college, and all other groups interested in Nebraska agriculture. Whenever I receive any information from the college and other sources that I feel is important, I mimeograph it and send it out with a personal letter to my fa&gt;rm customers. I do this so they will have the most reliable information available on progressive farming methods. In my estimation there are three necessary factors for .making money in hogs. They are proper breeding, proper sanitation and housing, and proper feeding. I like to make loans on livestock be - cause we want our people to have more milk cows, hogs, and more money. We want more livestock in Saunders county because men with only corn and wheat are making no money. It seems as if Professor Gramlich's statement that "there are more dogs than hogs in the country" is about true. The bank is the heart of the community through which all its lifeblood must pass. If a bank is going to crawl into its shell and simply take deposits without making loans, it has lost all reason to exist. Naturally a banker cannot possibly make loans to every farmer without regard to his integrity or farming ability but loans soundly </seg>
         <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS 'ASSOCIATION made usually bring returns. It seems as if people do not realize or care to take the advice of college graduates or professors but if the banker insists, farmers who patronize him will adopt sound farming methods. . &gt; . . I I am no philanthropist but do have a selfish interest in sound i fanning because my bank owns several farms. Sorghums are a wonderful crop and have solved the feed problem making the feeding of hogs and cattle possible. By cooperation with 4-H clubs and other groups we are trying to restore livestock in our county. One day I was showing a farmer some contour pasture terracing. His reply was "It looks all Tight I guess but how can 1 drive my car after the cows over all those bumps?" !• ¦¦ ' - '¦'¦'' '' '" ¦ ¦¦¦''¦ ' ' ¦•' ¦'¦ '"'¦¦"¦ '•¦"•¦ [ I think the banker should take care of his community through loans wherever possible, thus giving the farmer more incentive to go forward. We don't .have any rugged individualists now but we are governed by laws and regulations supposed to benefit society. If the banker helps, then the community «an go forward and progress more rapidly. The farmers, miners and various other industries produce the national wealth of the world. We produce the raw naterial which takes work, sweat, and labor. It is something that we can't reach -up in a tree for or pull out of our hat but takes time and work. We want to show our people how to do this work more efficiently so as to give them a higher standard of living and to make better citizens of their children. HOW CAN BUSINESS HELP? F. L. LOVE, Chicago, Illinois I want tp express appreciation for the opportunity you have given me to attend this meeting.

Our interest in this question is justifiable when you con - sider how closely linked your business and ours is and that we are bbth a part of the great livestock industry. Your problems and ex- </seg>
         <seg id="p546">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE periences are of vital interest to us and have an immediate effect upon our operations and, likewise, our problems have an effect upon your operations. If the livestock producer is prosperous and enjoys good returns for the livestock which he raises he is able to stay in business and market a goodly number of livestock each year which adds great stability to the business of the processor. Likewise, if the producer is able to bring to market a quality and type of live - stock that meets the consumer preference and taste, it provides a product that is easier and more economical for us to merchandise, and this is reflected back to the producer by way of higher net returns to him. If we can more nearly meet consumer requirements we will stimulate meat consumption which, as you can readily under - stand, helps both the producer and the packer. So, it would be dif - ficult to cite any line of business where the interests of the producer and the processor are so mutual and closely connected as in the live - stock and meat business. The livestock industry has experienced many difficulties during the past half dozen years, many of which are still with us and will require more time to overcome. First, we had liquidation and re - duced production of livestock created by the 1934 drought. Then came the extreme market shortage of hogs and reduced supplies fed cattle during the following year. Then, as you gentlemen too well know, wp were again confronted by an equally severe drought in 1936 which has been responsible for many of the problems and de - velopments in our livestock and meat markets during the past year or two. These unfavorable weather conditions have adversely af - fected the industry in a number of ways. The sharp curtailment in the supplies of meat available for consumers and the relatively high price resulting therefrom—created much consumer resistance against our products. It opened the way for competing food industries to take advantage of the temporary situation by promoting their pro - ducts and taking over a share of the food market which previously was occupied by meat and rightfully belongs to the meat industry. As a result, these severe conditions not only have made the business of the producer and the packer extremely hazardous during the pasi few years but have also further contributed to the consumer resis - tance against meat. Here in Nebraska, where the livestock industry represents three quarters of the total farm income, we have seen as great a liquida - tion of livestock as in any other state in the Nation. In the spring of 1938 Nebraska produced 2.128,000 pigs in comparison to 4,798,000 in 1933 —a decrease of So I,*.^. In 1930, '31 and "32 the state of Ne - braska was the second largest producer of hogs in the entire United States. Today, Nebraska ranks seventh among the states in the production of hogs. Likewise, on January Ist of this year there </seg>
         <seg id="p547">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION" were onljr 2, 824,000 cattle and calves on farms in | this state in comparison to 3,610,000 head in 1933-a decrease of \ 22%. it has been demonstrated, time after time, that livestock is essential to prosperity on farms in this area. A few years ago we witnessed a trend on the part of many farmers towards the production of cash grain crops. Today, however, the trend appears to be' in the other direction. It has been stated that the average farm family in this ¦gate requires WO.OO cash a year to live. If such is the case I think that you will agree with me that it is very difficult for the average farmer in. this state to realize, year in and year out, a cash profit of ?700.00 from his grain crops and, hence, it lis only right pat the trend should be back towards increased and improved live - stock production on the farms in this state. | It is undoubtedly for this reason that many of you have gathered here today to discuss a program of livestock rehabilitation. I assume that in assigning me the subject "How Can Business Help," you had in mind, more particularly, how can business help the farmer to rehabilitate his farm with livestock? j Because of the fine] work which the Agricultural colleges have been doing and because of their dose relation with the livestock producers, we, of Wilson &amp; Co., believe that if there is any place for us to serve in assisting livestock producers one of these is through closer cooperation with the colleges. Tor that reason we always appreciate an opportunity to supplement or assist the college in any way in the development of any of their livestock improvement pro- JLCtS. -. : ¦ ""_.;¦¦-..¦¦¦ ..- . ¦; ' . i Durin g| the early part of last fall I had the pleasure of visiting with members of the Dept. of Animal Husbandry, the Extension Ser - vice and others here at Lincoln. In discussing the situation with Professors Gramllch and Loeffel, they mentioned a number of prob - lems that they considered limiting factors in the rehabilitation of hog production in this state. Problems they mentioned included: -&#132;;¦.: Ist. The lack of breeding stock of the right type and quality .-.| 2nd. Inadequate credit ;¦.!¦ 3rd. Lack of appreciation of the Importance of proper methods of breeding and feeding. • « belf CTed that banks, lending agencies and other financial X iTv i lend a8«l8t "ce to the farmer in rehabilitating his farm with^livestock by making available adequate credit, and that Wilson &amp; Co. and similar business institutions had an opportunity to help remove the other limiting factors which I mentioned, we felt that one way this could be done was by making open or bred gilts </seg>
         <seg id="p548">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATK HOARD OF AGRICULTURE available to 4-H Club and Vocational Agricultural boys and also to farmers and by helping the College demonstrate good breeding and feeding methods and desirable market type. We knew that such a program would be made easier as a 'result of the extensive effort which the college authorities have made and are .making on the matter of credit with the State Bankers Association, Government lending agencies and similar institutions. Wilson &amp; Co. was, there - fore, happy to be able to work out, with the College people here at Lincoln, a cooperative plan to improve the market type of hogs, methods of production and to assist in a limited way in .rehabilitation. This program has been set up in the South East corner of this state in the counties of Lancaster, Cass, Otoe, Johnson and Nemaha. The project is a four way one including 4-H Clubs and Smith-Hughes Vocational Agricultural students, local farmers, the Nebraska College of Agriculture and Wilson &amp; Co. Prof. Loeffel of this college is heading up the program and is receiving the able assistance of his associates in the Department of Animal Husbndry and Extension Service here at the college, the county agents, 4-H Club leaders and Smith-Hughes instructors in the counties previously mentioned. The project is, primarily, a demonstration in practical hog raising with emphasis on type, disease control and proper feeding and handling. At Nebraska City, Wilson &amp; Co. operates the Nebraska City Union Stock Yards and, commencing about the middle of October, we began selecting from our market run of hogs at that point such gilts as were of the right type and which qualified for breeding animals. These gilts were placed in sanitary yards, dipped, vaccinated and are now being bred to a desirable type of pure-bred boars of various breeds which our Company purchased. The gilts are being fed and handled in accordance with instructions from the Animal Husbandry experts of this college. They will be offered for sale on or about January 14th to 4-H Club members, Smith-Hughes students and any farmers who are interested. A limit of two gilts will be sold to any one individual. The gilts will be sold for an average of $23.00 with a minimum of $22.00 and a maximum of $24.00 per head. This price is somewhat less than the actual costs incurred in making these gilts available. During the fall of 1939 a pig show will be held at Nebraska City under the direction of the Nebraska College of Agriculture—at which time the progeny from these gilts will compete for ribbons and prizes. The awards will be based upon record of performance and market qualifications. It is to be hoped that we will also' be able to work out a way of encouraging the retention of the gilts from these litters for breeding purposes. Incidentally, I want to say that we would be glad to have you visit the Nebraska City Union Stock Yards and see the gilts and </seg>
         <seg id="p549">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION '¦¦.....¦. s boars which have been selected for this project. If there happens to be any of you here from the counties -which I mentioned who have (not. yet-heard about the project and who are interested in obtaining one or two of these bred gilts I would suggest you communicate with your local county agent or with Professors Loeffel, Derrick or Tolman here at the college. We believe that such a program as this, directed by the Agri - cultural College and supplemented by a business organization, can be of assistance in providing the small or medium sized farmer with a few head of livestock to start him back into the business on a sound basis. ..I want to point out at this time, however, that we of Wilson and Co. share the view expressed by the people here at the College that It is definitely wiser for farmers to grow into rather than go into the livestock business. Too often in periods such as this, we find producers acquiring any kind of breeding stock that is Vheap and readily available and without giving any consideration to its ability to produce, efficiently, progeny that have a profitable market outlet. This is easy to understand when we consider the local scarcity of good breeding stock and the limited credit that is available. This, in our opinion, represents a major problem in sound livestock rehabilitation and business should be able to render assis - tance in meeting it. I would like to digress just for a moment to pay homage to that great crop sorghums. Wilson &amp; Co. has watched the development and progress of sorghums in this state with keen interest. We sin - cerely believe that it is the answer to one of your most vexing problems. Again, this year, we saw two or three days of hot wind dry up the corn crop in this state so that it was almost a total failure whereas the sorghums simply remained dormant during the two or three days of hot wind and then went ahead to produce a most satis - factory crop. We have been particularly interested in the results obtained .here at the college this fall in "hogging down" sorghums. The very fact that an acre of sorghums, when "hogged down", produced 425 pounds of pork worth about thirty to thirty-five dollars is truly promising particularly when you consider that in the very next field the corn crop was probably worth two to three dollars an acre. To my present knowledge cattle and hogs fed sorghums produce satis - factory carcasses. For these reasons, therefore/we in the meat pack - ing industry believe that sorghums have a very definite place in this state and that they will prove to be the solution to at least one of your problems. But to return to my subject— We believe that business can further assist the livestock producer by making him familiar with the many problems which we encounter In our business and which have a direct bearing on his net return </seg>
         <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE so that he may overcome them in the future. I have reference to the many mutual problems which we have, such as the maintenance of the health and sanitation of our livestock, the elimination of grubby cattle, bruised and crippled livestock, not to mention .many others. One of the finest illustrations of the benefits to be derived from cooperative effort in this industry is the accomplishment made during the last 20 years in tuberculosis eradication in animals. I would like to pause just long enough to pay tribute to the federal &amp; state vetenarians, the extension workers, and many others who con - tributed to the success of this program which incidentally we have definite evidence of our combined achievements through ,the record of condemnation and retentions due to this disease. The reduction of condemnations and retentions in federal inspected establishments dur - ing the last 20 years indicated an annual savings to the industry of around $10,000,000. We have many other mutual problems, as for example, the 112,000,000 annual loss from bruised and crippled live - stock. Such a loss is largely the result of carelessness and lack of understanding on the part of our livestock producers &amp; handlers. As packers, we realize that our primary responsibility is to do an economical job of processing, develop new outlets and expand existing markets for your products. We have, through many years of thorough-going research developed refinements in processing and manufacturing that have greatly improved the quality, flavor and general appeal of meat products to the consumer. Wilson &amp; Co. is very proud of its accomplishments in developing many of these new products. We feel that they represent just another way in which business is helping and can continue to help the livestock producer. In conclusion, I want to say that I sincerely believe that in meeting the issues that are ahead it is highly Important that we have a full appreciation for one anothers problems, we are both a part of a great industry, and each is indispensable to the other I further believe that we will both enjoy success if we continue our approach to a solution of these problems on broad, constructive lines affecting every phase of production, financing and distribution of the products of our toil. Herein lies, in my opinion, the greatest hope for sustain - ing progress in our livestock industry. Ravenna, Nebraska December 19, 1938 Mr. W. W.

Tor it is not only educational but also very interesting because you see the finest livestock that is in America. When leaving on this trip we boarded the Union Pacific Challen - ger in Kearney at 3:10 p.m., Wednesday, November 23 1 and arrived in Chicago at 8:45 a.m. Thursday, November 24. We took a taxi to the Harrison Hotel, where we were going to stay. We registered at the hotel and after unpacking our grips we rode the elevated train out to the Stock Show and looked at some of the stock which was just coming in. We looked around for about two hours and then went back to the hotel and ate dinner. Then we went up to our room and rested until about five and then went out and walked around until about six.

I was in Group D under the super - vision of Paul Brown, a county agent from Mississippi. The first class. Group D, has to judge was fat lambs, next was Angus heifers, Percheron mares, Poland China fat barrows, Hampshire breeding e^yes, fat steers, Belgian mares, and Hampshire fat barrows. About twelve we finished judging and went to the Stock Yard's Inn, each group staying with Ub leader. After lunch we went upstairs at the Inn and gave reasons. We finished giving reasons about six and then we walked around the Yards until seven. Then we went to a banquet given for the boys that judged In the contest. After the banquet the winners of the contest were announced. The high team in all classes was Texas with a total of 1556 points and Ye were in ninth place with a total of 1496 points.

Next morning we met the rest of the Nebraska delegation which arrived at seven-thirty Sunday morning. After they arrived we went back to the hotel and ate breakfast. Then we went to the 4-H church at the CongTess Hotel, after this we ate dinner and then went to a Magic Key broadcast. Then we went for a 45-mile bus ride of the city which cost us one dollar. In the evening we went to a 4-H program' and then we went to bed. Monday morning we went out to the Stock Yards where we paraded, all states being in one large group. Then we went in to the Stock Show and watched some of the judging. We then went to a luncheon with the compliments of the Thomas E. Wilson and Company. After the luncheon, which by the way was more of a banquet, than a luncheon, we went back to the Stock Show where we paraded in the arena before the crowd. We then went to the hotel by bus and went to bed. On Tuesday we went to Armour and Company where we were given a breakfast. Then we were shown through their packing plant. At noon we were guests of the Producers Association and were given a good knife as a souvenir. The remainder of the afternoon was spent going through a museum. In the evening we went to the annual 4-H National Banquet at the Stevens Hotel. On Wednesday morning we went on a tour through the Inter - national Harvester Company's manufacturing plant where we saw •machinery made and also went through the twine plant where twine is made. Before we went to a luncheon which was given by the Company we had our picture taken in a group. After the lunch we enjoyed a very fine entertainment put on by the most popular radio stars. Wednesday evening we went to the 4-H Dress Revue, party and dance which lasted until midnight. Thursday morning we went to the Museum of Arts and to the Aquarium which was very interesting and educational. At noon we were guests of Sear, Roebuck and Company at the Stevens Hotel. After lunch a very good entertainment was put on. Thursday after - noon we went to the Museum of Arts and Science. Thursday even - ing we went to a show and then boarded the train for Omaha at 10.10 p.m. and arrived there at 10:20 a.m., Friday .morning.

We arrived tn Omaha at 8:30 where we changed trains and started for Chicago about 10:00 o'clock. It was now time for us to retire. We were sorry not to see any of the State of lowa as we traveled through during the night. Early Thursday morning we found ourselves over In Illinois, about one hundred fifty miles from Chicago. About 8:30 the train pulled into the big depot at Chicago. We were taken to the Harrison Hotel, the 4-H club headquarters, where we unpacked and prepared for a week's stay. We spent the rest of the day getting acquainted with our 4-H friends who were coming for the International Judging contest. Friday morning we woke with lots of pep for the greatest contest we could enter. This contest was held in the Chicago Inter - national Livestock arena. We judged cattle, horses, hogs, and sheep. Our team placed ninth and I placed fifth individually in judging cattle. Friday evening the International Livestock Exposition gave a banquet for the judging team and at this time the winning teams and in - dividuals were presented with ribbons and scholarships. </seg>

We also visited the Mundelin monastery which has many beautiful buildings built around a lake. The pine trees were very beautiful around these buildings. The fund for this monastery was started by Mr. Heine in memory of his son who was killed in France during the World War. Frjom there we went to the Bohai Temple .which is being built by the followers of the Bohai Religion. The land on which the House of Warship stands cost $125,000. Structurally, the Temple is remarkable in that it will comprise a steel, reinforced concrete and glass framework, on which will be placed the highly ornamental surface material, lit is a nine - sided structure; each side having the form of a circular arc, with a laTge doorway in the center; and the -whole edifice giving the appearance of extending welcoming arms to the people j approaching from every direction. Pylons forty-five feet in height stand like sentinels at the corners of the first story. Our guide said when this building was finished it would be one of the finest in the world. We finished the day by going to Lake Oeiuiva in Wisconsin and then back to the Harrison Hotel. Monday morning we went to the International Livestock Expo - sition where we viewed some of the worlds best animals including the Grand Champion Angus which sold for nearly $4,000.00. Monday afternoon we went ro the wonderful Medinah Temple. This Temple will seat 4,500 people in its mammoth auditorium and serve 2,500 in its dining room. Here a wonderful program was given for the 4-H club boys and girls. During this program Mary Pickford talked to us a few minutes. In the evening a banquet wns given, through the courtesy of Thomas E. Wilson and Sons. Tuesday morning we were guests of Armour and Company at breakfast after which we were taken on an educational tour through the plant of Armour and Company. At luncheon we were guests of the National Livestock Marketing Association where each boy was presented with a knife. In the afternoon we went to the Art Institute where we saw some of the work of the worlds greatest painters and sculptors. In the evening the annual banquet of the Seventeenth National 4-H Club Congress was held in the grand ballroom of the Stevens Hotel. The National winners were presented and the program "When Old Songs were New" was greatly enjoyed. </seg>

The McCormick Twine Mill can manufacture enough twine in a year to bind 24,000,000 acres of grain. Here we were served a "family style" dinner and were entertained by Fibber McGee and Company. In the evening after the 4-H Style Revue we had a 4-H party at the Trianon. Thursday we visited the Adler Planetarium and Astronomical Museum. We were told there had been 3,830,000 people visit the place since its opening in May 1930. We also visited the Field Museum of Natural History, one of the worlds finest scientific and educational institutions. Here we saw animals, plants and geological features of practically every known area of the earth as well as objects pertaining to the lives of the peoples of the world. Our guide explained how the animals are mounted and many other exhibits are prepared. In the Hall of Prehistoric Life we were given a good idea of the plant and animal life of long ago. After we had seen what the world was like in those early times our guide took us to see how man lived in those early days shown by the eight diagrams and hundreds of tools and weapons exhibited in the Hall of the Stone Age of the Old World. We also visited the Hall of the Roses of Mankind. We were interested in the Aquarium, famous for Its collection of live fish and other aquatic creatures from all over the world. We were guests ot Sears Roebuck and Company for luncheon Thursday and then we visited the Museum of Science and Industry. From here we went to our hotel and began to get ready for home. On my trip I saw people from nearly all the states, Hawaii and Porto Rico. We were given many souvenirs. This has been a wonderful trip for me and makes me more eager to do 4-H work next year.

Young, Jr., Kiniball President of Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative At this time we pause a few moments in memory of and to honor the late Jacob Pedrett, co-founder of the Certified seed potato industry in Nebraska. Jacob Pedrett, pioneer homesteider, ranch - man and farmer, was born in Thusis, Kanton Graubund en, Switzer - land on November 7th, 1856, the only son of Ulrich and Fiede Ped - riitt. His mother died when he was a small child. He had five older sisters. When he was in his early teens his father l&gt;ecame com - ipletely paralyzed and the burden of caring for the famiiy rested on his shoulders. When he was thirty, his father had passed away, his sisters were self-supporting and he was free to realize the dream of a lifetime—to come to America. So with practicaliv no money, a good Swiss education, some knowledge of the Italian language, but not a word of English, he came to the America he had idealized and which he thought the most wonderful country imaginable, although his love for Mb native land was not lessened thereby. One of his daughter's writes of him: "I never have known of anyone whose love of country was so deep, so wonderful as was my Dad s. His love for America and for Switzerland, sort of awed me. It has always been a great pride to me that he and mother taught tli emselves to i read and speak English at a time when adult education was not avail - -1 able, and that they made Americans out of their children, not little ¦| foreigners.. Mother and Dad studied the readers and other books </seg>

It Is an interesting thing in our family that my oldest brother could not speak one word of English when he entered school at the age of 4%, and that my youngest brother could not speak a word of German. To think of Dad coming to America at the age of thirty with nothing but a won - derful sense of humor and an almost unbelievable faith in human nature, being able to make for himself and for his family such a Place in society, and that he was able to do such valuable work for his community and for state as he did. makes me, who has had every opportunity for advancement, feel very humble indeed." When "Jake" landed in America he came directly cross-country to Hastings, Nebraska where he found work as a cheese maker, and later rented a dairy and went into the business of making cheese He operated this business with 36 cows on a share basis until 1890 when he was attracted to Kimball County by the wonderful reports about a country where cattle could live all winter on the prairie grass without any additional feed or protection. He was very much disappointed, however, upon his arrival in Kimball County to see the prairie so brown and dry, as he had visualized them bright and green as they were in the valleys of his native Switzerland. How - ever, the fat stock ranging the prairie convinced him of the possibili - ties for a location of a dairy herd. So he rented a 160 acre farm near Kimball, which had a small stone house on it, where he immed - ately moved his family and his worldly possessions, consisting of 10 cows, a team of horses, a spring wagon and some farm machinery Lpon his arriving here he continued in the cheese making for a num - ber of years. At a Chicago exposition he was awarded a blue ribbon on his product. During the dry and trying years of the 90's, he supplemented his meager revenue by going to Greeley, Colorado, to pick potatoes as did many other homesteaders of this locality. He homesteaded in the same district on which he served as a school director for 42 years, and assisted in building three different school houses in that district. The last one, a two-teacher school, now generally known as the Pedrett School. He was one of the first men to found a herd of registered Hereford cattle in Kimball County, operating this enter - prise under the name of Pedrett and Clark for a term of 5 years During these early days cattle rustling was a common practice About this time Paul Rose, a rancher, was murdered and buried on the prairie near the Colorado-Nebraska line. His cattle were stolen and driven away. When the body was found, it was "Jake" Pedrett and the spring wagon, which he brought from Hastings, that brought the body to town. He was one of Kimball County's first winter wheat farmers, sowing a ten acre patch in 1901 on land that he had </seg>

When the Kimball Irrigation District was formed July 22, 1909, he was one of the original petitioners and later became a board member.¦"-. As early as 1906, "Jake' 1 and Professor Burr and Dean Burnett attempted to organize a Farmer's Institute in Kimball, but did not receive any attendance at their meeting. Continuing their faith in the possibilities of such an organization they postponed the meet - ing for another year. This meeting was well attended, and an In - stitute organized of which "Jake" was the first President. As a result of this organization, and contacts made through it with the University of Nebraska, a few years later, in 1916 a meeting was called by Professor Howard, of the Horticulture Department of the University of Nebraska, in company with E. Meade Wilcox of the Plant pathology Department of the University, and R. E. Holland, County Agentlof kimball County, Mr. North, Agricultural Agent of Sheridan County, County Agent Sidel of Box Butte County, Wayne Wilson of Alliance, and Link Davis of Gordon, with "Jake" Pedrett of Kimball, in, the Alliance Hotel, at which place an [organization was formed that would serve the potato industry of Western Ne - braska. The Nebraska Potato Improvement Association developed out of this. Link Davis was elected President, and "Jake" Pedrett, j Vice-president, j It was on the way to attend the meeting of this Aa- J soeiation at Bulhville In 1919, that "Jake" rode the TM-Weekly freight train, which he dubed "the Tri-Weakling", because it got stuck in a snow bank near Chadron and he got out and walked in to town and caught a passenger train while some of the others remained in the caboose. He always claimed the reason he was elected vice-president then was becausjs he got there ahead of all the others. Dr. H. O. Werner Professor of Horticulture at the University of Nebraska, stated that "Jake" provided facilities as long as 23 years ago for the grow - ing of experimental stock in experiments conducted by some of the departments of the State Experiment Station. ; .He was unioubtedlyione of the pioneer potato growers of Kim - ball county. In the early days he was very alert in trying to get information on I all modern methods. Long before anyone else seemed to be paying attention to it, 'Jake 1 was insisting that his men handle the potatoes carefully, and did not permit them to climb up on top of the sacks when loading cars. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Nebraska Potato Improvements Association when the seed certification work was turned over to that organization by the Agricultural College. That organization decided that the organiza - tion certifying potatoes should also sell the potatoes, and out of it grew the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Co-operative." "Jake" </seg>
         <seg id="p562">KKPOHT OF XKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICL'LTL'RE was a Director of this organization, which has been certifying potatoes since 1924 and was a Director continuously until 1930. In July 1918 he made a trip to the Greeley potato district and the Colorado Experiment Station at Fort Collins to study potato diseases. In this party was a group of County Agents consisting of A. W. Tell of Scottsbluff, C. A. Sawyer of Sheridan, W. A. McComb of Morrill, H. E. Gould of Cheyenne, J. W. Logan of Duel, George Kellog of Keith and Bert Barker of North Platte. He was sent to the State Legislature from the 95th District for the years 1927 and 1925, and made a useful contribution to general agriculture by sponsoring a bill in the State Legislature providing for the establishment of an experimental farm to be devoted principally to potatoes. He went against his own political interests by having this farm located in Dox Butte County, because it was generally recog - nized that this county was more centrally located in regard to a large acreage of the dry-land potato in Western Nebrsaka than was any other county. This, no doubt, proved to be the logical location, as is supported by a statement of Dr. H. O. Werner in which he says: "I know that having had this experimental farm during the last nine years has enabled the accomplishment of two very definite things. One was the determination of the great improvement in yield by stor - ing moisture in the soil for the growing of potatoes on dry land. Fortunately, the findings concerning this practice were accepted promptly and have been of value to the most alert potato growers during the recent drouth period. The other accomplishment of this farm has been the development of large quantities of seed stock that are practically free of virus diseases." Mr. Pedrett also had a great deal to do with the support of the Legislature that put State Potato Inspection on the Statute Books. On a trip that Gus Forsling and "Jake" took to the potato grow - ing section of south Louisiana in 1924, he made many friends among the southern farmers, who still speak of him, although they met him only on that one occasion. On this trip an incident occurred, which his friends joked him about for many years afterward. In the rush to board a train from one southern town to another, he picked up what was presumably his own traveling bag, when a small young woman accosted him and said that he had her suitcase. "Jake", somewhat embarrassed, meekly apologized, and then said, "You would not look so bad in my clothes, but I surely would look a sight in yours.'' The lady enjoyed the comment, as well as did all the others in his party. </seg>

(For photograph when he was president of the Association see report for 1022.) In 1920 he traveled with the demonstration train, which served all of the towns in the pan-handle section of Western Nebraska, as a sort of "better potato" demonstration. Mr. Pedrett was married on March 31st, 1887 to Miss Marie Louisa Grothaus at Hastings, Nebraska. The living children are Ulrich and Harry of Kimball, Fiede Pedrett of Kimball and Louise Pi Burke of Berkley, California. Mr. Pedrett believed very much in higher education, and saw to it that his children were given every opportunity he could afford. All received high school education, his two sons, Ulrich and Harry, attended the Agricultural College of Ne - braska, his daughter, Louise, also attended the State University. He was County Commissioner from 1912 to 1914, and was on the Kimball Farm Association Governing Board in 1914, which in 1915 was merged into one of the first Farm Bureaus in Nebraska, and in which organization he had been active in securing one of the first County: Agents, among whom were George N. Rpwe, R. E. Holland, P. H. Stewart and W. C. Kellog. It was probably through his efforts that Kimball County has had an Agent continuously over these many years past to the present time. He was one of the organ - izers of the Farmer's Union of Kimball County in 1917. He was very public spirited, and spent much of his time as a public citizen.

There may have been plenty of men who made a better showing of material wealth, but none have exerted more and better influence along advancement in farmer's organization in a new and growing country than "Jake" Pedrett did. He was a man of unusual character, and was obviously of most kindly and lovable disposition. His pleasurable wit and unique manner of speaking English made him a popular addition to every assembled meeting he attended. He died very unexpectedly at Kimball on May 6, 1938, only a few days after returning from a long visit with his daughter in California. NOTE OF APPRECIATION BY THE SECRETARY H. O. Werner Jacob Pedrett was the only member or officer with a record of continuous active connection with the work of this association from the time of its inception till his activity was terminated by his death. He always had something to contribute to the meetings which, thanks to his wit, were never permitted to drag very long when he was present. In the early days, when few people were able to visualize the possibilities in a well planned, coordinated program for the produc - tion of better seed and table potatoes, he was essentially an evangel - ist for the cause. He devoted a great deal of time and effort to im - proving- means of producing better potato crops, not only on his farm, but on all the farms of western Nebraska. He realized that any success he might attain individually would be of relatively little con - sequence in comparison with that which might be shared by other families as a result of concerted action. He was not interested in potatoes only for the sake of potatoes or the money they could be sold for. He was interested in the better homes that could be realized as a result of the improvement of the potato crop. He visualized these homes as providing happier and more comfortable surroundings for the members of the family and better educational opportunities for the children. In other words, his greatest interest was in building a more cultured community on the high plains of Nebraska. Mr. young has referred to the numerous enterprises with which .Mr. Pedrett was connected in more or less official capacities. The secretary has received, and is forwarding to the children of Jacob Pedrett, letters of appreciation from a number of people representing agencies in which Mr. Pedrett was interested.

IMPROVEMENT OF QUAUTY IN TABLE POTATOES BY INDIVI - DUAL'AND COMMUNITY EFFORT. Carl Thomas, Mprrill, Nebraska Tiis is a much broader subject than most of us may think. It refers to producing more attractive potatoes, more desirable varieties, more desirable size tubers, as well as elimination of defective potatoes by preventing disease, ill shapen tubers, as well as preventing in - jury in harvesting, storing, loading, and grading. It also refers to packing an attractive pack free from the above mentioned defects, as well as uniformity in size and appearance, and free from dirt and other foreign matter, such as sprouts and roots. I do not understand why I should be limited to table potatoes when I am principally interested in the production of seed. It will be necessary for me to give you a brief resume of the •history of the potato in the North Platte Valley, strictly from my own viewpoint, in order to show some of the improvements that have been made, also some that have not been .made. I shairbegin with about 1907 or 1908 when as a boy I got a job picking potatoes for $1.50 a day, and let me tell you those were the longest days I ever saw, in fact, I believe I could now produce a crop of potatoes in one of those long days. I will not say anything more about that now because it is too large a subject. My first experience in planting potatoes was in the spring of 1911 when my two brothers and I planted behind a walking plow. It seems that this was hard work and yet we accomplished very </seg>
         <seg id="p566">UHI'oHT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE little, and to make things worse our vines grew exceedingly large but they never produced a potato. This is the only experience I have ever had like it. Usually we get potatoes and then we don't know what to do with them. Potato production commenced to develop in the North Platte Valley from about 1905 on, although some potatoes had been pro - duced for a good many years prior to this. In about 1914 or 1915 my father became a large producer of commercial potatoes, produc - ing about four or five acres each year and planting them with a planter, and digging them with a digger. By 1916 he had expanded until he had eleven acres. In these earlier days many varieties of potatoes were grown in this community. Some of these were Triumph, l'earl. Russett Rural, New York Rural, Irish Cobbler, Downing, Early Ohio, King, McClure, Idaho Russett, and perhaps many other varieties. About 1918 or 1919 the Triumph began to Bain prominence, in fact, about this time they came up from just one of our varieties to where they constituted about one half of all potatoes produced in the valley. They rapidly became more prominent thereafter until today you mean Triumphs when you say potatoes out here. It is unnecessary to say that there have been a great many im - provements in the production of potatoes since their first introduction as a commercial crop in the North Platte Valley. However, in the be - ginning we had clean virgin soil, practically free from scab, conse - quently many diseases we now have to contend with were formerly unknown. Perhaps more advancement has been made In harvesting than in any other part of potato production. The first method used was pick - ing in baskets and then dumping the potatoes out of the baskets into wagon boxes in which they were hauled to the cellar or cave. There they were scooped in, usually through slanting ventilators arranged on either side of the cellar at convenient Intervals, the potatoes usually dropping from six to ten feet. Finally we became up-to-date and con - structed cellars with driveways through the center, but we followed Lhe same procedure as before, except that instead of scooping the potatoes in through the ventilators, we now drove into the cellar and scooped them into the bins. We found this to be a great improve - ment as it reduced spoilage considerably. And by the way, I saw this method being used by one farmer as late as 1936. Later we used sacks, picked the potatoes in baskets as before and then dumped two basketfulls in a sack, these half sacks were then gathered up by the truckers and hauled to the cellar where they were dumped into the bins. This method is still in common use by many growers. The latest method, and I believe the best, is the use of picking belts. The pickers have belts to which the sacks are attached and then they pick directly into the sack. These sacks are picked up and hauled </seg>

I will 1 refer briefly only to those which I teel reflect the quality of potatoes. The old time lister type digger, while it did not do too good a job of putting the potatoes on top of the ground, didn't do as thorough a job of shattering the potatoes as do some of the more modern-two apron diggers with about four sets of lively kickers and a twelve inch drop between aprons. Now we have the wide lever bed diggers with very few kickers. In most case diggers are now equipped with motor or power-take-off from tractor. I feel that these new machines are about the last word in potato harvesting, but .most of these level bed diggers should be built longer to permit separation without kickers if possible. Many farmers will tell you they have no trouble separating the potatoes from the dirt, but on observation you will discover that they either run too shallow and cut a great many tubers, or they use too many kickers and have many bruised tubers. : I believe the time has come when the sprayer is indlspensible in the production of potatoes in our section because of the necessity of controlling psyllid and flea beetle. . '¦ We have come a long way in the matter of potato sorters from the old high lift shaker sorter to the new power sorter with elevator and rollers for turning the potatoes so we can look them in the eyes from either side. . As potato production expanded, naturally insect pests and dis - eases became more prevalent. In fact, I believe there are more com - mon enemies of potatoes than there are of any other crop we produce. If it were not for the work that has been done by our College of Agriculture, we might have been eliminated as potato producers. Some of the more common diseases we have to contend with are spindle tuber, fusarium wilt, and psyllid yellows; of these three, fusarium is perhaps the most costly and hardest to control at this time; Many of us can well remember when spindle tuber was our number one enemy. However, when- it comes to quality potatoes we have one that is worse than any I have mentioned, and that is scab, especially our-pit scab. Surely our Agricultural College will solve this little matter for us. Originally we referred to spindle tuber potatoes as "run out" potatoes, and bought new seed or picked out the spindle tuber pieces as we selected our seed. This was im - practical, as any lot containing a noticeable amount of these spindly tubers had a great many tubers carrying the disease without showing </seg>
         <seg id="p568">REPORT OF XEBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICfLTfRIC it. If we bought new seed we usually planted it adjacent to an In - fected field, so we didn't make .much headway until we found out how this disease was spread. Now all we need to do is to plant certified seed and we are sure to be practically free from this disease. This also applies to many other diseases, but not to scab, unless the soil is free from it. As a rule certified seed potatoes have more vital - ity than other seed, for they are usually kept under the most favor - able conditions. If Ido say so myself, I believe that as a group the certified growers are more careful with their potatoes than are the ordinary growers. Now to get strictly to the subject "Improvement of quality of table potatoes by individual and community effort", I feel that we in Nebraska have done as well as any other potato section in keeping up with modern developments in production, and in most cases in the handling of potatoes. In production of certified seed potatoes we have surpassed all other sections. We have advanced from the original bulk loading, through the random weight old dirty bags, the new plain bags, the even weight two bushel bags, to the new even weight one hundred pound branded bag. However, except in a few cases where a limited few dealers have established certain brands, the consumers and dealers who purchase Nebraska table potatoes have no assur - ance as to the quality of potatoes they may expect from a Nebraska pack. I have heard growers make the statement that they used to shovel their spuds into an old bag and sell them for more money than they now receive for their sorted potatoes in new bags. This may be true, but I challenge those growers to go back to their original old pack. Competitors have forced us to come as far as we have, and the sooner we awaken to the fact that we must put up a standard pack that the trade can depend on, the better it will be for all concerned. Let us strive to put up as good a pack as possible. If we can't make the number one grade or the commercial grade, let us make the best we can out of them and then represent them to be what they are. Nebraska potatoes are second to none, but there have been a few dealers and producers who have misrepresented a few off-grade Nebraska potatoes to the detriment of all producers. POTATO GROWING AND RESEARCH IN CENTRAL EUROPE Ora Smith, Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y. Most of you know that potato growing in the Central European countries is a much larger industry than in the United States. They grow many more potatoes and consume several times as many per </seg>
         <seg id="p569">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION 559 capita as we do in this country. Russia, for instance, grows about five times as many potatoes, Germany over four times and Poland over three times as many as the entire United States. Potato growing in Germany is one of the largest agricultural enterprises of that country. Although Germany (before annexation of Austria, Czecho - slovakia, Memel, etc.) was only about 2i/ 3 times the area of Nebraska, it raised approximately 50 times the acreage and 200 times the number of bushels as Nebraska. Probably our first question is "Do these European countries grow large quantities of potatoes because of immense acreages or because of high yields per acre?" Per - haps, it is a result of both large acreages and high yields but most of those countries produce much higher yields than we do in this country. For instance, the average acre yields in Belgium are over 300 bushels per acre, Holland 280 bushels, Germany about 200, Russia 118 as compared with the United States at 112 bushels per acre. It will be of interest, therefore, to review some of the .methods and conditions of potato production and handling in Europe to dis - cover some of the reasons for. their high yields. Unless otherwise specified, the discussion in this article will pertain to potato produc - tion in Germany where we spent most of our time and where most observations and inquiries were made. " Climate Most of the potatoes are grown in. areas where the growing season temperature is relatively »low. The day temperature does not get as high as it does in the Middle West and the warm portion of the season also is of shorter duration than in our corn'belt. In the best potato growing section of Germany the climate is so cool and the growing season so short that most varieties of soybeans and corn cannot reach maturity. ¦¦' '' ' "'' ¦ : '.¦¦•¦-..' : * '"'. ..¦¦¦. ¦ i • I know of no place in Europe where potatoes are grown under irrigation. Although the annual rainfall in Germany is j not as great as in many potato growing sections in this country the distribution of rainfall is such that yields are not often reduced because of lack of moisture. In northeastern Germany, where potato growing is most intensive, five to six inches rainfall usually occurs during July and August and is sufficient during those two month to insure a good crop. ¦/. .'. ¦- •¦¦. '•; '.¦'•¦¦ ' ¦¦"'. ¦..¦'"•'.¦¦'-' . .¦:¦¦'..-"¦ ' ¦'. :' '¦ ¦:' : ¦'-'¦'/ Soils ' - ¦ It was surprising to us to observe the great area of very sandy soil which is devoted to the growing of potatoes especially in north - eastern Germany and Poland. Most potato soils throughout Germany are sandy or sandy loam types with a limited quantity of muck here and there. The Germans do not think that good seed or table stock </seg>
         <seg id="p570">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE can be grown on muck soils and therefore they do not use this type as much as we do in certain states of this country. Much of the best potato land in Holland is a rather heavy clay which formerly was sea bed. They claim that better eating quality scab free tubers grow on clay than any other type of soil. Some sandy soils as well as partial muck soils are also used for potato pro - duction in Holland. Varieties Many more varieties are grown commercially in Germany than in the United States. Pxom 75 to 80 varieties ranging from 71 to 132 days to maturity are grown every year. It is very difficult to keep this large number of varieties from becoming mixed. They check this matter very closely and one division of an experiment station near Berlin is devoted largely to that problem. Many of the varieties are yellow fleshed as they are preferred by .most of the consumers. They also have many varieties with red or blue skin in addition to the white skinned varieties. They grow varieties which are grown distinctly for potato salads. These are long, slender and cheesy in consistency. Continental Europeans as a whole, prefer potatoes for table use which Americans would desig - nate waxy, soggy or firm rather than the mealy type preferred in this couutry. These firm potatoes usually are lower in starch content than the mealy kind. Many of their varieties are much higher in starch content than any grown in America, some ranging as high as 26 per cent starch and many averaging 22 per cent, whereas Amer - ican varieties average about lti to 18 per cent. Those potatoes high in starch, however, are not for table use but for manufacture into starch and alcohol. We were told that ap - proximately one-third of the potatoes of Germany are used for stock feed, one-third for table use and one-third for seed and manufacture of starch and alcohol. The potatoes for stock feed are either made into silage or boiled and fed to livestock particularly .hogs in the proportion of 3 or 4 parts of potatoes to one part of chopped alfalfa hay. During recent years even a greater proportion of the potato crop is being used for alcohol manufacture. Much of this alcohol is being used as fuel and to dilute other fuels such as gasoline, for internal combustion engines. As fuel is very scarce and expensive (gasoline 60 cents a gallon) one might expect that the manufacture of alcohol from potatoes will continue to be a main outlet for the large supply of potatoes. It makes little difference, apparently, whether potatoes used for manufacture or stock feed are small, scabby, with rhizoctonia and otherwise poorly adapted to table use. Probably, as a result of this, the Germans attitude toward disease </seg>
         <seg id="p571">NEBRASKA . POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION and Insect control, spraying, etc. is very Indifferent. Their reason - ing is that a large portion of the potato crop -will be used tor feed - ing and manufacture, therefore, why go to the trouble 'and expense of growing clean stock which would make it no better for feed or alcohol. As we shall see later, practically no seed treatment is prac - ticed for control of scab, or rhizoctonia and spraying is almost un - known. : Manures and Fertilizers . I will not dwell long on this topic because it is one which has not, as yet, caused you in western Nebraska much concern. Where ; potato growing is not conducted ou an extensive basis and where animal manure is available, it is used at the rate of about 12 tons per acre. Usually it is applied in October or November and plowed under.in the fall. In portions of southern Germany, lowever, the manure is applied in the furrow at the time of planting the early potatoes. j One common rate of application of commercial fertilizer is one ton of 4-3-12 or 4-4-14 to the acre. The best growers] in Holland .; apply two tons or commercial fertilizer to the acre. Some apply ; broadcast, others in the rows by hand, before planting. late potatoes | in England are often supplied with 1350 to 1500 pounds of a 7-6-11 j fertilizer to the acre, mostly applied by .hand. A great amount of experimental work is conducted by the ex - periment stations on the relative values of chloride and sulfate forms of potash with most results favoring the sulfate especially for grow - ing seed potatoes. Also many comparisons are made between the ammonia and nitrate forms of nitrogen. The following rotations are some of the most commonly practiced in Germany: I (1) potatoes (manured) (2) potatoes (3) field peas (4) rye seeded with serradella {5) potatoes (manured) (6) potatoes (7) barley (8) red clover (9) pasture (10) rye seeded with serradella.

In eastern Germany the most common is: (1) potatoes (2) rye. .Seed Most potato growers in Europe use larger seed pieces almost all of wliich is planted whole and they plant closer between rows which results in the use of much more seed per acre than by growers in (his country. The average size of seed piece planted in Germany probably is about 3 ounces, which is about twice the size used by many successful growers in the East. From 32 to 40 bushels of seed are planted to the acre in Germany, in England from 28 bushels of the late crop to as high as t?5 bushels for the early crop. Growers in Germany are discouraged from the practice of planting cut seed and all seed in England also is planted whole. Seed of all early var - ieties in Germany and all seed in England is greensprouted before planting. The potatoes to be used for seed are placed in shallow boxes or trays soon after harvest and placed in barns or greenhouses specially constructed for this purpose. Sprouts from % to iy 2 inches long are desired. As all early potatoes in Germany and all potatoes in England are planted by hand it is possible to retain these sprouts during planting. No one ap - parently treats seed potatoes for the control of scab, rhizoctonia or other tuber borne diseases. The English growers find that immature seed results in much higher yields than mature seed of the same stock. Most English growers are in the habit of purchasing seed from Scotland each year. Due to the rapid development of leafroll, mosaic and other virus diseases in Southern and Central England they cannot use the same stock for seed more than a few years. In recent years roguing the fields has been tried instead of obtaining northern seed each year. Some growers think that changing seed from one soil type to another is better than using seed that has been grown on the same soil type several years. For some reason the spread of virus diseases is much slower in Brittany and Jersey so that the same stock can be grown there for many years. It is customary for growers in southern Ger - many to purchase their seed from northern Germany; Belgium from. Xorth Holland and Germany and the Zeeland province of Holland from .North Holland. Planting Potatoes in Germany are planted in rows 24 inches apart, 12 inches between seed pieces in the row of early varieties and 16 inches </seg>

Most planting is done by hand although some machines are used especially in northeastern Germany. Usually the i furrows are opened and places where each seed piece is to be drop - ped are marked with a rather large cumbersome machine, in some cases four rows at a time. If fertilizer is used, it is hen applied by hand and after some mixing with the soil the seed is planted by hand and covered with a middle buster type of plow. ; Harvesting . ',' 1 Practically all early and many late potatoes are harvested by 'hand. In England about 70 per cent are harvested with a middle buster type of walking plow and then scratched out. All potato ; diggers in Europe are of the old obsolete type of spinners and other types which knock or sort of churn the potatoes out of the soil re - j suiting in much bruising and skinning. '¦ ¦"¦ Storing i We did not see any such thing as a commercial potato storage ; house in Europe. With the exception of some of the poiatoes which are to be used for seed all are stored in outdoor pits or as the English I call them, "clamps" or "graves." They are constructed much as we i might store sugar beets, carrots or other root crops for i temporary f period with alternate layers of dirt and straw serving as protection | from cold weather. Marketing !•.' In Germany each month the Government takes note cf the stocks ; on hand and the demand for potatoes and sets a price for the potatoes ! of various grades for the current month. Usually the i prices are ! gradually increased from fall to spring sufficiently to take care of losses in storage due to rot and shrinkage. This removes all possi - bility of speculation on price increases by storing potatoes and mar - keting at any one set.period with the hope of "cleaning up". This system.seems to work very well because during any season of ex - cessive production, prices remain about the same as in i low yield - ing season. In the former case, a laTger portion of thd stock goes into the feeding of live stock or into manufacture. In England the marketing of the potato crop is governed quite strictly .by the Potato Marketing Board which is a :;overnmenal agency. They regulate the supply of potatoes which reach their mar - kets by controlling imports and by specifying the size of tubers which may be offered for sale. If the domestic supply is limited the mini - mum size which they allow to be offered for sale (especially of the early crop) is tubers of three-fourths inch in diameter. If, however, ; the supply is ample it may be declared unlawful to market potatoes </seg>

Diseases The most serious diseases of potatoes in Germany are the virus diseases, mosaic, X and V virus, streak and leafroll. Other diseases of considerable consequence are late blight, scab, rhizoctonia and wart. Apparently they are not troubled with yellow dwarf and spindle tuber, two of our most serious virus diseases. Although Germany was one of the first countries to recognize certified seed stock and the presence of diseases to be considered in certifying seed they are now considerably behind many of our states in this field. It is only comparatively recently that even the workers in the agricultural experiment stations have acknowledged the prom - inence of virus diseases in the degeneration, "running out" or, as the Germans say, the "abbau" of seed stocks. Several prominent investigators are still trying to show that most of the "running out" of seed stock is due to environmental factors such as variety, date of planting, fertilizers, etc. which we consider secondary and of minor importance rather than primary or of major significance. We asked the opinion of many research workers concerning the causes of "run - ning out". The answers ranged all the way from "running out is due entirely to virus diseases" to that of "running out is due to environmental conditions during the growing season". Seed stock in northeastern German;' Is easily kept almost free of virus diseases for indefinite periods. However, the same stock brought to central Germany is completely infested with virus in two or three years and in some instances in one year. At one experiment station in central Germany experiments were being conducted on the rapidity of "running out" of seed stocks by (1) roguing once 12) roguing twice during the growing season compared with (3) roguing early (4) roguing late and (5) no roguing. As you can see, this type of thing has been settled in this country many years ago. Other experiments are set Up to compare the effects on "running out" by fertilizing with nitrates and comparing the muriate and sulfate forms of potash. Results at a prominent experiment station along the lower Rhine River showed that heavy nitrogen application in - creased and hastened "running out" of the stock whereas potash had little effect. On the other hand, in southern Germany it is re - ported that fertilizing with muriate of potash caused much more streak and leafroll than did sulfate of potash; and that nitrate of potash resulted in still less virus. Early planted stock deteriorated more quickly than \ate planted tubers of the same stc;k. </seg>
         <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION We Inspeced a fertilizer experiment with potatoes in central Ger - many of 66 years duration In which there were nine different fertil - izer applications which had been unaltered during: this period. It was interesting to note that the plots which had the least virus diseases were those which during these 66 years had never received any fertilizer application. Practically no spraying.or dusting: for the control of late blight or other diseases is practiced in Germany. In fact, most growers and some experiment station workers are amazed that such t a thing can be done without poisoning the vines, soil, tubers and the people who eat the potatoes. Quite often they have outbreaks of la ;e blight but it usually appears late and they let it take its toll. Their philosophy seems to be that they still have plenty left for food and it is cheaper to have somewhat reduced yields than to pay for investments of spray materials and epuipment. The small distance between rows would make it rather difficult to draw heavy spray equipment through the field without much injury to the vines. . ¦ '" ¦. ' ¦'; / f . ' ' ' The general rule seems to be thai scab occurs rather extensively in sandy types of soil but little in heavier soils. Although scab and rhizoctonia are quite prevalent on the tubers no chemical seed treatment is practiced in niost European countries. The disease which has caused the potato growers of Germany most concern is potato wart. This disease has never been of concern to growers in this country except in a small quarantined area in the coal mining regions of Pennsylvania. German investigators and breeders now have several good varieties of potatoes which are immune to wart. Therefore, in order to stamp out this disease entlrey, the German government has issued orders which will make it unlawful after 1940 to grow any varieties for seed purposes which are susceptible to this disease. Insects About the only insect pest which seems to concern the German growers and investigators is the Colorado potato beetle. Although we look upon this insect as one of the most easily controlled, the Germans are deathly afraid of an invasion of this pest because they do not.spray and have no facilities for spraying or dusting. They are, therefore, attacking this problem by quarantine and by endeav - oring to breed varieties that will be immune to this insect. The beetle exists in most parts of France, and Germany is ac - tually cooperating with the French workers in preventing the spread of this insect and in breeding plants resistant to it. As yet, it is restricted to a small strip of land on the left bank of the Rhine river. At several experiment stations in Germany they have hybrids of commercial potatoes crossed 1 with same of the native South Amer- </seg>
         <seg id="p576">RKI'ORT UF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ican species which are not attacked by the beetle. These hybrids are not yet commercially important. Potato Breeding The Germans depend much more than we do on breeding work lor the control of many of their potato troubles. Formerly, most of the breeding work had been done by the large commercial seed potato growers, most of whom are located in northeastern Germany. They still do a considerable amount of this work. The agricultural experiment stations also are engaged in breeding programs whereby they hope to create varieties which are resistant or immune to most insects and diseases and still retain good quality. Their main pro - pram of breeding now centers on immunity to (1) late blight (2) virus diseases (3) potato beetle and (4) the development of resis - tance to frost. At one large experiment station near Berlin they grow over 250,000 potato seedlings each year and test them for their resistance to the above factors. They have well equipped low temperature greenhouses with controlled temperature and humidity for growing seedlings to test for frost resistance. Holland also is doing very extensive work toward the improve - ment of potato varieties. Much of their work concerns the breeding of varieties immune to the various virus diseases. They are also much interested, however, in the improvement of the cooking quality of potatoes. As new varieties and strains are developed they are sent to about IHO growers situated in all parts of Holland where they are grown on all the important soil types and under various climatic conditions. The growers of Holland are largely very well educated and all excellent cooperators on such projects. With very little supervision from the agricultural experiment stations these seed stocks are grown, the records taken by the farmer and sent to the experiment station. Samples of tuber are also sent to the experiment station for cooking tests and other observations. One hundred and fifty varieties and strains are grown each year at the experiment station at Wageningen where they are tested for immunity to virus diseases. Other Agricultural Research. All agricultural research in Germany has been very markedly changed during the last five years. The main objective in Germany now is to fry to make the country self-sufficient particularly with reference to food supply. Their main excuse for this rather unecon - omic procedure was that in case of war they would be prepared. Almost everything that is being done in Germany today seems to be pointed toward the functioning of the country during the next war. It was obvious to us that Germany is low in supplies of butter, eggs, </seg>
         <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION meats/and edible fats and oils. Great emphasis is being placed by the experiment stations on the possibilities of increasing the supply of vegetable fats and oils for human consumption. Many plants are being raised for seed from which the oil is pressed with the .hope that it can be used in artificial butter making and for cooking. Many kinds of lupines are grown in most parts of Germany—the white, yellow and blue. One experiment station alone is growing 600 strains of this plant. This is a leguminous plant with a fairly large seed and ; a high percentage of oil. It grows well in Germany and is one of their most valuable oil bearing plants. Until recently, however, all varieties of lupines contained a bitter substance which was undesir - able especially for food purposes. They now have found a variety in which this bitter substance is lacking. The call it sweet lupine. It is forbidden that any of this seed be exported from Germany, at least until suffifclent seed is available for the entire country. Rape also is grown very extensively for the oil of the seed. Soybean grow - r ing is just in its infancy in Germany and probably will not be im - .] portant commercially, at least not until varieties are found which are more adaptable to their climate. The season is too short and too cool for .most present varieties. Saffron and many other lesser known plants are also being grown experimentally with the hope that food oil-bearing plants will be found. Much whale oil is now being processed and made edible by the German chemists. ' The Germans are now launched on a four-year program whereby i they hope to farm their land in such an intensive manner that they I shall be able to grow all their own foodstuffs. One research worker (stated, "In regard to the plan of making our country self-sufficient I our vegetable and fruit supply causes us very little worry. Our ; real problem is to locate enough pasture area and to grow an abundant i supply of food- for producing sufficient milk, butter and meats." It I probably Is true that the German people could well exist on their present supply of vegetables and fruits but it would leave many things yet to be desired by the average citizen Of America. For instance, during three, months travel through most of Germany we saw oranges only once. When oranges are scarce or when the ex - change with orange producing countries is unfavorable to Germany they are declared a luxury capable of substitution and therefore un - eaten by the German people. That word "substitute" certainly is overworked in Germany. ; I have mentioned the above experimental work and emphasis on the practical phases of their immediate food problems to remind ; you of the shift from the theoretical to the practical side of research which has recently been accomplished in Germany. There are still | some research problems under way .however, which are not of such .1 immediate practical importance. In southern Germany considerable </seg>
         <seg id="p578">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE work Is being conducted to determine any differences in flavor and cooking quality of potatoes due to nitrogen, phosphorus and potas - sium in various fertilizers. As yet no differences have been detected. Many stations are studying the influence of potash applications on the starch content of potatoes. In most cases unless excessive rates of application are made, potash has decreased the percentage of starch in potatoes. Germany also is troubled with potatoes turning black after cooking. Most workers attribute this darkening to low sup - plies of potash and high supplies of nitrates in soils, although at one southern Germany station they were unable to influence darkening by potash applications. Some work also is being done on the breed- Ing and selection of varieties resistant to scab. One station has ex - periments under way on the effects of various fertilizers, time of harvesting and storage conditions on the vitamin C content of pota - toes. Conclusions The most outstanding differences in potato production and ag - riculture in general between central Europe and the United States are (1) the almost complete absence of labor saving machinery, farm tools, tractors and other equipment (2) the large amount of hand labor used (3) the small average size of farm (4) closeness of plant- Ing and (5) absence of methods for combatting insects and diseases in central Europe. Fuel for use in gasoline engines, trucks, tractors, etc. is very high (almost 60 cents a gallon for gasoline in Germany) therefore, this type of farm equipment is very rare. On one excep - tionally large farm of 1500 acres in central Germany there was not a single truck, tractor or motor operated tool. Instead they had 4 5 horses, dozens of wagons, dozens of single bottom four-wheeled plows and other similar equiment. Most farms, however, are very small (much less than 50 acres) and families are large so that the need for labor saving equipment really does not exist. Farm labor is cheap; we saw many women working on farms, performing duties which any man could do, for 20 to 40 cents a day. So that with cheap hand labor and high cost of fuel such labor saving devices are uneconomical. Although potatoes are produced in such great quantities in Ger - many and a large part of the crop is fed to livestock and manufac - tured into starch and alcohol, potatoes seemed rather expensive. On April 2, 19 38 on a wholesale market in Munich table stock potatoes were selling for $1.30 per 100 pounds and seed stock for $2.00 per 100 pounds. Food as a whole was rather more expensive in Germany than in the United States. </seg>
         <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION VITAL METHODS FOB PRODUCING CERTIFIED SEED POTATOES UNDER IRRIGATION Marx Koehnke i ¦ •' ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ,•'" ¦ ¦¦'"'•¦ ¦'• . ¦ ' • Certification manager, Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative The general program followed by the, grower who produces Certified seed potatoes is essentially the same as that followed by the producer of high quality table stock potatoes in the North Platte Valley. The same methods which will produce good table potatoes will also produce good seed potatoes, with minor variations on cer - tain phases. : In the first place, the potential Certified seed producer must I secure the best seed stock available. This will come from a source j which has been approved for that purpose. In the case of the table stock producer, the majority of such growers will also =ecure certi - fied seed potatoes, or seed potatoes which he considers to be of practically equal quality. "'¦'.. The planting of high quality seed potatoes is not a guaranty, however, that such stock will pass certification. It is necessary that the grower make plans to watch his potatoes!during the season, and to remove any diseased plants which may appear in them. As a general rule, this work, known as roguing, is done by the grower himself. In the past few seasons, a method has been developed whereby commercial roguing may be procured. This custom rouging is generally satisfactory. However, it is well for the grower to check up on the experience of any man who claims that he can rogue potatoes successfully. Some individuals have made false claims for their ability along this line, and have not been able to deliver the goods in this respect. Another matter which is not thoroughly understood by the new grower is the necessity of changing seed more or less frequently. A new lot of seed this year may pass certification satisfactorily, but owing to unfavorable conditions of growth, may have right at the limit of disease, and be rejected the second season that it is planted. The grower under Irrigation will find it desirable to secure a new source of seed about every second year. This does not mean that he will need to plant his entire acreage to new seed each year, but such a ; change-over may be more easily handled in another way. Most of the : older and more successful certified growers in ithe North Platte Valley 'follow the practice of securing a small lot of new seed which they plant in a seed plat, well isolated from any other potatoes. Thislseed plat is thoroughly rogued, and given the best of care in every respect. The production from it will be sufficient to replace the entire prod uc- </seg>
         <seg id="p580">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion in the coming year. In this manner, new seed can be obtained at the minimum of cost, and will give the best measure of assurance that it will pass certification each year. The matter of seed, which has already been discussed, is probably one of the most important phases of certified seed production. It is the principal element of success or failure in certified seed pro - duction. Once the grower purchases a good lot of seed, however, he should not feel that it is going to produce a disease free crop by itself. In addition to the roguing already mentioned, all seed should be treated before planting, for the control of scab or rhizoctonia. Unfortunately, there is no good treatment that will be effective on both diseases. Examination of the potatoes, however, will usually determine which disease is the most serious. Practically all growers are familiar with scab, and if this is present on the potatoes, it is certainly advisable to dip the potatoes for the control of his disease. The most successful treatment for scab is the hot formaldehyde method. There is no need of giving the exact formula for this treatment, because such is available from your County Agent's office, in written form. It may also be secured from the offices of the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooper - ative, both at Alliance or Scottsbluff. One thing is necessary for this treatment, and that is equipment, to maintain exact tempera - tures of water.

         <seg id="p581">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Dipping tanks for this purpose are manufactured by several hardware companies. Such dipping may also be performed by men who do custom work of that nature. The dipping process should be completed six weeks or more before actual planting time, because it arrests sprout growth to a certain extent. I The main precaution to be followed when treating by the hot formaldehyde method; is treatment before the sprouts are of any length. Potatoes that have been sprouted badly should never be treated until the sprouts have been removed. A number of cases have been known where the potatoes have heated, as a result of treating potatoes badly sprouted, and their value as seed potatoes was thereby considerably reduced. The matter of time of planting for certified seed production is another important point. Generally speaking, the average time of planting for table stock production will be found to be satisfactory i with certified seed production. If the grower finds that he is ; troubled with stem rot, or scab, when early plantlng'is practiced, he should by all means plant somewhat later than the usual date of planting in his locality. In some sections that are troubled with scab each year, it is probably undesirable to attempt growing potatoes of any kind. If a new grower is contemplating production, it will be well to talk to older growers in the neighborhood, to learn their ex - periences in that regard. Generally speaking, the best average time for planting in the North Platte Valley will be after the 10th of June Some growers will wait until the latter part of June for planting, but such late dates are apt to cause trouble with hot soil of the seed' bed, and consequent loss of seed in the ground. As a general rule, it: will be necessary to make somewhat dif - ferent plans for seed production when determining the rate of plant - ing. Since large potatoes are not desirable for seed, and in many cases must be sorted out because they are larger than 12 ounces it is desirable to do, everything possible to keep down the size of the potatoes. In order to keep the size down, and the production up growers will find it necessary to plant the potatoes close together in the row, and to increase the amount of seed put on an acre of potatoes. On good rich land, that has been well fertilized, and is able to produce between 400 and 500 bushels per acre, not less than 25 bushels per acre should be used for seed. A good many growers who are successful producers have increased this rate as much as ten bushels per acre. Increasing the seed rate any more has not been found to be of great advantage. During the summer, the best methods of cultivation and irriga tion are most desirable for certified seed production. Past exper ience has pointed to the fact that once irrigation Is commenced! the </seg>
         <seg id="p582">UKI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE plants should never be allowed to stop growing again. In the past season, when the water shortage was faced, certain growers found their water shut oft, the crop stopped growing for awhile, and there was apparently an increase of stem rot in such fields. The best method of irrigation is frequent and light irrigations. By this means. there is never any over-watering, and the plants are kept growing steadily. The matter of spraying for the control of insect pests will also be given further consideration by another speaker. Growers used to feel that it was not necessary to spray, however, each season points to the greater necessity of controlling 1 insect pests in potato fields. Certain insect pests, such as grasshoppers, are known to spread disease from plant to plant within the field. From the standpoint of the certified potato grower, the control of such insects, and consequently, of the disease, is a very important factor. A number of years ago, a campaign was put on among certified potato growers, and later, among all potato growers, for better methods of harvesting. The reason for this campaign was the ex - cessive damage that was being done during the process of harvest - ing. Every phase of harvesting was carefully scrutinized, from the construction of the digger, to packing, hauling, and emptying into the bins in the cellar. As a result of this campaign, most growers were very conscious of harvest damage. It has always seemed like the height of folly for a lot of potatoes to be practically U. S. No. 1, under the ground, becoming 50% culls in the cellar. Such dam - age was very frequent, while now, among certified potato growers especially, it is not at all uncommon to find less than 10% damage in any cellars of potatoes at the time of bin inspection. Because of the fact that growers are fairly familiar with good methods of harvesting, only passing mention need be made of the principal points of caution. In the first place, a level bed digger is by far the most desirable. However, it will not dig the potatoes without damage unless it is properly handled. Many growers with old type diggers are doing an excellent job, because they realize it's limitar tions, and work accordingly. Following the digging, it is usually desirable to allow the potatoes to dry for two hours, or as long as possible, before picking. If there is an extremely hot sun which might cause sun scald, potatoes must be picked up within 30 minutes. The old method of picking potatoes in wire baskets, has prac - tically changed to padded baskets, or what is known as the picking belt method. In most cases, the latter method is probably the most desirable, as the potatoes are packed directly into the sacks, which are then loaded and hauled to the cellar. </seg>
         <seg id="p583">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION ; • The method of picking up these sacks In the field, placing them on trucks or wagons, is also very important. Such sacks must be carefully picked up, and carefully set on the trucks, ratheV than toss - ed thereon. In this respect, the pickers can be of assistance, if they are instructed not to put more than 30 to 40 pounds in the sack. Larger quantities of potatoes in a sack are more likely to be i mis-handled, either on or off the truck. The truck bed of course : should be well padded. ' : The last point, that of placing the potatoes in the bin, must not Ibe neglected. The potatoes may' easily be rolled out of the sack, rather than dropped or thrown thereby avoiding another source of trouble. More might be said concerning harvesting methods, but this should be sufficient for this time. ! Since certified seed potatoes do not go on the market until late in the winter, proper storage conditions are very desirable. For the first two or three weeks after harvest, an adequate supply of mois - ture, to provide high relative humidity, should be prov ded in the potato cellar. Excessive ventilation should be avoided. In order to prevent the sweating in,the tops of bins, the potatoes on the top of the bin should be kept as level as possible. The emperature should be kept relatively high, that is, 50 to 600 F. for two or three weeks. This combination of high humidity and high[ .moisture, materially assists the healing of bruised and badly feathered potatoes. Following this curing period, the temperature is dropped to between 3G to 40°. It is not desirable to hold the temperatures nuch below that point, because difficulty with cracking may be experienced when it is time to sort potatoes. Every other point of storing and later handling should have this one thing in mind, that of keeping the quality and condition of the potatoes to the best possible point. Each certified potato grower should strive to keep his potatoes in a con - dition to yield the greatest percentage of U. S. No. 1 grade, at time of sale.

         <seg id="p586">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD &lt;j)F AGRICULTURE One last point for the non-certified grower. Many potatoes are cold as being "from" certified stock. Probably very few lots in the North Platte Valley could now be traced and found not to be "from" certified seed. This doesn't mean a thing if this "from" indicates several years ago. As I pointed out before, 'the rank vine growth and increasing insect population mean that without proper care, diseases will increase very rapidly In irrigated fields. It is impor - tant to realize that all certified seed potatoes bear official tags. The certification department will not verify the identity of any lot of potatoes moved from it original storage if it isn't tagged! From 1931 to 1937 Inclusive, the average yield of all potatoes in Scottsbluff and Morrill Counties was 151 bushels per acre. The average yield of certified potatoes for the same period was 230 bushels per acre. This speaks very well for the quality of certified potatoes and for the ability of the growers who raise Nebraska Cer - tified Potatoes. : MARKETING QUALITY NEBRASKA POTATOES Bill Richards I am very sorry that Mr. Jones was called away and therefore unable to address this meeting as per Prof. Werner's program. It was only yesterday that the Professor asked me to take up and carry on. It is presumed that one can talk freely on any subject that he enjoys. I don't know about the talking part but I do know that I enjoy selling, having done so for 30 years. For years in this industry many minds have been devoted largely to the problems and processes of production. The results in that direction are encouraging and gratifying. But the grower doesn't produce potatoes solely for his own table and since the days of bar - ter are no more (except in Germany) some factors must enter the picture and convert this new wealth into money to the benefit of growers and the community. It has often been said that an article is only worth what it will sell for, regardless of what the owner may otherwise believe. In every producing district from coast to coast you hear, "Well, we have always been able to sell and move our crops", that has been partially true. Don't misunderstand me, for there is an outlet, real or tem - porarily artifical, for all grades and packs, and it is surprising in many instances what little the jobbers and wholesale receivers ac - tually know as to specific potato grades. For that reason, deception or its equivalent If often practiced and a nice profit is turned in, but those deals do not move the crop. Quite often such deceptive quotations establish a ceiling for the true quality they are presumed </seg>

Basically the responsibility for moving the crop is on the shoulders of the shipper, whether an individual, a firm, a corporation, or an association. In the process the first essential step is the grading and packing or packaging. The shipper must do the Job and to promote and protect his own interest he must follow the merchandise through the broker, jobber, and the retail &gt;r to the con- Burner.

'./ .: :'-'- ¦ ¦- -H'V:' :V -: T"¦ " l.*hf.--i :yh.{&lt;.- ¦ We became acquainted with the insect in Nebrasku. In 1931 and 1932, at which time there was a fairly heavy infestation. Theße insects caused very heavy losses in western Nebraska in 1935, but practically no damage in 1936 and 1937. The payll id infestation in 1938 was one of the most serious infestations that has been ob - served in Nebraska. Many people have estimated that psyllids caused at least a one-fourth reduction In yield in the commercial potato growing sections or a loss of 1,000,00 bushels. Most iarden patches of potatoes throughout central and eastern Nebraska Were Just about ¦i a complete failure even though weather condition were favorable for potato production. v a ; : Until this year psyllids were thought of as a Ricky Mountain insect, but in the summer of 1938 they were found throughout Ne - braska as far east as the Missouri river. Psyllid infestations were reported from New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, and CBnada&gt; Fields of ten. acres or more in central and eastern Nebraska did not seem to be damaged badly but the smaller patches were a ft ilure. The infestation in western Nebraska was heavies: in the North ' . Platte Valley and the: dry land sections of Bannei and Kimball [¦'¦¦ counties'. There was a heavy infestation on early planted potatoes in Box Butte and other counties to the north. There was a light in - festation on the late planted to potatoes in the dry land sections to I the north the latter part of July and the fore part oti August. Dur - j ing the middle of August the number of psyllids decreased very rapidly and the situation did not seem as serious as it had in July. This waß probably due to the high temperatures in early August, List—, having shown that temperatures of 96°-100° are very i unfavorable for psyllids.* Conditions seemed to be veiy favorable lot the insects in September as an unusually heavy infestation occurred and a great deal of damage was done during the last few weeks of the growing season. The moisture supply and temperature were Ideal for tuber production but there seemed to be very little tuber : growth after the middle of September.^ The symptoms of psyllid pre - valence did not appear on top* of the plants as they did in the early part of the growing season even though dozens of psyllids occurred on individual plants, i/v, i : V 3 In April 1939, VTm. Morrow found many peylllda on potato plants in the Rio Grande Valley In the vicinity of BrownsvlUe, Texa* „i / A 4 List, G. M.

         <seg id="p590">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The reduction in yield was not the only loss. The excessive sprouting in the cellar caused heavy shrinkage and extra labor in sorting to Bhipping time. The loss will no doubt be carried over to the coming season. Seed stock will be much harder to keep in good condition until planting time. Every possible method should be used to keep seed potatoes in good shape. One of the things that will aid is cold storage where possible. Sprouting may be delayed by ventilation by placing potatoes in a thin layer, of in sackß. : We are often asked if seed from fields infested with psyllids is suitable for planting. Indications are that the disease caused by the insects does not carry over through the potatoes. Other factors, such as small size or excessive sprouting may cause a decreased vigor of seed stock. Control ; ¦-.'•,.".¦:¦ Gillett, Colorado, worked out a control in 1904 for controlling psyllids on tomatoes.i List, in Colorado, did further control work and recommended 1-50 lime-sulphur.s The Colorado people advised the spraying of potatoes with 1-40 lime-sulphur solution in 1928 and that is still recommended at this time. . In view of experiences of recent years it now seems that the best practice may be to spray early potatoes when they are from 6 to 8 inches high. The first application may be put on as an insurance. If psyllids continue to be present it will be necessary to spray throughout the summer making two or three sprayings. A few pre - cautions must be observed: (1) Thoroughness of cover, the first psyllids appear on the lower leaves and unless the leaves are covered thoroughly, complete control cannot be obtained. ; . • . (2) The nozzes should be so arranged that the spray material will cover the lower side of the leaves. It may be necessary to put longer pipes on the boom in order to lower the. nozzles. ''. "•¦; (3) The type of the ridge will have some effect. The wide ridge which many growers prefer may obstruct the spray. ¦ . It is not possible to tell you at this time if a psyllid infesta - tion will occur. Adult psyllids have been found on cedar trees in several counties in central Nebraska. These adults were still in - good Bhape in February and March. If something does not happen to destroy them, we are very likely to have an infestation. 5 List, G. M.

         <seg id="p591">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION BACTERIAL RING HOT OF POTATO HAS BEEN FOUND IN .' '"¦ -¦;¦.; : ¦'. NEBRASKA ¦' ' ;\'-: : James H. Jensen, Associate Plant Pathologist, Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station It would seem that we have enough disease trouble to talk about in potatoes Without having to go out of our way to find a new disease which hardly any of you have seen. No doubt all of you have had your difficulties during the past year with scab and fusarlum wilt, as well as psyllld yellows, which altho it is caused by the feeding of an insect is sometimes referred to as a disease. In addition to these troublesome diseases, however, we are faced with a new disease and one that has caused heavy losses in other sections. I would like to bring to your attention some of the things we have learned about this new disease. I refer to bacterial ring* rot which has been found in several lots of uncertified potatoes here in western Nebraska. To begin with, let me say a tew things about the history ot this disease. It was first reported about 1913 in Germany. The first mention of this disease in the United States occurred about 1932, when it was reported from Maine. Bacterial ring rot has caused losses as .high as 50.% of entire fields in Maine. I don't need to emphasize its seriousness when you realize that you may harvest bushels of what seem to be healthy potatoes only to find when you get ready to ship that instead ?of potatoes you will have bins full of rotted mush. At the present time it is known to occur in Canada, in Maine, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Florida. It is very easy for us to realize that with the disease known to occur in such widely separated places, it also, probably occurs in some of the areas in between. A more extensive survey will be undertaken this summer to determine more accurately the exact distribution of the disease. For the present, however, let us discuss the symptoms of this disease and how it may affect our own potato industry, and what we must do to control it. To begin with, the Bymptoms of the disease appear late in the growing season and the first symptom of the disease is a rolling and a wilting of the leaves on diseased plants. The leaves,; feel thin and soft, if you touch them. These symptoms, of course, are very similar to the effects of hot, dry weather and will make it very difficult, as far as symptoms are concerned, to distinguish diseased plants from plants suffering from drought here in western Nebraska.. Along with the rolling, the leaves partly turn yellow and show a marginal leaf burning and witing and the leaves die much earlier than usual Affected stems are stunted to some extent. From the infected stems </seg>
         <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 582 the bacteria enter the potato tuber through the stolons and spread along the vascular ring In the tuber. Now one of he very difficult things to visualize is the fact that at digging time the diseased tubers may or may not show symptoms of rot. If they do show symptoms, the discoloration will be creamy or lemon-yellow, yellower than in the case of fusarium stem-end rot; the flesh in the discolored area of the tuber will be crumbly and cheesy. The rot in its earlier stages is odorless. If you squeeze a tuber after the stem end has been cut off, the diseased tubers will many times separate along the line of the vascular cylinder. Eventually a rot develops character - ized by cavities in the vascular system. In fact, the rot many times progresses to such a point that there is a mere shell of the outer portion of the potato left. Secondary organisms, of course, may follow and produce various types of decay in diseased tubers. Now the fact that the symptoms of the plant in thie field will be very difficult to distinguish, and also that it may be also almost im - possible to tell whether or not tubers are diseased at digging time, makes this disease a .much more difficult one to work with than those with which we are now familiar, such as scab, stem-end rot, etc. When you add these difficult points to the fact that the only control for the disease is the absolute elimination of the diseased lots of potatoes as a seed source, you will see the difficulty that we are going to have. It means that we will have to make sure in our identification of the diseased plants. So don't be surprised next sum - mer if inspectors, and others, come into your fields with razor blades and make sections of your potato stems on. glass slides for further, examination in the laboratory. That is the only means we have of checking our observations absolutely. : As I mentioned above, the control of the disease consists in not using infected potatoes for seed stock. This means that if there are any diseased plants in a field, potatoes from that field should not be used for seed. It is impossible to tell the diseased potatoes, the rot may not show up until late in the storage period. The disease can be disseminated by the cutting knife, bacteria may overwinter possibly on the outside of tubers which have been smeared by rotted tubers, and so we will have to just eliminate completely any lots of potatoes which have any disease in them at all. At the present time the lots of potatoes which do contain diseased tubers are being dis - posed of entirely as table stock and will not be replanted. ' We do not know how long the organism will overwinter in the soil, but certainly it would be a safe recommendation that if diseased plants are found in your field, the land should not be used for potatoes for several years. There is a possibility that the disease may spread by irrigation water. With the disease in its early dis- </seg>
         <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION tribution here In Nebraska, and probably limited to a very small per - centage of our seed stocks, it seems possible that we may be able to eliminate bacterial ring rot entirely from the state. Thiß we can do only with the cooperation of everyone. However, It means frlst of all that all seed stock must be healthy. In this| connection, I am sure we can take care of the certified stock, but we have no control over seed stock brought In .from out of state. You men who grow table stock and who buy out-of-state seed, will have to watch carefully if you want to keep this disease out of your fields. If you have samples of potatoes which resemble these I have here for your ¦ observation, either send them into the College of Agriculture or get in touch with the inspectors for the Certified Potato Growers, who will be very glad to take care of them.

         <seg id="p594">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE A potato Club contest was held at Alliance, November 5. Nine - teen club members took part in the contest. Laural Dickinson of Scottsbluff County was the highest ranking member in the contest. A banquet was served to the contestants, leaders, and county agents. The five best potato samples were sent to Chicago. The exhibit was awarded two red and three white ribbons. Three carloads of certified seed potatoes were shipped from Scottsbluff County by 4-H Potato Club members to 4-H Potato Club members in Louisiana. Mr. Nibler, County Agent, and Mr. Hobart worked with the club members in assembling the loads and in other work. Three result demonstrations were established to show the value of using disease free seed and the value of the various varieties. The demonstrations were conducted In Buffalo, Merrick, and Pierce Counties. To further 4-H Potato Club work in Nebraska and to promote better relations with potato growers in Louisiana, I feel that it would be advisable for the Nebraska Potato Improvement Assoc - iation to offer a trip for the Nebraska 4-H Potato Club Champion to Louisiana at the time of their Annual Potato Tour. If arrange - ments could be made to have the club member make the trip with some one who made the southern trip to inspect seed plants, the ex - penses should not exceed $50. If the trip were made by rail, the trip should not exceed ?80. A 4-H club member should hot make such a trip without proper supervision. Other phases of the work in which the association may cooperate and the expenditures sug - gested are as follows: 4-H Prizes, banquet, and mileage ? 80.00 Production contest 35.00 Demonstration plats 10.00 Exhibit at Ak-Sar-Ben 20.00 $165.00 The assistance given the extension service in furthering educa - tional work was appreciated and it Is hoped that the help will be given in the future. </seg>

         <seg id="p605">NRBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION &#132; the "hair sprout" situation. This trouble had shown up to a very serious extent in the southern plantings of Triumph potatoes coming from certain northern states. . It may have been more prevalent than . usual in Nebraska seed, yet it was not nearly as serious as in the seed from states.to the northeast. &lt; In the early part of April, 1938, a conference was held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for the purpose of drawing up a set of seed cer - tification standards upon which southern seed buying land northern seed producing states could agree. The conference was attended by representatives from 18 states and by several specialists of the U. S. Department of. Agriculture. The conference was well organized and devoted two days to consideration of problems involved. A ¦] set ot standard specifications was adopted by the conference for recommen - dations to officials in various states. A report of the conference was J published in the American Potato Journal for Vol. 15, Pages 130-140, May, 1938, Nebraska was officially represented at this conference by Mara Koehnke, Certification Manager, and Drs. R. W. Gosa and H. 0., Werner of the Seed Certification Committee of the College of Agri - culture. ¦ ¦ "¦ ¦ . ¦¦ ¦ . . . ' • ¦ .;¦ : .¦ The above mentioned delegation inspected the Nebraska certified seed potato trial plot planted with the cooperation of Henry Darling at Fairhope, Alabama. This was a very satisfactory plot because of the uniform growth and very good cultural conditions, "i Very little hair sprout was found in Nebraska stocks. The condition of the stocks with regard to mosaic was very ¦ satisfactory. At; the time of the inspection of this field.a cold''¦wavecame downfromthe north - west that brought the'-temperature"-down to 36 to 39° F, a dangerous point with Nearly potato, plants two feet tall. ? During the numerous conferences in the fields' at Baton Rouge and Fairhope, many theories were discussed as to the cause of hair 'sprout, but no one had any evidence as to its cause or control. The southern potato selling' market was very erratic, prices vary - ing abruptly and somewhat unpredictable The selling of commercial qauntlties of White Rose potatoes, ia competition with those from California and with southern Triumphs, introduced a factor that may be of serious concern to Nebraska growers of Triumph seed potatoes. Another development in the south was the promotion: by the Louisiana Agricultural College of plantings of Katahdin potatoes. It is thought ' that this variety will produce table potatoes that can be held for home use longer than can the Triumph potatoes, thus making it un - necessary for Louisiana to buy potatoes within a few weeks after the Triumph shipping-season is over. - : ' i Rainfall in western Nebraska during April and May raised the hopes of dry-land potato growers higher than they had been for some time. Among the most optimistic was Jacob Pedrett who returned </seg>
         <seg id="p606">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE to western Nebraska after having spent the winter with a daughter tn California. All of his friends were startled by news of his sudden death on May 6, only 6 days after hfs .return to Kimball (see pages A to 9). ' ¦¦'¦¦¦ •¦';'¦¦;.;;;;vV; The potato season in the central and eastern part, of Nebraska started off under very favorable conditions and seemed very promis - ing. However, by mid-June, when early fields should have had large potatoes in considerable quantity, many fields were found to be destitute of potatoes. As a general rule, small farm patches of po - tatoes all over the state were pretty much of a loss. The cause of Portable car cooling equipment in operation at Gibbon during the potato shipping season of 1938. this trouble was undoubtedly due to a serious state-wide infestation of psyllids. On a trip from western Nebraska to Lincoln in late June, extension specialist T. H. Hankins found psyllids on all potato and tomato fields Inspected, and continuing east they were found in great numbers in patches in and around Omaha and Nebraska City. Following several hot days in early July, it was difficult to find psyllids in these fields, but many had been ruined by that time. This was the first time this pest was observed to be doing damage that far east. - ¦ '¦¦/¦• ¦¦"• ¦'¦ ¦ ; ,: .'•'.' ¦ In addition to psyllids—grasshoppers did an unusual amount of damage to potatoes in the extensive early district around Gibbon. In that region, yields were not nearly as satisfactory as in he previous year and prices were not very satisfactory until some federal agencies started making .extensive purchases. In 1938 a number of ¦ cars ¦¦ot </seg>
         <seg id="p607">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION potatoes were washed and precooled before shipping. Results were sufficiently encouraging so that this may be expected to become an established practice (see picture). In western Nebraska temperature conditions were favorable for psylllds so that infestations during July were very serious and general. Tie early potatoes in western Nebraska were very unsatisfactory be^ - cause of psyllid damage. An extensive amount of spraying was done. About 132,000 gallons of lime-sulphur were sold so it seems likely that 30,000 acres were sprayed at an estimated cost of $1.10,000 for materias and labor. (This Included about 100,000 pounds of lead arsenlte added for other insects). After the first few days of August the number of psyllids found on plants seemed, to be decreasing as time moved on so that by mid-August only a few nymphs and very few eggs could be found. Then by the 20th to 25th of August the numbers again seemed to be increasing. They continued to increase so that by mid-September and from then on more psyllids were found - on plants than had ever been observed in recent years in western Ne - braska (see pages 33). ¦¦&#132;¦¦;.:¦;¦,! .¦¦¦¦ ,¦.¦¦.,¦•:,.,..¦¦' After mid-August, tusarlum wilt became very serious resulting in the heaviest rejections for this cause in the history of seed certi - fication in Nebraska. In addition to that, one of the' most devasting epidemics of early blightever observed in Nebraska: killed the tops in many western fields during a few rainy days in the early part of September. In view of the seriousness of this blight damage it was very surprising that during the storage season there was little evi - dence of damage to tubers. • In view of all these difficulties with psyllids, blight and. wilt, yields of potatoes were severely curtailed and-no one qualified for membership in the "Nebraska 400 bushel potato club" in 1938. The irrigation wells put down in 1937 oh several dry-land farms were used with gratifying results in 1938. Some additional welte were put down and used in 1939. In all dry-land districts, quite a few fields of potatoes were grown on summer fallowed land. As a result of both these methods, the volume of potato; production in Nebraska is being stabilized. i This year there was much interest among growers in the potato tour again resumed by the Nebraska Certified Potato Grower's Co - operative. During, August the annual field conferences of potato specialists in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska, were held at Pine Bluffs, Cheyenne, and Laramie, Wyoming. Three of these conferences have been held and they are of great value to all workers and thereby to the growers In these three states. Psyllids and bacteria ring 'rot were the major subjects given consideration. During August the potato research workers in Nebraska, had a two-day field conference </seg>
         <seg id="p608">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in western Nebraska with Dr. H. A. Jones, Dr. Dykstra, and Mr. Schull of Washington, D. C. and W. C. Edmundson of Greeley, Col - orado, but all of the D S. D. A. potato division. v With the promotion of Dr. R. W. Goss to the chairmanship ol the Department of Plant Pathology in the University of Nebraska, Dr. James Jensen, a graduate of the College, was brought back to Ne - braska to take active charge of the field work with potatoes. He was stationed in Scottsbluff during the summer of 1938. After acting as superintendent of the Scottsbluff Field Station since the death of James Holden, Lionel Harris was appointed as superintendent of the station during the spring of 1938. The agricultural research work in western Nebraska suffered a serious loss in the death of Leslie Bowen, irrigation engineer of the U.S. D. A. who died on August 26. His death was considered a great personal loss to those who had had the opportunity of knowing him. During the summer of 1938 an attempt was made to grow White Rose seed potatoes in western Nebraska. Results have not been very encouraging. This variety does not seem adapted to the climatic con - ditions encountered. The tubers produced were not of good type and their cooking quality was Inferior. The new early variey.Earlalne, was tested by the Horticultural Department of the Agricultural Col - lege at several places, but does not seem desirable for Nebraska. The new varieties, Mesaba (early white) and Pontiac (drough endur - ing red), on the basis of small tests do seem quite promising and" will be tried more extensively in 1939. Tie growing of Kathadin has been considered so as to supply seed for the south. For this pur - pose, it seems about as satisfactory as the latest types of Triumph po - tatoes. : y. ¦-\ .-:'.¦ :¦:.'••¦'¦;' ;¦.- ¦'-¦ . On January 20 the Association president, Dwayne Walrath, called a conference of about 40 leaders in all phases of the potato industry in western Nebraska. This conference met in Scottsbluff and devoted an entire day to the discussion of problems then confronting the industry or likely to confront it soon: A report of this conference is printed on page 40. The consensus of opinion was that the conference was very worthwhile and that similar conferences should be held in future years. . • ; Potato growers in the late potato producing states were given an opportunity in July to vote on whether or hot they approved of a nation-wide potato marketing agreement such as was carried out in 1937. Nebraska growers voted about 10 to 1 against the proposed measure. This adverse vote in Nebraska was probably the most im - portant factor in defeating the proposition as a national project. </seg>
         <seg id="p609">•NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION : During the winter shipping season (1938-39) many growers en - countered trouble with early and extensive sprouting. .This was to be expected ia view of the severe and common infestation of psyllids late in the season. Some growers had much trouble In getting the certified, seed; pack to meet blue tegrequlrements.-,The potatoes In the car showed higher percentages of mechanical damage than in the bin. -The trouble was finally diagnosedas being due to injuries re - ceived when grading and packing the potatoes. When potatoes are stored in cool humid cellars, they lose very 'tittle; weight and remain very turgid. It has also been discovered that potatoes that are warmed up to about 500 p for a week or so before sorting are not damaged as much when graded and sacked as do potatoes stored at 36 to 40° F. It'¦.may be very desirable to revise methoda of handl - ing potatoes In .midwinter. As a result of correspondence; concerning problems of storage and storage house construction betweenHHr. r O. Werner and A. D. Edgar, storage engineer of the /U. S. D. A. at '.Cadillac', Michigan, the latter made a trip to western Nebraska in February to study the problems of storage construction. A number of the storage owners secured some valuable suggestions from Mr. Edgar. Planß are underway to have Mr. Edgar transferred to western Nebraska to Btudy these storage construction problems. Such studies should prove of great value to the potato industry for present types of storage do not seem entirely satisfactory. : A rather distinct departure in potato marketing was initiated by one of the large distributors. Triumph potatoes were washed, care - fully sorted and sold in consumer size packages in selected cities where extensive sales campaigns were put on. The demand for these potatoes indicated that if properly graded, Triumph potatoes pro - duced in western Nebraska can compete advantageously with those from any other source. Thiß is encouraging/in view of the high power advertising campaigns that the states of Maine and Idaho are staging that may accentuate, competition. The present difficulty Is to procure a sufficient quantity of potatoes of high quality in western Nebraska to maintain a constant supply on the markets.. This is an opportunity for alert growers. One of the most disconcerting de - velopments of the last year, was the discovery within the last few weeks that the bacterial ring rot disease exists in some lots of Ne - braska seed potatoes^ This'disease has caused serious trouble along the Atlantic Coast; Just how serious or widespread It will be with us no prieican tell, now. 1 However, as the southern- states will not permit 'any tubers infected with this disease in certified seed coming into their states and as it may be difficult to detect, it promises to constituteanother-seriousproblemfor Nebraska growers. At this writing (March 1939) crop prospects in most dry land counties are fair to good, fall rains having been greater than average </seg>

Unanimously adopted. A discussion followed concerning the desirability of the Nebr. Potato Improvement Association participating in the: publication of "Better Potatoes" which was started during the past year by the Nebr. Certified Potato Growers Cooperative. It seemed desirable to have this organ apply more widely to the potato industry of the state. Various aspects were discussed from the standpoint of this Associa - tion and from the standpoint of the certified seed business. As a re - sult of the discussion the concensus of opinion seemed to be that the Potato Improvement Association should publish this paper under the name of the Association with Marx Koehnke continuing as editor. That if such publication were undertaken an effort should be made to enlist the interest of growers who are not now certified seed potato growers. It was deemed advisable to defer final action until the matter could be discussed with the Directors of the Nebraska Certi - fied Potato Growers Cooperative.

The 1939 Nebraska State Poultry Show was held in the City Auditorium at Omaha, Nebraska, January 3rd to 7th, inclusive. This Show was known as the Erie Smiley Memorial Show in honor of that fine Nebraska man who passed away in the prime of life. The Show was indeed a wonderful one. Excellent quality was shown throughout. The birds came from sixteen states. The National White Rock meet brought out a marvelous display of White Rocks, The judging was done by Judge Harry Atkins of Davenport, lowa, and our own Fred Lipps of Columbus, Nebraska. Satisfaction pre - vailed throughout the show, and some eight hundred birds were passed upon. The Hatchery class was unusual again this year. Many fine specimens were shown. The State Show for 1940 was awarded to Hastings, Nebraska. The election of officers was the same as last year with the exception of Sam W.
