The value of the hay and forage crop of the United States best be shown by reciting a few facts taken from, the Agri- cultural Statistics given in the report of the Twelfth Census, where it is shown that in 1899, out of a total valuation for all - of $2,910,138,663, the value of the hay and forage crop is $481 •), or 16.6 per cent. The value of this crop is greater than that of any other with the single exception of corn, which had a valuation that year of $828,258,326. From the same source we find that out of a total valuation of for all crops grown in Nebraska in 1899, the for- age crop was $11,230,901, or 12.2 per cent.
