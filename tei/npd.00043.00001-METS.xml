            <seg id="p003">OFFICE OF STATE LIBRARIAN Lincoln, Nebraska, December 20, 1918. To the Honorable Keith Neville, Governor of Nebraska. As required by law I herewith submit my report as librarian of the Nebraska State Library for the biennium ending December 1, 1918. From the rej&gt;ort it will be seen that on December 1, 1916, there were 72,991 regularly accessioned volumes in the library. During the biennium 1,353 volumes have been purchased, 671 volumes received by donation and 936 volumes received on exchange, making a total of 75,951 volumes on hand on November 30, 1918. The report also shows that the library has on hand for sak&gt; 28,113 volumes of Nebraska supreme court reports, the selling price o which is fixed by statute at $2 per volume. l&gt;uring the bienninm 1,481 volumes of such reports have been sold, the proceeds paid to the state treasury and by him placed to the credit of the library fund for the purchase of books. The legislature of 1917 appropriatel the sum of $500 for bookcases and shelving which sum has been expended iu the erection of five steel stacks on the tops of the wooden ftiieks in the east end of the main library room. There is not another available foot of bookshelf space in the library, and the time has arrived when the library activities will be most seriously crippled unless additional room is provided. Two years ago, in your inaugural address, your Excellency directed the attention of the legislature to the unsafe, crowded condition of the capitol building, urged that measures be taken to provide for the construction of a new building and stated that "It would be folly for the legis - lature to adjourn without having taken remedial measures." It is a matter of common knowledge that the Senate by unanimous vote declared itself in favor of the construction of a new capitol building and that 75 ]&gt;er cent of the membership of the House voted in favor of beginning its construction and yet, in the closing hours of the session. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 petty personalities were so indulged in by our legislators tluit they committed the "folly" mentioned by you ami ad - joniued withonl having taken remedial measure* to provide for tlie safety of tlie state's property. While it is true that the eapito] building is crowded in all departments it would Men that the library, worth half a million dollars, uninsured, and exposed to the cver-pres ent danger of destruction by fire should receive the (irst at - tention of the state's exei ntire offices and &lt;&gt;f the legis - lature. I'nless a new and separate building for the bpc of the rapreme court and state library is to he built, the first wing for tic new capitol should l&gt;e planned for the perma - nent quartern of the library and the work so pushed that the library may be installed therein at the earliest possible date. The taxpayer* of Nebraska have demonstrated all through the grant war that they aie ready and willing to, give freely and generously where the public good demands it. It is the waste of public funds that is criticized, not ex - penditures: for legitimate, needed purposes. Kveryone who has given the matter any thought agrees that good, sound business judgment demands that the state should take immediate steps for the protection and care of its great library and when we stop to consider that a one mill levy will raise $565,000 in one yeai and thai such levy will cost a man owning property of the value of $5,000, only one dollar, it would seem that there is n&lt;&gt; excuse for further procrastination. Attached to this report is a statement of the condition of the library and supreme court funds, a detailed statement of the receipt and disposition of supreme court reports^and an appendix showing the additions to the state library alphabetically arranged. Very respectfully, Librarian. H. C. LINDSAY, </seg>
