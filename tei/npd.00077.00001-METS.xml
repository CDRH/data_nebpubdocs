The Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, plaintiff ii, thi. case, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States. The writ was denied, and the case was dismissed and remanded. PUBLIC GRAIN WAREHOUSES The pub'ic grain warehouse law of 1931 was amended by tlie legis - lature of 1933 in several particulars. The termination of the license date was changed from December 31st to July 1st of each year, all bonds ex - piring contemporaneously with the license. Since the 1921 legislature adopted a provision exempting cooperative elevators from furnishing bonds, they have been granted a license on the filing of an application and paying the annual license fee. The 1933 amendment exempted co - operative companies, which stove grain for their members only, from all of the requirements of the public grain warehouse law, but if such com - panies wish to store grain under the law they may do so by furnishing bonds and complying with all of the oilier requirements. The registration of receipts by the Commission is a new provision in connection with the licensing of grain warehouses in Nebraska. The purpose of this provision is to permit the use of warehouse receipts as collateral security for loans. A fee for registration is imposed, which goes into the state treasury, and is there appropriated to the use of the grain warehouse department. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Since the 1933 law became effective receipts covering approximately eight million bushels of grain have been registered by the Commission, A considerable number of elevators had obtained licenses under the grain warehouse law for the year beginning January 1, 1933, but on ac - count of the change In the terminating date to July first, it was necessary to renew the bonds and licenses. While this was arranged by practically all of tbe licensed compauies, other companies were also attracted by the new provisions and secured licenses thereunder. Bonds filed and approved during the year 1933 amounted to a total of $5,683,600. Cover - age under insurance policies amounted to $379,500. These policies are accepted as additional security, if the warehouseman desires, when the value of grain in storage exceeds the amount of the original bond. If the insurance policies are not filed, additional bonds are required. During the year 1933, 29S inspections were made of elevators in various parts of the state, not including federally licensed elevators, and through the investigations thus instituted a number of elevators pro - cured licenses to store grain. A vigorous effort has been made urging owners of grain, who desire to place it in storage, to first ascertain if the elevator is bonded and licensed, in order that, their interests may be fully protected. When information comes to the Commission concerning the illegal storing of grain, an investigation is immediately started. If the report is found correct, the person transgressing the law Is informed he must either cease storing grain or furnish bond and obtain a license. If this is not done, prosecution under tlie provisions of tho grain warehouse law follows. STORAGE OF GRAIN ON FARMS During the 1933 session of the legislature, a law was passed in order "to provide the owner of grain in this state with means of warehousing same on farms under proper restrictions and safeguards, as a basis for credit and to aid in the orderly marketing thereof." Jurisdiction over this law was given the Railway Commission. The Commission in compliance with this Farm Storage law, adopted rules and prescribed forms putting the law In operation. Under the Farm Storage law federal corn loans were made to farmers and corn producers of Nebraska. Before the loans could be obtained, it was necessary for the corn to be inspected, and if found to meet the requirements of the federcl gov - ernment, the cribs containing the corn were sealed, if properly con - structed. In order to hasten the preliminary steps, the Commission ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p024">TWENTY SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT pointed 260 inspectors, residing in and familiar with the locality in which they worked. The Farm Storage act provides a minimum fee of *5 00 for the inspection of l.OCO bushels of corn, or less, and one-halr cent per bushel for the number of bushels to be inspected in excess of that amount. This money was paid into the state treasurv and was used fo - the expenses of the inspectors, the necessary supplies, and the wages of the office force which it was found necessary to appoint. While the federal government planned to have the period in which loans could be secured expire on March 1, 1934, from the outlook on December .1st it would appear as if it might be necessary to extend that period to a later date. During the six weeks in which applications wen filed, before the close of the year 1933, loan certificates were being issued at the rate of several hundred a day. and more interest was being shown as the farmers became accustomed to the government's t.-an Loans on corn were being made on the basis of 45c per bushel when lh,. inspector found it in condition to be stored properly. The federal government found the Commission always ready to co - operate with it in working out the details of the corn-loan plan and in bringing the loans to a successful conclusion. This department estin- ites that in excess of 40,000 such loans will be made to Nebraska citizen and that these loans will continue to be handled without delay </seg>

Nebraska State Railway Commission et al., Appellees. Appeal from the District Court of the United States fer the District of Nebraska. No. 9464— MAY TERM, A. D. 1933 Kennedy, Holland &amp; DeLacy, Attorneys for Appellant. Mr. Hugh LaMaster and Mr. Edwin Vail, Assistant At - torneys General, for Appellees. Before Stone, Van Valkenburg and Booth, Circuit Judges BOOTH, Circuit Judge: This is an appeal from a decree which dismissed a bill which sought to enjoin the enforcement of an order made by the Nebraska Slate Rail - way Commission. (Appeal taken from order in Resolution 85, 17 Neb St. Ry. Com. Rep. 532-543.) The Commission entered the order now in controversy on February 23, 1924. (See 17 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. pages 532-543.) On appeal by the railroad company to the supreme court of Ne - braska, that court affirmed the order of the Commission. (See 20 Neb St. Ry. Com. Rep., pages 534-537.) </seg>
            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION On writ of error to the supreme court of the United States, that court in November. 1928. dismissed the case. (See 21 Neb. St Ry Com R.. page 24; for mandate, see 22 Neb. St. Ry. Com. R. page 477.) In October, 1929, the bill in the present case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. That court after a trial, dismissed the bill on the ground that by reason of the litigation above mentioned, the matters involved had become res Judicata- and that there had been no substantial change in the situation. (See 24 Neb St. Ry. Com. Rep., pages 210-214.) The present appeal followed. IS THERE A JUSTICIABLE QUESTION INVOLVED The first matter which challenges our attention is the contention of appellees that the case presents no justiciable question. This conten - tion was apparently not made in the trial court. It is based upon the assumption that the plaintiff railroad company Is seeking the establish - ment of a new tariff and upon the postulate that in cases of this char - acter, administrative action is prerequisite to judicial action. Preliminary to a determination of this contention of appellees there should be a consideration of the question what body had jurisdiction to control the making or changing of a tariff applicable to the situation dis - closed. If, as appellees contend, the Nebraska State Railway Commission had such jurisdiction, then we think the present case does present a justiciable question; and for the following reason: The appellant Railroad Company applied to the Nebraska State Railway Commission for an amendment to the existing tariff which purported to be applicable to the situation. That Commission granted the amendment. Later on application of a shipper, the Commission revoked and cancelled its order amending the tariff. This cancellation order was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska and an appeal to the United States Supreme Court was dismissed. We think this procedure showed sufficient prior action by an ad - ministrative body, the Nebraska State Railway Commission. It is true that the Railroad Company, prior to the commencement of the present suit, might have made another application to said Com - mission; but we think that this would have been merely a futile ges - ture. Accordingly, our conclusion is that if the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission had jurisdiction over the subject matter, there is a justiciable question Involved in the present suit. Appellant contends that exclusive jurisdiction over rates and regu - lations touching the tracks involved is vested in the Interstate Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p126">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT -I . ■ . merce Commission; and appellant points to Section 3, paragraph 4, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, as supporting its contention. Appellant further contends that by the passage of the Transporta - tion Act of 1920, Congress entered the field of controlling the facilities in question; and that, absent regulations by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the control of such facilities rests with the Railroad Com - pany which owns the facilities. Appellant further contends that there was no occasion for it to re - sort to the Interstate Commerce Commission for administrative action before commencing the present suit, because the Railroad Company was not asking for any action by that body, but was simply seeking to exer - cise a common-law right belonging to the Railroad Company, and by the present suit was asking that defendants be enjoined from interfer - ing with the exercise of that right by the Railroad Company. These several contentions of the Railroad Company involve a num - ber of assumptions which we think cannot be taken as true without qualifications: The first assumption, relating to jurisdiction of the Interstate Com - merce Commission, is that Section 3, paragraph 4, of the Interstate Commerce Act contains the controlling provisions of the Act which have a bearing on the situation. We think that Section 1, paragraph 22, must also be considered. These paragraphs, so far as here material, are set forth in the margin. (They are: "Sec. 1. • • • * (22) The authority of the Commission con - ferred by paragraphs (18) to (21), both inclusive, shall not extend to the construction or abandonment of spur, industrial, team,', switching or side tracks, located or to be located wholly within; one state, or of street, suburban, or interurban electric railways, i which are not operated as a part or parts of a general steam rail - road system of transportation." "Sec. 3 * • • • (4) If the Commission finds it to be in the public interest and to be practicable, without substantially impair - ing the ability of a carrier owning or entitled to the enjoyment of terminal facilities to handle its own business, it shall have power to require the use of any such terminal facilities, including main-line track or tracks for a reasonable distance outside of such terminal, of any carrier, by another carrier or other carriers, on such terms and for such compensation as the carriers affected may agree upon, or, In the event of a failure to agree, as the Commis - sion may fix as just and reasonable for the use so required, to be ascertained on the principle controlling compensation in condemna - tion proceedings.") Read together, they show quite cleany that Congress intended that jurisdiction over the field of railroad services to the public should be in part under the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission and </seg>
            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION in part under the control of tbe States, each in its own sphere and by cooperative action. This view finds support in Board of R. R. Commis - sioners v. Great Northern Railway Co., 281 U. S. 412, 429. The second assumption, as to the necessity of administrative ac - tion, is that inaction by the Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 3, paragraph 4, necessarily means that the railroad is free from control in respect to the facilities in question. Such inaction, however, might mean that the Interstate Commerce Commission recognized that control over the matter could at the proper time be reasonably appor - tioned between federal and state authorities by cooperative action. The third assumption, also relating to the necessity of administrative action, is that in the case at bar the Railroad Company was simply asserting and trying to exercise a well-established, unqualified common - law right. As to this last assumption, see Grand Trunk Railway v. Michigan Railway Comm., 231 U. S. 457, and Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Ochs, 249 U. S. 416, as apparently casting doubt upon the right assert - ed being an unqualified one. Neither the second nor the third of these assumptions can, in our judgment, be taken as true without qualification and beyond dispute. Involved in tbeir consideration are questions of fact relating to railroad and economic policy, questions of fact relating to interference vel non of intrastate with interstate commerce, and questions of fact relating to the surrounding circumstances of the particular case at bar. All of these questions are, in our judgment, peculiarly for investiga - tion and determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission. We conclude, therefore, that if the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction of the subject matter, no justiciable question is pre - sented by the case at bar, because there has been no prior administra - tive action by the Interstate Commerce Commission. See as to practice, Transit Commission v. United States, opinion filed April 10, 1933 (USSC) ; Arkansas Railroad Comm. v. Chicago, etc. Railroad Co., 274 U. S. 597. JURISDICTION OF THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The question as now presented of the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission to regulate the use and charges therefor of the tracks in question was not raised by the Railroad Company until after the controversy was carried by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States and there disposed of by dismissal of the writ.

            <seg id="p128">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT j • ' . same conclusion that the State Railway Commission did have juris - diction. We are led to this conclusion: (1) by reading and comparison of Section 3, paragraph 4, and Section 1, paragraph 22, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended: (2) by the fact that the Interstate Com - merce Commission has taken no steps under said Section 3, paragraph 4, to regulate the use in intrastate commerce of the tracks in contro - versy, although said paragraph has been in existence since 1920, and during the said period the State Railway Commission has been exercis - ing jurisdiction in regard to the matter; and (3) by the reluctance of the courts to adjudge power in the Interstate Commerce Commission to enter the field of intrastate traffic and regulate tbe same in the absence of a hearing before that body, unless the bestowal of such power upon the Interstate Commerce Commission is made by clear language of the Statute, and unless the facts and circumstances clearly warrant the exercise of the power. Such, we think, has been the attitude of the Courts both before and since tbe passage of the Transportation Act of 1920. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Railway Company v. Railroad Commission of California, 283 U. S. 380; Western and Atlantic Railroad v. Georgia Public Service Commission, 267 U. S. 493; St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v.

S. 331, both decided prior to the passage of the Transportation Act; and see the recent case of Interstate Commerce Commission v. Oregon-Washington Railroad and Nav. Co., 288 TT.' S. 14, 40; (4) by a consideration of the relevant pro - visions ot the Constitution and Statutes of the State of Nebraska (Sec. 20, Article IV, Constitution of Nebraska; Section 75-201 et seq., and Sec - tion 75-712, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929). We do not wish to be misunderstood as holding that regulations or rates relative to intrastate business established by State authority may not interfere with interstate commerce to such an extent as to require exclusive control by the Interstate Commerce Commission; see Transit Commission v. United States, supra; but we think no such situation is presented by the case at bar. ARE THE ISSUES PRESENTED IN THE CASE AT BAR RES ADJUDICATA The trial court found as one of Its conclusions: "That the decision by the Supreme Court of Nebraska, in the case of Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation, Appellant, v. Ne - braska State Railway Commission, Appellee, 115 Nebr. 856, is res judicata upon the several matters and issues presented in this case." </seg>
            <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION We think this conclusion is right. (a) The issues presented before the Supreme Court of Nebraska were substantially identical with those presented to the trial court in the case at bar. The broad issue presented to the Supreme Court, of Nebraska is thus stated by that Court, quoting from the brief of the Railroad Com - pany's counsel in that case: "The question involved In this appeal is whether or not the order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission requiring the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska to open its team tracks on what is known as the 'Belt Line' ln the City of Omaha to the public should be upheld, or, in other words, whether the order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission should be sustained whereby the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska is required to switch, cars that have arrived in Omaha In the course of intrastate railroad transportation upon a railroad other than the Missouri Pacific to a team track owned by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, for a switching charge." The broad issue in the case at bar is disclosed by the prayer for relief in the bill of complaint reading as follows: "Wherefore' plaintiff prays that the said Nebraska State Rail - way Commission and the individual defendants herein and each and all of them, and the successors In office for each and all of them, be perpetually and permanently enjoined and restrained .n«-? enforcm e or attempting to enforce the order of February 23 1923, effective April 1, 1924, cancelling the said Freight Tariff Ne^ braska _No. 7 and from preventing or attempting to prevent the plaintiff company from denying to other railroads and shippers I thereover switching service from and to its team tracks in the City of Omaha and in the Omaha terminal, and from requiring or au - thorizing the use by other railroads of plaintiff's team tracks in or for a reasonable distance outside of the said Omaha terminal, and plaintiff prays for such other and further relief as may be Just and equitable." J j While the verbiage differs in stating the issue, the vital question is the same, viz., whether the order of February 23, 1924. of the Nebraska State Railway Commission was valid or invalid. , (b) That issue was decided on the merits by the Supreme Court of Nebraska. That court, after adverting to the evidence said (P. 140) : "Ordinarily, this court will not interfere with findings of tact of the State Railway Commission when it has jurisdiction and there is sufficient evidence before It to sustain its findings. a- ''? ev | rslbl e error does not appear in the record. It follows that the findings and order of the State Railway Commission must be, and they are hereby, approved." (c) The parties were substantially identical. The issue was raised </seg>
            <seg id="p130">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT and decided between the Nebraska State Railway Commission on the one side, and the Missouri Pacific Railroal Corporation in Nebraska on the other side. The fact that other parties were named in the State Court does not destroy the substantial identity of the parties. Thompson v. Roberts, 24 How. 233; Southern Cotton Oil Co. v. Shelton, 220 F. 247. The trial court's findings that there had been no substantial change of circumstances since the decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska is, we think, supported by the evidence. A discussion of the evidence we deem unnecessary. The judgment is affirmed. Van Valkenburgh, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result. Filed May 10, 1933. (65 Fed. Rep. (2nd) 5571 The appellant, Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, filed a petition for a w-rit of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in the above case. The Court denied the writ, and the case was dismissed and remanded. OPINIONS BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS STAFF In addition to participating in the Interstate Commerce Commission cases shown in Part I, the Attorney General's office furnished the Com - mission with the following opinions on general questions of law: Reference is made to your letter of January 31, 1933, File No. I. C. 8426, wherein you state: "The following complaint has been received by the Commission : " 'The "Shufflin* Sam" Show Co., which completed a local engagement Monday night at the Booth Theatre, inquired or Mr. Fred Gentry, our local MPT agent, as to a fare reduction for the 18 people in his Company from Nebraska City to Omaha. Mr. F. E. McDonald, MPT Supervisor at Kansas City, advised no reduction could be made. Upon receipt of this information the Shufflin' Sam people arranged with Watson Bros. Transfer Co., a local trucking concern, to motor them to Omaha. " 'Watson Bros. Transfer Co. are engaged in the transfer business, and this is the first instance, to the best of my knowl - edge, in which they engaged in passenger traffic. In my opinion, they were outside the law in carrying these 18 people in the van with the baggage, whether any fare was charged the people or not. </seg>

Is a moto. carriei°" compan r' and as 8 «eh is declared to be a common Section 60-102 provides that the Nebraska State Railwaj Commis - sion shall have general control of the common carriers mentioned in the preceding section, and vests said Commission with authority to make reasonable regulations, except the fixing of rates or fares to be charged governing each motor transportation company in the state, and also with authority to regulate the service and safety ol operation of each such motor transportation company. Section 60-103 provides fer the payment of registration fees. Section 60-104 provides for furnishing of a liability insurance policy or bond to be approved by the Commission, and Section 60-105 provides penalties fer the engaging in the operation of a motor vehicle as a com - mon earner, or of passengers fer hire, or for violating any of the pro - visions of the statute, or such orders as may be made by the Nebraska State Railway Commission pursuant to the act. The Nebraska State- Railway Commission, in pursuance to the power conferred upon them by statute, issued, under date January 30 1931 a plenary order providing numerous regulations designed for the safety of operation of motor transportation companies and for the protection or the public using such service. It will be observed that tho class of carriers defined by Section 60-101 as "common carriers" is somewhat broader than the generally accepted use of that term. Some authorities confine the proper use of the term "common carriers" to carriers of goods only, and generally speaking, common carriers of passengers are such carriers as hold them - selves out to the public for the purpose or transporting, generally and without discrimination, all persons who offer themselves fer transporta - tion at a prescribed rate or charge. It will be seen, therefore, that the act is broad enough to include private carriers who do not hold them - selves out tor the purpose of general public transportation but make special contracts for transportation between certain points </seg>
            <seg id="p132">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT The essential elements of the statute are (1) that the person or corporation be engaged in the business of carrying and transporting persons and baggage in motor propelled vehicles, (2) that such trans - portation be for hire, and (3) that it be over any public street, road or highway between fixed terminals in this state. The important question, therefore, is to determine whether or not the Watson Bros. Transfer Co. is engaged in the business of carrying and transporting of persons and baggage, for hire, between fixed ter - minals. It seems plain that the transaction in question was one "fer hire" and there is no controversy on this point. The next question presented is whether or not this company was engaged in the business of the transportation of persons and baggage It is to be observed that the statute says that "a person", etc., "when engaged in the business of carrying and transporting", etc., but we take this to be the equivalent of saying "any person", etc., "who shall be engaged in the business of carrying and transporting", etc. It was per - haps the intention of the legislature that no trucking line or any other association operating motor propelled vehicles should avoid liability as a carrier of passengers because of the fact that other business was done by them. Wherefore, this mode of expression was emploved by the legislature, instead of the equivalent we have suggested. However we do not deem the fact that the transfer company had other business! or that its principal business was of a different nature to be of con - trolling effect In this case. If and when it engaged in the carrying and transportation of persons and baggage, as defined in the statute, if such is the case, it then became a motor transportation company and is de - clared to be a common carrier by the statute. The next question presented, however, is this: The complaint in question shows only a single act or transaction. This act or transaction was, of course, the transportation of passengers and baggage, and if the transfer company was engaged in that business, it was, of course within the statute and amenable to the law and the rules of the Ne^ braska State Railway Commission. However, as a general rule, where engaging in any particular busi - ness is made a subject of statutory regulation and it is made imperative to procure a license or permit before engaging in such business, or the business itself is prohibited, or made illegal, it is generally held that an isolated act or transaction, standing by itself, will not constitute proof of the fact that there has been an engaging in the regulated or prohibited business. We quote from a number of cases: -.-♦"I? an appIIcation f «r We insurance, reciting that the appli - cant was not engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages, 'engaged' </seg>

" 'Engage or carry on business,' as used in Revenue Law, par. 105 declaring it unlawful for any person to engage in or carry on any business for which a license is required, without first obtaining and paying for such license, signifies that which occupies the time, attention, and labor of men for the purpose of a livelihood or profit, and it is not necessary that it should be the sole, exclusive business or occupation; and, while the doing of a single act pertaining to a particular business will not be considered as engaging in or car - rying on a business, yet a series of such acts would be so con - sidered."

"A contract whereby the owner of a lumber yard sold his lumber, stock, etc., to another person, and agreed 'that I will not engage in the lumber business directly or indirectly at said W./ etc., would include engaging his services to or in assisting a rival dealer in the same business, or soliciting and making sales, or influencing buyers who generally bought at that place; but it would not include mere isolated acts which do not tend to interfere with the other party's business, or occasional services voluntarily ren - dered for the convenience or accommodation of another in good faith, nor would it include subordinate employment not affecting the management or control of the business, or directly influencing custom."

Held, that the phrase 'who engages' means something more than occasional participation, and imports some continuity of practice, just as the word 'common' implies that a common gambler is a person who customarily, or habitually, or frequently carries on the gambling practices in violation of the statute as a money-making pursuit; and hence that the witness was not an accomplice whose testimony required corroboration."

Commonwealth v. White (Mass.) 157 N. E. 597. We think it is generally settled by these and other similar de - cisions that an isolated act or transaction will not, in itself, be consid - ered sufficient to evidence "engaging in business" under a regulatory or prohibitory statute. However, the mere act of carrying and transporting persons and baggage would not be the only matter ot evidence which it would be necessary to consider in a case of this kind. If the carrier has adver - tised or has solicited such business, has prepared facilities tor conduct - ing it, has expressed his purpose or determination to engage in that line of business, all of these matters would have evidential value and might be considered with the overt act of transportation for the purpose of showing that the carrier actually has embarked in the business in ques - tion. These facts do not appear from the complaint. Neither does it appear whether the transfer company operates between fixed terminals, as provided in Section 60-101. We suggest that, this opinion be transmitted to the complainant with tho request that further information be supplied as to the addi - tional facts which would be required to pass upon this matter. Should the information supplied be sufficient to show a violation either of the statute, or of the rules of the Railway Commission, the matter should, of course, be proceeded with as is customary with informal complaints. Referring to House Roll No. 240. a bill lor an act to fix maximum railroad rates lor intrastate carriage of wheat, and your request to this office for an opinion as to the constitutionality and effectiveness of said bill ir enacted into law, will say that, it is very probable that our Supreme Court would sustain the constitutionality of this law on the authority of State ex rci. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company v. Clarke, 98 Neb. 566, in which they held that the constitutional amendment creating the Ne - braska State Railway Commission did not grant to that body exclusive power to fix rates for the transportation of freight and passengers, but that it may fix such rates only in the absence of specific legislation. In that case, the legislature had assumed to pass the "Two-Cent Fare Act" which provided for a maximum charge by railroads for Intra- </seg>
            <seg id="p136">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT state passenger traffic of two cents per mile. It was held that this legislation was proper and did not infringe upon the grant ol powers bestowed upon the Railway Commission by the Constitution. Although the authority of the case is somewhat, impaired by the tact that it was decided by a divided court,— three of the judges dissenting, —it seems reasonably certain that it would be followed as a precedent. Assuming, however, that our court would follow the decision as in the Clarke case, there remains to be considered the effect of the Inter - state Commerce Act. Section 13 (3) provides for the procedure to be had in investigations involving any rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice made or imposed by the authorities of any state. Section 13 (4) provides as follows: "Whenever in any such investigation the commission, after full hearing, finds that any such rate, tare, charge, classification regulation, or practice causes any undue or unreasonable advan - tage, preference, or prejudice as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate or foreign commerce on the other hand, or any undue, unreasonable or un - just discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce which is forbidden and declared to be unlawful It shall prescribe the rate, fare, or charge, or the maximum or minimum, or maximum and minimum, thereafter to be charged, and the classification regulation, or practice thereafter to be observed, in such manner as, in its judgment, will remove such advantage, preference, preju - dice, or discrimination. Such rates, fares, charges, classificationa! regulations, and practices shall be observed while in effect by the carriers parties to such proceeding affected thereby, the law of any state or the decision or order or any state authority to th. contrary notwithstanding." "i It will be noted that by the last clause In said section, it is directed that the carriers shall observe the rates, fares, charges, classifications! regulations, and practices prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission, regardless of the law of any state to the contrary. It will thus; be observed that Congress has assumed such control of purely intrastate rates so far as may be necessary to prevent discrimination against inter - state traffic. The rationale of this assumed power was stated in Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 399, as follows: "The authority of Congress extends to every part of interstate commerce, and to every instrumentality or agency by which it is carried on; and the full control by Congress of the subjects com - mitted to Its regulation is not to be denied or thwarted by the commingling of interstate and intrastate operations. This is not to say that the nation may deal with the internal concerns of the State, as such, but that the execution by Congress of its constitu - tional power to regulate interstate commerce is not limited by the ' fact that intrastate transactions may have become so interwoven </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION therewith that the effective government of the former incidentally controls the latter. This conclusion necessarily results from the supremacy of the national power within its appointed sphere." In the case of Houston and Texas Railway v. United States, 234 U. S. 342, the initial headnotes of the case state as follows: "The object of the commerce clause was to prevent interstate trade from being destroyed or impeded by the rivalries of local governments; and it is the essence of the complete and paramount power confided to Congress to regulate interstate commerce that wherever it exists it dominates. "Wherever the interstate and intrastate transactions of car - riers are so related that the government of the one involves the control of the other, it is congress, and not the state, that is en - titled to prescribe the final and dominant rule; otherwise the na - tion would not be supreme within the national field. "While Congress does not possess authority to regulate the internal commerce of a state, as such, it does possess power to foster and protect interstate commerce, although in taking neces - sary measures so to do it may be necessary to control intrastate transactions of interstate carriers." In the opinion of the Court, delivered by Mr. Justice Hughes, it Is stated (p. 351) as follows: "Congress is empowered to regulate, — that is, to provide the law for the government of interstate commerce; to enact 'all ap - propriate legislation' for its 'protection and advancement' (The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 564); to adopt measures 'to promote its growth and insure its safety' (County of Mobile v. Kimball, supra) ; 'to foster, protect, control and restrain' (Second Employers' Liabil - ity Cases, Supra). Its authority, extending to these interstate carriers as instruments of interstate commerce, necessarily em - braces the right to control tlieir operations in all matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic that the con - trol is essential or appropriate to the security of the traffic, to the efficiency of the interstate service, and to the maintenance of conditions under which interstate commerce may be conducted upon fair terms and without molestation or hindrance. As it is competent for Congress to legislate to these ends, unquestionably it may seek their attainment by requiring that the agencies o' interstate commerce shall not be used in such mannei as to crip - ple, retard or destroy it. The fact that carriers are instruments of intrastate commerce, as well as of interstate commerce, does not derogate from the complete and paramount authority of Con - gress over the latter or preclude the Federal power from being exerted to prevent the intrastate operations of such carriers from being made a means of Injury to that which has been confided to Federal care. Wherever the interstate and intrastate transactions of carriers are so related that the government of the one involves the control of the other, it is Congress, and not the State, that is entitled to prescribe the final and dominant rule, for otherwise ' Congress would be denied the exercise ot its constitutional author - ity and the State, and not the Nation, would be supreme within the national field.

S. 563, the Court, in an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Tart, follows tho case above cited as Houston &amp; Texas Railway v. United States, which is referred to in the opinion ns the Shreveport Case, aud states (p. 58S) : "It is objected here, as it was in the Shreveport Case, that orders of the Commission which raise the intrastate rates to a level of the interstate structure violate the specific proviso of the original Interstate Commerce Act repeated in the amending acts, that the Commission is not to regulate traffic wholly within a State. To this, the same answer must be made as was made in the Shreveport Case (231 U. S. 342, 35S), that such orders as to intrastate traffic are merely incidental to the regulation of inter - state commerce and necessary to its efficiency. Effective control of the one must embrace some control over the other in view of the blending of both in actual operation. The same rails and the same cars carry both. The same men conduct them, Commerce is a unit and does not regard slate lines, and while, under ihe Constitution, interstate and intrastate commerce are ordinarily subject to regulation by different sovereignities, yet when they are so mingled together that the supreme authority, the Nation, cannot exercise complete effective control over interstate commerce with - out incidental regulation of intrastate commerce, such incidental' regulation is not an invasion of state authoritv or a violation of the proviso." Our conclusion in this matter is that although it is well within the power of the legislature to pass the legislation proposed in House Roll No. 240 and that the same is not unconstitutional, still the Interstate Commerce Commission would have tlie power to pass upon the rates established by this bill and to determine whether or not any discrimina - tion was created, or existed thereby, as against Interstate commerce. The decision, therefore, as to whether these rates should ever eventually take place would, in all probability, rest with the Interstate Commerce Commission.

The Northwestern Bell Telephone Company thereupon began the action to which reference is first above 'made, in which they sought to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the order entered by the Commission on November 4, 1922, and also sought to enjoin the defendants from interfering with the telephone company charging rates sufficient to yield it a return or S per cent per annum on the property used in such service. A preliminary injunction was al - lowed, the case was referred to a special master and alter an extended hearing a report was made by the special master to the Court, on which | the Court entered a decree under date ot March 4, 1925. The decree was entered pursuant to an opinion by Munger, D. J., which was reported in 6th Federal (2nd) 663, (18 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. 490-497). I- ■ , . ■ Judge Munger states in concluding his opinion: "It results, from what has been said, that a decree must be entered enjoining the enforcement of the order of the State Rail - way Commission. The plaintiff has asked that the decree also enjoin the defendants from interfering with the plaintiff's charging such rates for telephone service rendered by it in the state of Nebraska, as will produce to plaintiff a return or approximately eight per cent on the value or its properly used in rendering such service. The master has made a recommendation of a decree al - lowing the plaintiff to charge rates free from molestation by the </seg>
            <seg id="p140">TWENTY-SPXTH ANNUAL REPORT defendants, which will allow plaintiff a rate of return on its prop - erty of seven and one-half per cent. The making of rates is la legislative and not a judicial act. (Citing authorities.) A decree which should authorize the rates to be charged in the future would be clearly the exercise of legislative power and not a decision upon the validity of a rate which has been prescribed or adopted. The rates which are now in force are in force by acts of the plaintiff or by order or the State Railway Commission. Section 5520 or the Compiled Statutes or Nebraska (1922) provides as follows: (quoting statute). "The Court may not in the face of this statute, grant the right to the plaintiff to change its rates generally, in order that it may earn a fixed per cent upon its investment. Rates that are in force may not be changed, unless application has been made to the Commission for that purpose. Similar statutes have been held valid. (Citing authorities). If the hearing of such an application causes delay the plaintiff has a remedy against daily confiscation by seek - ing an injunction pending final decision by the Commission. But the effect ot the injunction to be granted in this case is to set aside the exchange rates fixed in the Commission's order or November 4, 1922; and therearter there will be no legal rates prescribed by the Commission in place of these exchange rates. Until the Commis - sion shall have adopted new rates, the plaintiff has the right to fix its own rates in place of the rates so enjoined, subject of course, to the general requirements of law that they be just and reason - able and not in violation of any statute. (Citing authority.) "The decree will not attempt in advance to determine a per - centage of return upon the investment which may be earned by the plaintiff, because such an order would fix the rates which might be charged by the plaintiff. The question or a proper rate of re - turn can be presented, when an actual rate of return has been es - tablished. A decree will be entered accordingly." It will be observed that the learned trial judge held that while a I decree must be entered enjoining the enforcement of the order of the i State Railway Commission under date of November 4, 1922, that he says that the effect of this injunction is to set aside the exchange rates fixed ! by that order, so that thereafter there will be no legal rates prescribed by the Commission in place of these exchange rates. He then points out that while the plaintiff has a right to fix its own rates in place of the rates so enjoined, subject to the general require - ment, of law, that they be just and reasonable and not in violation of any statute, still he refuses to enjoin Ihe defendants from interfering with the plaintiff's charging such rates for the future as will insure it a return of any specified percentage upon the value of its property used in rendering service. He states that a decree which will authorize the rates to be charged in the future would be clearly the exercise of legislative power and that the question of a proper rate of return can be presented when the actual rate of return has been established. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The decree entered in pursuance to this opinion enjoins the defend - ants or their successors, agents, etc: "First— from enforcing or attempting to enforce in any way directly or indirectly against the plaintiff that certain order of the State Railway Commission made and entered November 4. 1922, a copy whereof, marked Exhibit A is attached to the bill of complaint in this cause, in so tar as such order purports to fix the rates to be charged by plaintiff for ex - change telephone service in tho State of Nebraska: I "Second: From interfering, by the imposition of penalties or other - wise, with the charging by plaintiff of exchange telephone rates not approved or fixed by the State Railway Commission until such time as other or different rates for such service are prescribed or fixed by said Commission and become effective, and provided further that if the rates charged by the plaintiff by virtue hereof are excessive this decree may he modified or vacated as may seem just." The portion above quoted is the effective part of the decree which sets out the specific acts which are covered by the Court's injunction. There is a further provision in the latter part of the decree to the • ollowing effect: "Nothing herein shall be deemed to restrain the future exercise of the legislative power of said State Railway Commission and if circumstances so change as to make the exchange rates fixed by the order of November 5, 1922, reasonably compensatory, the defendants may apply to the Court for such further order as may then be just j jurisdiction of this cause being reserved for all proper purposes." It is of course a fundamental proposition that the making of rates by the State Railway Commission is a legislative function and not a judicial action. The injunction issued by the Court specifically enjoins the State Railway Commission from in any manner enforcing or attempting to enforce the order of November 4, 1922, so far as the same affects ex - change telephone rates in the State of Nebraska. The defendants are also enjoined from interfering with the charging by plaintiff of exchange telephone rates not approved or fixed by the State Railway Commission until such time as other or different rates for such service are prescribed or fixed by said Commission and be - come effective. This must be construed in the light of the opinion of Judge Munger. which we have quoted above, in which he states that the effect of this order is to wipe out the rates fixed by the order of November 4, 1922. and , to leave the plaintiff free to make its own rates. It will be noted that the injunction is only "until such time as other or different rates tor </seg>
            <seg id="p142">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT such service are prescribed or fixed by said Commission and become effective. There is a further proviso in this portion of the decree, to-wif Provided further that if the rates charged by the plaintiff by virtue hereof are excessive this decree may be modified or vacated as may seem just." The application of this portion or the decree would be this- The rates promulgated as ol November 4, 1922, are wiped out. The plaintiff 8 permitted to establish new rates, subject to the provisions as stated in the opinion, that they shall be just and reasonable and not contrary to any statute. If tho plaintiff should attempt to enforce unjust or un - reasonable rates, the plaintiff might, without resorting to legislative action, ask for a modification of the decree, or its vacation as might seem just. , This proviso is. however, in no way to affect the right of the Com- Mis_ion to prescribe other or different rates by legislative action. This is made more certain by the latter provision in the decree- "Nothing herein shall be deemed to restrain the future exercise of the legislative power of said Stale Railway Commission and if circumstances so change as to make the exchange rates fixed by the order of November 4 1922 reasonably compensatory, the defendants may apply to the Court fer such further order as may then bo just." This latter part of il,.. clause gives an additional right to apply fer modification of the decree in case it is desired to place the rates promulgated November 4. 1922. in effedt because of changed conditions. We conclude: First— That the injunction granted in the decree of March 4. 192;, i;i binding on the defendants only as to the order of November 4 192" and as to interfering with rates fixed by the plaintiff not approved by the State Railway Commission until such time as other or different rates have been prescribed or fixed for such service by said Commission. Second— That if the plaintiff fixes rates which are excessive the Commission may apply to the Court and have the decree modified or vacated, even without legislative action. Third— That if circumstances so change as to make the exchange rates fixed by the order of November 4, 1922. reasonably compensatory defendant may likewise apply to the Court for such order as may then be just. Fourth-That nothing in the decree should be deemed to restrain the future exercise of the legislative power of the State Railway Com- I mission and that they may after investigation in a new action, and ' after full notice and opportunity to the plaintiff, to be heard therein </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION regulate, prescribe and fix new rates fer the plaintiff which will be binding and effective upon the plaintiff when fixed and determined by the Commission. However, the tact that the wording or the decree is somewhat in - volved and requires explanation would indicate that the Commission, should, before instituting any proceedings, apply to the United States District Court tor a supplemental decree, declaring in express terms that the proposed proceedings are not affected by the injunction. This application would be in accord with the comity of relations which should subsist between all branches of government and even ir unnecessary would, be an act or courtesy which should be performed. ■ •'■■.■■■ . . . . ■ ■ ■ ■'. • • - . • Answering your letter of April 29, in which you ask for an opinion in the question of whether or not telephone companies are legally re - quired to furnish switching service to tarm line companies when they do not desire to do so, 1 beg to call attention to the case of Blackledge v. Fii'iiii'i's Independent Telephone Company. 105 Neb. 713, in which there &gt;vas presented a situation entirely similar to the one which is the sub - ject of your inquiry. In that case, the Farmers Independent Telephone Company and i tlie Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company were both engaged in the telephone business at Red Cloud, Nebraska. A physical connection had been maintained between the exchanges and the subscribers ot the Farmers company had been given long distance privileges for several years. Disagreements having arisen between the companies and the mat - ter having come before the Nebraska State Railway Commission, there was involved a petition in intervention, praying for an order to require the two companies mutually to exchange all telephone sen-ice, local as well as long distance. On hearing, the Railway Commissioner entered an order directing, among other things, that the two companies make necessary physical connection and each be required to receive and transmit all local calls, originating on the lines ot the other, where destined to a subscriber on its own local lines. On appeal to the Supreme Court, that body, through Flansburg, J., announced the law applicable to this situation as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p144">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT "Though at common law such public utilities could not be re - quired to make physical connection of their telephone systems, the legislature or the railway commission may order such connections when public convenience and necessity require, provided that the company required to render the service will receive proper com - pensation for tbe additional service which it renders, and that such conditions are imposed as will protect such company in its individual management and control of its own property, and that the order does not so operate as to create or allow of such dis - criminatory conditions as will cause Injury to the company con - cerned." Syllabus, Paragraph 3. For the reason that the Railway Commission had, in addition to tbe order in question, made other provisions as to the division ot business between the two companies which the Supreme Court was unwilling to approve, and because it considered that it might not legislate for tbe Commission but must approve or set aside the regulation as a whole, the order of the Railway Commission was annulled and set aside, but without prejudice to further proceedings before the Commission for the purpose of arriving at some reasonable regulation fer the exchange of service. j It is thus apparent that the Supreme Court has fully answered the inquiry in the case above referred to, and as the authority of that case has remained unchallenged since the decision was rendered on February 23, 1921, it is, and should be, binding upon the Commission. In Re: Reduction of Telephone Rates, Western Telephone Corpora - tion, Osmond, Nebraska, I. C. 8446. This is in response to the request of Mr. Commissioner Bollen for opinion as to the validity of the order entered by the Commission on the 2nd day of May, 1933, ordering certain reductions in telephone rates at the Osmond, Nebraska, exchange, to continue to January 1, 1934. It appears that a petition was received from subscribers, asking for a temporary reduction of rates, which was docketed as Informal Com - plaint 8446, of which notice was given to the respondent telephone com - pany by correspondence, which included a statement of the substance of the petition in question. Under date April 28, the respondent wrote a letter to the Railway Commission, acknowledging receipt of the corre - spondence and', referring to the contents of the petition, and also en - closing certain, data with regard to the operating revenue and expenses of the respondent at this exchange. The letter concludes: "With all these facts in mind, we shall leave it to your Honorable Body as to the disposition of the case." This letter of the respondent was filed as an answer. The "order of the Commission of date May 2, 1933, was pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION . dicated upon these informal pleadings, as well as upon an investigation made by the Commission on its own motion and the date submitted by the respondent with its answer. . It is contended by respondent that the Commission had no juris - diction to enter the order which was entered. In this we cannot concur. Assuming, but not conceding, that there is no statutory provision au - thorizing the fixing of the rates of a telephone company without a prece - dent hearing, and that there is no statutory provision authorizing emer - gency rates so far as a telephone company may be concerned, still the Constitution of the State of Nebraska (Section 20, Article IV) bestows upon the Commission the regulation of rates, service, and general con - trol of common carriers, under which classification is included the re - spondent telephone company. The State Railway Commission is not a court of inferior and limited jurisdiction but is an independent body, clothed not only with judicial, but with independent legislative and executive powers. It has been held by our Supreme Court that the Commission possesses all the powers bestowed upon it by the constitutional provision, except as the same may be limited by the legislature. In Re Lincoln Traction Company, 103 j Neb. 229; State v. Clark, 98 Neb. 566. As to the making and changing of telephone exchange rates, there is, and can be, no question but that the State Railway Commission has full and plenary power, and is endowed with jurisdiction of the subject matter as fully and completely as any court of record in the State of Nebraska is endowed with jurisdiction over matters cognizable in such court. Since there is full and complete jurisdiction of the subject matter, the only question that remains is to consider whether the Commission has. in the instant case, acquired jurisdiction of the person. It appears to us from the signed statement and declaration in the letter of the respondent, filed as an answer to the informal complaint, that the re - spondent submitted itself completely to the jurisdiction of the Commis - sion and waived any hearing to which it may have been entitled under the statute. Such hearing as is provided for by the statute is a provision for 'the benefit of the respondent and might be waived by it. An exact analogy is presented by a cause brought in a court of record, where the defendant enters its appearance and submits its case to the court, waiving trial. In such case, the court, having jurisdiction of the subject matter, obtains jurisdiction of the person by the appear - ance of the defendant, and the defendant's right to trial of the issues is waived. As to the question of the right of the Commission to provide a tem - porary or emergency rate, it is suggested by the respondent that there </seg>
            <seg id="p146">TWENTY-SEXTH ANNUAL REPORT is no statute conferring that right upon the Commission. In view of the broad constitutional powers bestowed upon the Commission, we think the Commission has that right, independent of any statute, and, as above suggested, whether the right was executed providently or improvidently by the Commission is a matter which was waived by the respondent" in its answer. Our conclusion is that the Commission had jurisdiction to enter the order which was entered on the 2nd day of May, 1933. and the same is a valid order. Answering your inquiry of May 16, asking whether the authorization ot the Commission must be obtained before securities are issued in a corporation engaged in the trucking business within the State of Ne - braska, will say: Section 75-1201, et seq., Compiled Statutes. 1929. provides for the regulation of issuance of stocks and bonds by common carriers and , or public service corpora; ions doing business in the State of Nebraska. This would be applicable to any common carrier engaged in intrastate business and would ihus fur include an intrastate common carrier trucker. 1 am of the opinion that this would not include a private or contract carrier. The term "public service corporation" is, we think! used to designate a class of private corporations, which lies inidway between common carriers and private contract carriers. . . "There is a large class ol private corporations which on ac - count or special franchises conferred on them owe a duty to the public which they may be compelled to perform. This class of corporation is known as 'public service corporations,' and in legal phraseology as quasi public corporations, or corporations affected with a public interest." State ex rel. Coco v. Riverside Irr. Co., 76 So. 216, 218, 142 La. 10. We ate assuming that the trucking concern will not hold out its services to the public on a definite schedule of rates as a common car - rier would, but will deal with the individuals with whom it may do business on a contract basis fer each transaction. Of course, if service is offered to Ihe public at a uniform rate, the company would be a com - mon carrier and its securities subject to regulation by the State Railway Commission. In our judgment, a private contract carrier, by truck, of goods and merchandise is not conducting a business so affecting the public interest as to make it possible for the public to compel the performance of the service which they have undertaken to perform, and hence not subject to regulation under the statutes above set forth. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Referring to Informal Complaint No. 8480, concerning which Mr. Chairman Randall has requested an opinion, will say that the letter of May 22, written by William B. Quigley of Valentine, Nebraska, sets out in substance the complaint that the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Company is threatening to cancel a lease to Thomas and Jones for a par - cel of land upon the railway right-of-way, which has been used for the purpose ot unloading and storing oil and gasoline. It is claimed that this cancellation will discriminate as against the said lessees because similar leases are being left in full force and effect. The question is asked as to whether the railway company may legally do this, or ir the same is forbidden by law. It this question were a matter of first impression, we would say that it would be within the power of the Railway Commission to com - pel the railway company to 'furnish storage facilities on the right-of-way to the complainants, since adequate space exists for such facilities, and they have been actually furnished in the past, and to discontinue them would create a situation prejudicial to the complainants. However, we jare confronted with this proposition: In the case of State ex rel. Board of Transportation v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 29 Neb. 550, two elevators were erected upon the right-of-way of the defendant, near Elmwood. and a farmers elevator company desired to erect another elevator. An order, authorizing the same to be done, was entered by the Board of Transportation and upheld by writ of mandamus issued out of the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska. However, the matter was carried to the Supreme Court of the United States, and that court, in the case of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company v. State of Nebraska, 164 U. S. 403, held ar, follows: "An order of the Nebraska State Board of Transportation, under the state statute of March 31, 1887. requiring a railroad com - pany to surrender a part of its land to private persons for the purpose of building and maintaining their elevator upon it, is a taking of private property of the company for the private use of such persons." "The taking by a state of the private property of one person or corporation, without the owner's consent, for the private use of another, is not due process of law, and is a violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States." It will be noted that in the Missouri Pacific case the structure in question was a permanent one, which would necessitate the surrender of the right-of-way of the railroad company to an individual for an in - definite length of time. The point is not exactly clear in the instant case, but we are assuming that unless a more or less permanent ar - rangement was effected by lease that the result would not be satisfac - tory to the complainants. We can, therefore, see no substantial differ - ence in the situations and are obliged to conclude that under the holding </seg>
            <seg id="p148">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT of the Federal Supreme Court, the railroad cannot be compelled to sur - render any portion of their right-of-way to private use, where such use would necessarily deprive them of the same for other purposes. We may not agree with the reasoning of this decision, but are bound to follow It as the expression of the highest court in the United States. Our conclusion on this proposition is that the Commission could do no more than tender its good offices for the purpose of effecting an amicable adjustment of differences between the parties. As to the matter presented in the letter of Mr. Quigley of date May 25, In which it is stated that it is proposed by the complainants, in case the railway company shall cancel the lease, to purchase a location con - tiguous to the right-of-way and a switch already in existence, and, if pos - sible, to require the company to stop cars on this sidetrack so that they may be loaded and unloaded from the location purchased by complain - ants :- While this is as yet a moot question, it would seem to us that if the question should arise, relief could be given under Section 74-501 of the Compiled Statutes, 1929, which provides for equal facilities being afforded shippers. This section provides, amongst other things, for reasonable and equal terms, service, facilities, and accomodations to all persons and associations who are engaged, or desire to engage, in the operation of grain elevators, or any other industry, or in the handling or shipping of merchandise, produce, commodities, or other property at, near or contiguous to any railroad or any station of its roads; and further pro - vides that the railway company may be required, if necessary, to con - struct, equip, and maintain a branch sidetrack of suitable length and grade within four feet of the outer edge of its right-of-way and adjacent to and opposite the proposed industry. It is probable that as a private right, rather than the rights of the public generally are concerned, that action should be taken in the courts rather than before the Commission. Loup Val. Land Co. v. U. P. R. R. Co., 95 Neb. 331. However, this can be determined when the question arises. Re: Resolution No. 129— In the Matter of a Reduction of the Tele - phone Rates for Rural and Switched Subscribers of the Central Nebraska Telephone Company In Nebraska. You huve submitted a proposed order in the above 1 matter and asked for our opinion as to the principles of law which should govern. There are, of course, two major factors which enter into the mak - ing of utility rates. We refer to the elements of cost of service and value of service to the consumer. </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION We do not find that the relative weight to be given to these factors has been settled by court decisions to the extent that hard and fast rules may be laid down which will govern all situations. In normal times the question presented in testing telephone rates for reasonableness is this: What is the amount of money prudently in - vested, or the value of the property used and useful, — if that basis is adopted, — and what is a fair rate of return upon the same, considered with reference to what would be a fair price for subscribers to pay for their telephones? 3 Spurr "Guiding Principles of Public Service Regulation", 528-537, 51 C. J. 23-24. In times of financial distress, the earnings of the company may be depleted so that the question of the company's right to earn a dividend may become involved. In such cases the courts have held that the rights of the public are entitled to prior consideration over those of the stockholders, and that the public may not be charged rates which are more than the value of the service rendered, for the purpose of affording dividends to the stockholders. Pond, Public Utilities, Sec. 549-550; Covington &amp; Lexington Turnpike Road Co. v. Sandford, 164 U. S. 578; 3 Spurr Guiding Principles, 533-534. It has also been suggested that in normal times utilities should be permitted to earn more than a bare return, so that they may accumulate a surplus for contingencies. Re Lockport Light, Heat &amp; Power Co. (N. Y. Pub. Ser. Com.) P. U. R. 1918 E. 675. A corollary to this proposition would be that where such surplus has been accumulated it would be only fair to require the utility to draw upon the surplus rather than to permit rates in excess ot tbe value of service to be exacted from the public. So far we go clear, but when we approach a situation such as tbat reflected in the findings in this case we are leaving the charted sea and venturing into unknown waters. It appears that if the respondent telephone company has not suf - fered an actual operating deficit, in the past year, it has come very close to that point It has lost a large number of its rural subscribers, and while the cause may not be fully reflected in the record it is within the knowledge of all of us that the reason for this is undoubtedly the de - pressed conditions of agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT The question is what course the Commission may lawfully take under these circumstances, with respect to the rural rates now prescribed by the respondent. May it lower these rates by finding them to be un - reasonable in excess of the rates that are prescribed by this order. There are two views which may be entertained. The one view would be that the Commission should not assume Ihe management of the respondent, nor attempt to provide it with sufficient operating revenue, but should leave it to work out its own salvation! On the other hand, there is another school of thought which takes the view that where a utility is in danger of impending dissolution through deficits in operating revenue, it is the duty of the regulatory coinmission, in the interest of the general public and of the investors in that utility, to take such steps in the regulation of its rates as will place the utility on a sound basis. Quoting from 3 Spurr's Guiding Principles, 535-6: "* * * the Oregon Commission has said: 'Normally, a public utility is entitled to sufficient revenue from its operations to fullj meet its necessary production and distribution expenses, and to provide a lair and reasonable return on the fair value of the prop erty. But there arc certain other correlated bases which must be given due weight. The first and most important of these is the value of the service to the consumer, in order that we may avoid the imposition of prohibitive rates which in themselves by loss of business might defeat the purpose of increased revenue sought by the higher rates. More important than a profit on the investment is the preservation or the integrity or the capital investment itself, and this phase of the subject deserves the Commission's first con - sideration, in order that the community may be assured of unin - terrupted electric service.' " Quoting again from Mr. Spurr (P. 529): "In a Wisconsin case it was said: 'Ordinarily, the rate of re - turn or the rates for services that are reasonable to the utility are also reasonable to the consumers. When consumers secure these services at rates that only cover operating expenses, [including de - preciation and a fair rate of return on the investment, they are obtaining the service at as low a rate as, under normal conditions, they can reasonably expect. But there may be exceptions to this. There may be utilities which are operating under such conditions that no rates that can be collected from the consumers would be sufficient to meet the above named charges. In fact, such utilities are met with more frequently than might be expected. This un - fortunate situation may be due to lack of sufficient number of customers, to mistakes in construction and excessive cost of the same, and to many other causes. Such utilities, in order to be paying concerns, would require higher rates fer their services than their customers are willing to pay rather than ferego these ser - vices, and the collection or such rates is, of course, out of the ques - tion. Utilities of which this is true cannot be subject to any </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION general rules. They can be dealt with only in the light of the J conditions which surround them.' " It could not, of course, be asserted as a matter of law, firmly set - tled and established by court decisions, that this Commission has the unquestioned right under the circumstances reflected in the findings to pursue the exact course outlined in the order, nor can we prophesy ac - curately what the decision of the courts would be in such instance. We will say, however, that the policy of permitting the Commission to take such regulatory stops with regard to rates as may be necessary in the interest or the general public and lor the preservance of the capital structure or the utility appeals to us as more reasonable than the op - posing 'hands oft" doctrine, and we believe that it is, in principle, the more salutary. Assuming that the Commission sees fit to fellow this doctrine, the question then remains as to the propriety of its action in requiring a reduction or rates and the reasonableness of the amount of the reduc - tion required. This brings up the problem of whether the proposed steps will have the effect desired— for, or course, not only must the lapsed subscribers be brought, back hut new business must be procured, ir the operating deficit is to be overcome. The order must be trankly experimental for there is no evidence in the record to show how much new business will be attracted— nor do v.e believe such matter susceptible of proof. In this connection, however, it should be considered that the order is only temporary and the experiment is therefore rendered less haz - ardous. While there is no express provision in the statutes authorizing emergency rates as to telephones, we think that the installation of such rates is within the constitutional powers of the Commission. The con - stitutional powers bestowed upon the Commission with respect to the regulations of rates of all common carriers, including telephone com - panies, are very broad. While they have not been defined by statute as to telephone companies, neither have they been limited or circumscribed. The constitutional powers as to regulation of the rates of railroads and telephones are the same. There is, it is true, an express statutory provision providing for emergency railroad rates, but this statute is, as we view it, but a more specific definition of one phase of the general power to regulate rates which is bestowed by the constitution. On this phase of the case the problem of the Commission, in our </seg>
