            <seg id="p005">BIKNNIAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. To Governor Ashton C. Shallenberger The Normal schools of Nebraska have taken a very long stride orward during the two years of your administration. New Legislation. The Legislature of 1909 passed a number of bills affecting mater lly the Normal school work of this commonwealth IIOI'SK KOLI NO. 28{ This bill carrying an emergency clause was signed April 1, 1909 It created a new Board to be known as the "Normal Board of Educa- ion" to supersede the "Board of Education," that for forty years hail controlled and managed the Normal school work of the State. Im - mediately upon their appointment and confirmation by the Senate they issumed control of the Normal schools of the State. Because of the conflict of this law, with some of the sections of the old law that were not amended or repealed, and because of the including of more than natter in the law, the Auditor and Treasurer were in doubt iif n regard to recognizing the Board. The Attorney General was asked or an opinion. His opinion led to the bringing of an action to de- ■rmine the constitutionality of this law. The suit was carried through lr Supreme Court and on November 15, 1909, the decision of our Supreme Court made it clear that it was not and never had been a Normal Board of Education." This act beins? void, the Board of Edu - cation continued to manage the affairs of the Normal schools. HOUSE ROLL NO. 232 This act provided for the locating of an additional Normal school in the north-western part of the State. While the suit was pending testing House Roll No. 286 neither Board took any action in carrying out the provisions of this law, except to receive and file the applica - tions from the several towns interested. As soon as the legality of the Board was determined, acting upon the advice of the Attorney General, the Board proceeded promptly in carrying out all of the instructions and provisions of the law. The following filed applications: Ainsworth, Alliance, Chadron, Crawford, Gordon, and Rushville. These places hav - ing complied with the requirements of the law, the Board visited them to inspect the sites offered, beginning January 3, 1910, at Alliance, and ending the trip at Ainsworth.

            <seg id="p008">8 BIENNIAL REPORT A. F. &amp; A. M., July 27, 1910. The building will be completed soon after the new year. For the first time in its history we will be able to prop - erly house the administration forces of this school. Just now they are crowded into cloak rooms in another building. In addition to the office rooms which occupy ;i part of one floor, we gain several needed school or class rooms. NEW BUILDINGS. Chadron is asking this year for a heating plant and sufficient re - pair fund to rearrange the old academy building into a dormitory for the girls. If the growth at Chadron is to be in like proportion to Kear - ney and Wayne, as new normals, then we ought at this time to have an appropriation for one of the wings to the main building, for the present building would not accommodate one-half of the students. Kearney asks this year for funds to build and complete the south wing of their building. They need it to keep pace with the growth of the school. The several departments that will occupy the south wing are today crowded in small rooms and in fenced off parts of the main corridors. These small rooms and large classes greatly hinders efficient work. Peru is not asking for any new buildings this biennium, but do as for the appropriation that was cut out of House Roll No. lsy by tt last Legislature, $\2,i»'&lt;&gt; for an additional story to the now overcrowd* library building. Wayne asks for a in w building suitable lor a library ar hall. This is greatly needed. The enrollment is passing the most sa guine expectations. Before th« first two years of her history is pass&lt; the present buildings will be crowded to oversowing. At present v have no place for the splendid and rapidly growing library. OUR LIBRARIES That was a very wise provision that the legislature made in creat - ing the Normal schools for Nebraska that all the matriculation fees — the $5 from each student when they first matriculate — should be used only for library purposes. It is surprising how fast the library grows under this provision. It gives to all our Normal schools, without a dol- hool lar taxation, fine working librari OUR ADVANCEMENT All rules are broken when you come to apply them to the growth of our Nebraska Normal Schools. We can simply say "larger and still larger each biennium." The unprecedented increase keeps up. Not - withstanding all of this increase in attendance, which means correspond - ing increase in expenses, for it means more equipment and greater re - quirements, we come down to the close of this biennium within the ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p009">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 9 propriations with just one exception, the salaries at Peru. The de- ficiency in salaries at Peru is caused by the fact that the Legislature did not appropriate enough to meet the actual payroll then in force The increased attendance would not allow any dropping out of faculty The maintenance will hardly pull through without a deficiency. ThiaWM caused by very freely spending tin- money in this fund while the case wa landing in the supreme court. A little holding in then would have avoid 1 any deficiency. President Haves is trying hard to close the l&gt;iennium without a deficiency herf CHANGES IN THE FACULTY The Board, for good and suffic ent reasons, was compelled to make a change in the head of the school at Peru. President Crabtree re- tired May 31, 1910, and Superintendent I). W. Hayes assumed charge of the school as president June 1, 1910. The school has not suffered in the least, for the enrollment is the largest now of its entire history. Death has entered our ranks twice in this biennium, taking two ex- cellent teachers, Miss Sydney Murphy from Peru and Prof. ( Murch from Kearney. We have lost some other exc&lt; been able to pay as large salaries command. We were compelled to llent teachers because we have not as we should for the talent at our let these teachers go because other schools and other states could pay them larger salaries than \*e were pay m Your administration, Governor, marks a great stride forward in Normal school work in Nebraska. This advance should continue. The laws of our State makes the Normal schools the center ol' the system that reaches the elementary schools and now no backward step should be taken. Our Normal schools are ready to assume the responsibility that the law puts upon them. These great educational centers should ncouragement in their work for they are furnishing to ref this State a large number of carefully trained and well educated teachers. Upon the efficiency of our teachers depends much of the advancement of Nebraska Normal education is always a matter in which the people of this ive taken a lively interest. It has never attracted more atten tion and shown better results than during this biennium. Our Normal hools are abreast of the times in which we live and they equip the teacher for every new line of activity that seems so vital to the best development of the citizens of tomorrow. There has been a sweeping change in pedagogical standards. This change has put new resonsi- bilities upon our Normal schools. We have met these new conditions. in fact we were the forerunners, we lead and others followed. We did not forsake the old "three R's" nor did we chase off after ■"new- fads" but along with the old position in educational work, we moved </seg>

It has takf tional world a good while to learn, that the foundation for or vocational education is not up in the Universities tutions of learning but the real foundation is in the elem grade schools. The grasping of that thought has created ;t w demand for men and women especially trained along it lines. To meet this demand our Normal schools moved c i. front rank years ago, we have made it a strong feature, thf jrof sional training of teachers to put them in thorough touch with every phase of industrial education. The Board has insisted and our Nor schools have faithfully carried out the plan putting special str domestic science, domestic art, manual training and agriculture.

The Board owns files sufficient to keep the papers of a current biennium. In addition then the secretary has to furnish a store room for the files of the past forty years. The records now on file in the secretary's office go back to Peru, Nov. 11, IXtiu. And these old records have been frequently consulted during this biennium. The Board of Public Lands and Buildings could not furnish suitable rooms for they did not have a vacant room at their disposal in the State House. When the Auditor refused to draw warrants for the office expenses which included the secretary's allowance, postage, express, etc., the At - torney General was asked for an opinion touching the legality of the claim. In a carefully written opinion he decided that it was a just claim and should be paid. The Auditor still refused to pay these claims and the Board then appointed the following as ■ committee to whom they referred the entire matter and with power to act: Mr. Brian, Mr. McDonald and Mr. Childs. After a conference with the Attorney General the committee employed Mr. T. J. Doyle to begin mandamus proceedings in the District Court of Lancaster County. After a two days hearing the court granted the writ asked for. Acting upon your advice, Governor, the case has been appealed to the Supreme Court and is now set for a hearing Jan. 3, 1911. July o, l'Jlo, after several months delay, and a further conference with the Attorney Gen - eral, the Auditor decided to allow the claims for postage, express, etc. The term of the present secretary will expire shortly and the Board will be compelled to find new office and store rooms. The Board of Public Lands and Buildings have recently assigned the use of the southwest basement rooms in the State House to the Board of Educa - tion. The room will have to be plastered, floored and fitted for use. This, with the plastering of the corridor as far as the basement stairs, will cost, it is estimated, $1,000. The work of the Board has increased greatly. Four normals with students we count by the thousands, with appropriations that go beyond the half million, together with thous - ands of letters annually, all mean a large amount of clerical work. Surely they ought to have a place to meet and where this work can be properly done. Four normals also mean a greatly increased expense account i they visit each Normal at least one a year. It also means a consider able increase in the other expenses of the Board. The Board asks for this biennium For expense of the Board fund i For furniture, office equipment, etc </seg>

On November 11, 1865, a meeting of the citizens of Peru was held pursuant to a call at which Dr. J. F. Neal was elect - ed President and Fred Ally Secretary. Resolutions were passed in favor of establishing a "high grade" school and erection of suitable buildings, and said school to be under the management and care of the M. E. church. Rev. Hiram Burch and Wm. Daily were appointed a committee to solicit funds On Dec. 3rd nine trustees were elected, and on the 5th Wm. Daily was elected president, and Daniel C. Cole, Secretary. On Febr. 12th, 1866, the Legislature granted a charter for the Peru Seminary and College. The finance committee succeeded in raising about 110,040, and on the 30th day of March 1866, the corner stone of the first building was laid. Negotiations were entered into by Mr. Burch in behalf or himself, John F. Neal, Maj. Daily, and Prof. J. M. McKen - sie with Robert W.

Neal's Addition was laid out on a part of the NE' 4 , North of the above 60 acres. Mr. Burch secured the services of J. M. Haacker to survey the Neal Addition in 1866, and assisted as a handy-man in the work. This tract lay south of Peru and was covered with an undergrowth of hazel brush. Mr. Haaker used a transit instru - ment and a two-pole surveyor's chain. The corners of the blocks and lots were witnessed by split oak stakes. The site of Peru was surveyed out of the SEV4 of section 16, the south tier of blocks terminating on the line between sections 16 and 21 which lacked about 36 feet of being full width and when the Neal Addition was surveyed, the north boundary being the above section line, a strip :?tj feet wide off the north side thereof was added to the said tier of fractional </seg>

It is well proven that Rev. Burch soon after the Neal Ad - dition was surveyed and while the stakes were still standing, planted an osage orange hedge along the south line of his block No. 196. The stumps of this hedge I readily found and measured therefrom north to the north edge of the retaining wall on the n&lt;5rth side of the block and found the distance to be 292 feet or 4 feet excess, so it would appear that there is also an excess in the width of the blocks in Neal's Addition.

The ground has been all spaded over in a previous search for the corner which by some accident is claimed to be lost. I am informed by Charles Neal, owner of the SW^4 of sec. 21, that about 1886 he was present when the County Sur - veyor found the center of section 21, and set a stone in place of the stake, and that the point was in the bottom of a gulch or ravine near its head, and that a fence post was set about 2 feet west of it and a fence built from there on west to the large ravine about 12 rods west. Dr. J. F. Neal, one of the donators of land to the old Seminary campus, and is owner of lands in the SE14 of sec. 21, stated to me that the corner stood in a gulch and 18 rods west of the west boundary of the county road, and on line with the north line of Tynon's fence and barn, and pointed out the location about 3 feet east of the corner fence post referred to by Charles Neal. Prof. H. B. Duncanson stated that he lived in the house oc - cupied by Mrs. Wm. Tvnon about 24 years ago and pointed out the location of the corner in the ravine and east of the same corner fence post. Mr. Jacob Good, owner of the north part of the Mrs. Mc- Kenzie tract, stated that all measurements of adjoining lots were from the corner fence post. On the north side of an old fence running west from The corner of the fence post there is a row of large osage orange trees and stumps extending nearly to the large ravine 12 rods west, some of which are 12 inches in diameter.

The foregoing investigations prove that neither stone found located at the legal center of section 21. I therefore con- clude to adjourn the survey sine die, to obtain information April 8, 1910. On my return to Lincoln I visited Rev. Hiram Burch here - tofore mentioned who was very instrumental in founding the Seminary and assisted in the survey of the Neal Addition, and from whom I learned many particulars regarding the survey which I regarded as closely associated with a survey of the campus. Although more than 80 years of age Mr. Burch's mind was very clear and active, and he very readily recalled many of the incidents and facts connected with the founding of the Seminary. He said he hired Mr. Haaker to make the survey and as - sisted wherever he could as a handyman; that the hills were covered with low hazel brush and an occasional tree so that the lines had to be cut away; that the timber used to monu - ment the corners of the lots and blocks were split oak stakes about 1% to 2 inches square x 2 ft. long; that a two pole chain was used made of about Xo. 8 or 9 wire and the links were not brazed; that he did not assist in the chaining; that Mr. Haaker used a transit instrument. He could not recall a circumstance associated with a survey of boundary lines of the Seminary grounds. He said the center of the section was in the bottom of a little gulch on line with the north boundary of Mr. Tynon's lot and that Prof. McKenzie planted a row of osage orange trees on the line east of the corner and west to the large ravine. Also that he planted a row on the north side of his grounds, adjoining the seminary grounds on the south. I also addressed two letters to Prof. J. M. McKenzie the first principal of the Seminary and of the Normal School, who was one of the donators of land to the Seminary, requesting in formation as to his recollection of location of the Normal grounds, and of certain corners. The substance of his replies bearing directly upon the subject is, to-wit: That he did not </seg>

Prof. J. W. Prabtree, principal of the School, informed me that wh«»T&gt; a student he built the fence along the supposed south line of the grounds running east from the county road. I also interviewed Mr. D. C. Cole, one of the survivin trustees of the "Seminary and College," and other old settler whom I met. All of the foregoing statements made by Dr. J. F. Neal, Rev. Hiram Burch, Prof. J. M. McKenzie, donators of land to the Seminary, David Good, Charles Neal, old settlers and own - ers of land effected by the survey, Prof. Duncanson, and Prof. Crabtree, will have a direct bearing corroborative of evidences found in further investigations. Further Investigations of the Campus or Normal Grounds. I return to Peru on the evening of June 14th, 1910, to con tinue my investigations and resurvey of the Normal grounds. June 15, 1910 I go to the location of the center of sec. 21, and uncover the south stone found in April, and with a brush remove the soil from all its interstices and find on the edge or end op - posite its base a notch about % of an inch wide by % of an inch deep cut with a blunt tool. </seg>

Be - low the old grass roots, I find the mark of a deposit of differ - ent composition 15 ins. long E and W x 4 ins. wide. The stone as stated in the notes was 14 ins. long, 15 ins. wide and 4'j ins. thick. About a foot south I find another similar mark immediately on the N side of the wagon track, with small chippings of white stone around the same but mostly on the south side and in the wagon track down the slope. Mr. Palmer said the wagon wheels rubbed against the south side of the stone. I conclude that the first mark found is the original location of the stone as the sediment in the hole is more compact than in the second mark, and the chippings from the stone shows the south mark to be where it was re-set. In place of the original mark or location of the stone I dig a hole 10 x 10 ins. x 12 ins. deep, and set a limestone 15x8x9 ins. marked on upper end thus </seg>

The point falls on the east slope of steep bluff on west side of same ravine. I clear off the surface of the bluff for a distance of several feet around the temporary corner but do not find any indications of a corner. From my temporary corner at the N. W. corner of the tract I run the meanders of -the west boundary according to the notes of said line as given in the deed of Aug. 10, 1867, and closed 7 1 -. links or 5 ft. south and 57 Iks. or 37.6 ft. East of the temporary S. W. corner of the tract. A computation of the latitude and departures of the above courses gives a clos - ing of 54 links East and 8 links South of the temporary cor - ner which shows that an error had been made in some of the angles or an accumulative error in all the angles. The south boundary is 5.35 chs. and is the north boundary of a tract conveyed by the Trustees of the Seminary and Col - lege to Charlotte B. McKenzie, Aug. 3, 1867. The North boun - dary is a full number of rods or chains and includes the val - ley of the ravine. I conclude that the error is in reading the angles. Therefore to connect the N. W. and S. W. corners of the tract, I calculate a correction to be added to the courses, to-wit : My falling was 57 links East of the S.

The opportunities for training have heretofore been very limited. The nearest state institu- )re than 350 miles by rail from Chadron, and more liles from Alliance. As a result of the great distance from ry few of the teachers have had school opportunities aside from the junior normal which has been maintained now for some ten years at Alliance The needs of the school cannot be fully measured at this time. The Chadron Academy building, acquired by the state when locating the school at Chadron, can be converted into a most excellent dormitory which will house perhaps forty young people. This change will require the expenditure of approximately $5,000. The new building will arcom bout 150.

JOSEPH SPARKS. President KEARNEY Kearney, Nebraska, December 1, 1910 To the Honorable State Board of Education: I am pleased to submit herewith a report of the progress and con - dition of the State Normal School at Kearney, with a detailed account of receipts and expenditures for the biennium now closing. Matriculation and Enrollment On July 29, 1910, the Kearney Normal closed its fifth year. Up to that time 3,000 students matriculated, no student's name occurring in the list more than once. This is an average of 600 matriculations each year. The enrollment to the date above mentioned averaged 1,035 each year. This is a remarkable record for a new school and gives it rank in attendance with the older schools of the country. We have graduated from our higher course 265 students; have is - sued 139 life certificates and 315 of the elementary grade. Fourteen students are graduated from the Department of Commerce, representing a five-years course beyond the eighth grade. Faculty and Employees The president of the school does not take unto himself the credit for its rapid and substantial development, but gives full recognition to the splendid men and women who are his co-workers, and points with pride to the fact that eighteen of these who took up their work in the institution when it was established five years ago are still connected </seg>
            <seg id="p053">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 53 with the school. Gathered from all parts of the state and from every department of public education, the faculty of the Kearney Normal pre - sents a wide experience, sound education and a broad insight into the needs of our public school system. Practically all hold degrees from in - stitutions of higher education. These people have stood loyally to - gether, have worked under many difficulties and have subordinated their own interests in a large measure to the building of the school. Much credit is due to them. Equipment. Much care has been exercised upon the part of the management in he expenditure of funds appropriated for equipment. Every dollar has reached the limit of its purchasing power, and although we have not had large sums of money, the institution is finely equipped. The mem - bers of the faculty have taken great care of the materials and apparatus purchased, and all equipment is as good as when installed. Domestic Science In September, 1909, a Domestic Science Department was installed. There being no room in the building, a small cottage near the building was rented at $16.00 per month. This cottage was equipped ior the work of this department. It became necessary, however, to give up this cottage at the beginning of the present year, and no other suitable building could be secured. It became necessary to abandon the de - partment, already well under way and doing splendid service, or to construct a cottage of our own. The latter plan seemed the wiser, and at a cost of $500.00, a domestic science cottage was built. This cottage contains a kitchen and laboratory, a serving room, pantry and reception hall. It is fully equipped and is accommodating at the pres - ent time 70 students. Under the direction of Mrs. Brindley, Preceptress, and Miss Marion Williams, head of Domestic Science Department, the young ladies who wait tables in the dining room at the dormitory are organized into a class and are given effective instruction in preparing the table, serv- ing, the care of dishes, silverware, etc. They have regular recitations and are graded on the work actually done in serving. Credit is now given for this work. The plan not only gives better quality to the din- ing room service, but elevates the work of the waitresses to the dig- nity of a class recitation. Manual Training. The Department of Manual Training was established at the open- ing of the school. Our present quarters do not permit of expansion, but Professor Mercer has at the present time 44 pupils doing bench work. We are using the Beardsley System furnished by the American Manual Training Corporation. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">BIENNIAL REPORT 54 Pottery. This is a new department, but thus far it is more than satisfactory. During the summer session of the present year much fine work was done and great interest shown on the part of the students. This work, in connection with the Art Department, is coming rapidly into favor. So far as we know, this is the only school in the state paying special attention to this phase of industrial education. Agriculture. We asked two years ago that the legislature provide for stronger work in this department. Professor Mercer has had charge of Geog - raphy, Manual Training and Agriculture. This places too much work upon his department without assistance. The legislature failed to pro - vide sufficient funds to employ a teacher to relieve Professor Mercer. We are asking the legislature this year to provide sufficient appropria - tion to extend the work of this department and to make it more effec- Physical Education. The Board of Education recently established a Department of Physical Education and called Professor Geo. J. Van Buren to the de - partment for men. Mr. Van Buren has special preparation and special fitness for the important work to which he is called. Mrs. Grace E. Steadman has charge of the physical education for girls. While we are able to do something for this very important phase of education, we shall not be able to bring it up to its highest degree of proficiency until we are provided with a more suitable gymnasium. Steps may be taken soon to provide temporary relief and to tide us over until such time as the legislature may make proper provision. The North Wing. The last session of the Nebraska legislature appropriated for the north addition to the main building. The contract was let to Mr. W. F. Crossley of Kearney, who has the building well under way. The building is entirely of fireproof construction and will be ready for occupancy by the 9th of January, when the school opens after Christ - mas vacation. This building has long been needed and will, furnish some relief from the over-taxed condition of the main building. It will also provide an opportunity lor the departments assigned to it to de - velop. The new building will accommodate on the first floor the library; the second floor will be devoted to Music, Art and the Languages; Agriculture and Biology will be assigned to the third floor Salaries. The salaries paid by the Kearney Normal are much below the sal - aries paid by similar institutions throughout the country. We have </seg>
            <seg id="p055">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 55 een very fortunate to retain the splendid faculty on the meagre sal - aries paid. The highest educational qualifications and the most success - ul experience are required, and yet the salaries paid do not compare avorably with many public school positions in Nebraska. The highest salary paid in any department is $1,540 for a service of eleven months, 'eachers in the model schools receive $100 per month. These salaries lould be sufficiently increased to give just compensation for efficient ervice. Financial Statement Herewith we submit an itemized statement of finances covering both appropriated and cash funds, summarizing those appropriations closing April 1, 1909, and itemizing carefully the appropriations be ginning at that time. Permit me to call your attention to the fact that although the Kearney Normal has accommodated a large attendance and it has been necessary to equip constantly for additional numbers an expanding cirriculum, we have never presented a deficiency but have been able to live within our income. We take just pride in this record, and hope the coming session of the Nebraska legislature will fully ap- preciate the careful expenditure of the funds entrusted to our car Estimate of Expenses for the Coming Biennium. After carefully estimating the funds necessary to insure the highest efficiency for the coming biennium, we ask that the following appropria- tions be made. A less amount would hamper the efficiency and growth of the institution. The fact that we have lived within our means and that no deficiencies have been presented during the three bienniums in which the school has been operated ought to inspire confidence on the nd offer some inducement for the proper mainten am Maintenance — Consisting of office supplies, fuel, lights, water, postage, telegraph, freight, drayage, telephone, express, furniture and equipment, commencement expenses, physi cal education, domestic science, traveling expenses, man ual training and incidentals ■).00 General Repairs 00 Salary of principal, teachers, secretary, registrar, librarian and assistants, $47,910.00. For biennium " ' New building — The last legislature made an appropriation of $50,000 for the north wing. The new building will be ready for ocupancy in January, 1911. This will relieve the pressure somewhat, but will not provide for the full - teBt operation of the departments eventually to be located in the south wing. This includes the Department of Employees' wages, $3. for bienniutn </seg>

This addition will greatly facilitate the work of the institution. The 150,000 appropriated by the last legislature was not suffi - cient to build according to the plans, and it was neces - sary to modify the building more than is expedient. We are therefore asking for JOO Total J183.260.00 Very Respectfully A. O. THOMAS, President PERU Peru, Nebr., December 1, 1910 To the Nebraska State Board of Education Gentlemen: I am pleased to submit herewith a report of the prog - ress of the State Normal School at Peru, together with a detailed ac - count of the receipts and expenditures for the biennium now closing. Progress. The biennium now closing has witnessed a remarkable increase in the advancement of educational standards in Nebraska. Every part of the state has shown its interest in this advancement by its activity in advocating better facilities for the education of the boys and girls of the state. The Peru State Normal has shared in this progressive move - ment. The present year indicates a continuation of the phenomenal growth that has characterized the school during the past decade. You will be interested to know that in spite of the fact that the catalogs and other advertising material for the fall term, were not ready in time to place them in the hands of prospective students until within two weeks of the beginning of the term; in spite of the misunderstanding arising because of the difficulty met in the interpretation of the rules on equivalents and the consequent disappointment of a large number of last year's candidates for graduation, the present year has opened with the usual large enrollment. The number of those graduating this year will probably "be the largest in the history of the school, notwithstanding the fact that the standards are higher and the requirements more rigid t^ian ever before. The character of the student body and the fine school spirit prevailing </seg>
            <seg id="p057">STATE BOARD OF K.DL CATION are indicated by the activity of the Christian organizations and in all the social interests of the school. This is shown in the very large percentage of the young men that are active in the work of the T. M C. A. and in the unprecedented membership in the Y. W. C. A. This organization now enrolls 300 girls. The Normal Catholic Christian As- sociation is another society well represented this year and one which is an active agent in the school for higher types of Christian manhood and womanhood Faculty. he board of education has been most fortunate in electing to posi- tions on the faculty to take the place of those who resigned, or who have been granted a leave of absence, men and women who are es rilly strong in their particular fields of work. Without exception, e new members are winning the confidence and respect of stu- dents and faculty alike. The members of the faculty who have been with the institution a longer period have proved thei/ right to the con- fidence and hearty support of all interested in the welfare of the school. Every act is that of loyal co-operation to assist in every possible way in carrying out the policies of the school. A number of the faculty mem hers have refused to consider offers from other institutions which car- ried with them promise of larger remuneration. Their refusal to ac- cept other positions is due in large part to the love they cherish for the old school. Some have accepted other positions and there are others who can scarcely be expected to continue in the service of the state normal, unless advancement can be made in salaries. With but wo exceptions, no member of the faculty receives more than the maxi- mum of $1,600 per annum. The increase in the cost of living and the general increase of salaries, all over the country, make it imperative schedule receive careful consideration by the members that th Employees. i body of men and The Peru Normal at the present time poss cient and are willingly rendering the w it are e he stat Notwithstanding their willingness to best possible serv do everything possible to keep th buildings clean and in good repair, and to furnish the light and heat necessary for the school, the present I would call your attention to the addition of the rce is inac ew administration building which will necessitate increased janitor lelp, and also to the fact that the buildings are left entirely without night watch from 10 p. m., to 4 a. m., during the winter months Considering the money invested by the state in the property here and the fact that fires must be left under the boilers during the night, it would seem to be economy to provide a night watch, especially during the cold weather </seg>
            <seg id="p058">H BIENNIAL REPORT New Rules for Graduation. The new rules recently adopted by the state board of education for checking out graduates have made the interpretation of the course of study and the state department rules on equivalents very simple. I believe that this will greatly facilitate the matter of checking out stu - dents and that it will enable a student to determine at the beginning of any school year whether he will be able to complete the requirement* for graduation in that year. Increased Demand for Normal Graduates There is an increased demand on the part of boards of educa - tion and school superintendents for graduates of the state normal schools. This Is due in part to the laws relative to the employment of normal trained teachers in accredited high schools, but in the larger part to the superior work that normal praduates are able to do. The Peru Normal School is unable to supply half the demands that come from boards of education for its students. The establishment of the new normal schools by the last legislature has not decreased the inter - est In the schools already existing. It has had a tendency to popularize normal training and will increase the demand for normal trained teachers. The attendance has not been affected nor has the demand for our students lessened in any degree. On the contrary the result has seemed to be a general awakening over the state regarding the ne - cessity of the employment of only normal trained teachers. The New Administration Building. The new administration building is now nearing completion. Its completion means the addition of eleven fine recitation rooms and will enable the president and the registrar, together with the clerical force, to move their offices out of the cloak rooms of the chapel. Estimates for Next Biennium. You will notice that the total estimates for the next biennium, amounts to $31,100 less than the estimates made for the last biennium. This is due to the fact that we are not asking for appropriations for any new buildings, excepting for a small appropriation to complete the library building which was started four years ago. I have attempted to make a conservative estimate, asking only for the actual needs of the institution. There are slight increases in some of the estimates over those made two years ago. These increases, as explained under their proper headings, are due to the growth of the school, to the addition of other departments to meet the needs of the state course of study, and the demands for trained teachers in special lines of work, as domestic economy, agriculture, manual training, art, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">TATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 59 Curtailment of Expenses. LI have found it necessary in the closing months of the biennium curtail the expenditures for every department. In fact, it has been tessary to deprive many of the departments of their actual needs in order that there might not be a deficit at the close of the biennium. In spite of this curtailment there will be a deficit approximating $2,500 in the salary appropriation. This has not been due to raising of sal - aries nor to the employment of additional members of the faculty, but simply to the fact that the appropriation for salaries the last biennium was inadequate to meet the growing needs of the school. In this con - tction I would ask you to note that the model school has been running greater part of the biennium with one less training teacher than at e beginning of the biennium; that during one year of the biennium the biological department was compelled to employ student assistants in place of an associate professor in order that the funds might not be overdrawn. Maintenance. Eie estimate for maintenance this biennium is slightly larger than e biennium just closed. However, when the increased expendi - necessitated by the additional building are taken into considera t is doubtful whether the estimate is large enough. Salaries. The apropriation asked for under this heading will not admit of of any material increase in salaries during the next biennium. While it is true that our estimate is $1,000 larger than the estimate made for the biennium now closed, and $5,000 larger than the appropriation made by the last legislature, we call your attention to the deficit of $2,500 this biennium in the salary appropriation, also to the fact that there has been one training teacher less in the model school, whose place must be filled this year. Also to the vacancy that existed one year in the biological department. 1 would also have you note that it will be necessary to employ a teacher of art in the normal school. While the course of study demands training in art of all graduates, the Peru .Nor mal has not had an art teacher for the past three years outside o the model school. Provision must be made for a manual training teach er. Peru is the only state normal in Nebraska that does not employ a teacher for some phase of manual training. When these two or three additions are taken into consideration and when provision has been made for teachers where departments have not been kept up because of lack of salary appropriations, you will see the necessity of the smal increase in our estimate for salaries. Employees' Wages Under employees' wages I have asked for $12,000 for the biennium </seg>
            <seg id="p060">6u BIENNIAL REPORT In this I have included salaries for office help and for all other em - ployees. The monthly pay roll of these persons under the present sal - ary schedule is $495. It will therefore be impossible to advance em - ployees' salaries under the present estimate of $12,000. General Repairs This is an item which will demand very careful consideration. It is the intention to include not only general repairs but also the unusual repairs under the estimate made at the beginning of this biennium. You will note that I am asking for $1,000 less than the estimate made then. This item of $15,000 is intended to cover all usual repairs, the re - modeling of the main building, putting on a new roof, putting in new floors and new windows, repainting the main building and two or three other buildings. It is impossible to keep the main building warm in the severe weather in its present condition. This item also covers the vault fixtures for the new administration building and the enlargement of the sewer system. It is important that the sewer system be extend - ed and provision made for taking care of the sewerage. At the pres - ent time it is allowed to flow thru the main part of town and is proving a menace to the health of the people of Peru. Many of the rooms need re-papering, recalcimining or re-painting. The campus should be re - fenced. There are several rooms that are without radiators or other method of heating. Principal's Traveling Expenses. The state normal schools, unlike the state university, have no method of bringing their work to the attention of the different high schools and the people in the different sections of the state. The principals of the normal schools are called upon to go to different parts of the state, to many places where their expenses cannot be borne by the schools and the teachers' associations which need their help. To meet the necessary expenses incident to the work that the principals are called upon to do, the appropriation for traveling expenses should be at least twice as large as heretofore. Manual Training. I have asked for $2,000 in the present estimate to equip the manual training rooms. We have in the new power plant an excellent room for this purpose. Many of the necessary tools are already owned by the state. All we lack is a little additional equipment and the employment of a manual training teacher. Additional Story on the Library Our estimate of $12,000 is intended to include the completion cf th« new library building by adding one story. This was the intention when the building was started four years ago. The growth of the school and </seg>
            <seg id="p061">STATE BOARD OF KDl'CATION 61 Ee growth of the library, which now consists of 25,000 library books, xt books and periodicals, makes it mandatory that more library room : provided.

            <seg id="p062">I BIENNIAL REPORT balance of the appropriation fund was $19,305.79. This sum w meet all necessary expenditures for maintenance until April 1, 1911, a it was the wish of the Board, as well as my own personal desire, to keep the expenditures entirely within the appropriation. This fund will be inadequate to meet the real needs of the school, but un je thing unforeseen occurs, making an unusual expense absolutely neces - sary, we shall not go before the legislature with a single deficiency claim All departments for which teachers have been employed are now well organized and doing excellent work. We have a fine body o earnest, hard working students and an exceptionally strong faculty, wel qualified both in scholarship and experience to help build up a grea educational institution in northeast Nebraska. Lack of funds has mad it impossible to employ teachers for all necessary departments. Onl those departments which were considered absolutely indispensable hav been organized. We have been compelled to get along without teachers of Music, Reading, Physical Culture, and, instead of a preceptress, thi duty has been performed by two of the lady teachers. Provisions fo carrying on the work of these departments should be made at the earliest possible date. In addition to this we shall also need an assis- tant in English, one in Science and one in Mathematics. A Model School, consisting of grades one, three, five and seven has been organized, and the work is being conducted in one of the ward school buildings, the use of which is furnished free to the state by the school district of Wayne. While it is fortunate that such an ar - rangement could be made to meet temporary needs, the present plan is far from satisfactory. The work has been seriously hampered in having only four grades represented, and also from the fact that students have been compelled to go some distance from the Normal in order to observe the work of the practice school. Suitable Model School rooms should be provided in our own buildings, and as soon as funds are available, a kindergarten teacher and a teacher for intermediate grades should be employed in order to exemplify the work as it should be done in a well equipped training school. In our opening in September, the school was at a great ar tage because during the summer prospective students found it impo sible to learn whether the old school would close its work indefinitel continue for another year under private management, or open as State Normal. Even as late as August a number of young men an young women, unable to get replies from their inquiries, made arrang ments to attend other institutions. No advertising of any character was done during the year preceding. As we have only a small fund whic can be used for printing, little has been done so far to advertise th school, except by personal correspondence. During the last tw months an unusually large number of inquiries have been received fro </seg>
            <seg id="p063">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION those who wish to prepare for teaching. Many of these young people have made arrangements to enroll on January 3, 1911, following the holiday vacation. The fact that the enrollment of the school has more Kn doubled since the opening in September gives assurance of an at - dance that will tax our present buildings and equipment to the limit the close of this year. With our splendid faculty, and because of he great demand for trained teachers, the attendance will soon be han can ~be accommodated in our present quarters. For this should have a new building in which to accommodate the i of Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Agriculture, and Geography. x&gt;m in which to install proper laboratory facilities with hich to carry on this work. At the present time two small recitation sms located on the third story of the old building are being used for Library. Another urgent need for a new building is to provide a suitable place for a reference Library The old building is in bad condition and poorly arranged for the work which must be carried on in it. The rooms are entirely too small ind the construction of the building is such that it is impossible to en- large them. The entire structure is in need of repair. The furniture is very inferior quality and in no sense suited to the needs of the school. Much of this should be replaced or supplemented with modern school furniture The dormitories, aside from needing paint, are in fair condition, but all the rooms are equipped for the most part with home-made furni- ture. As fast as the funds will permit these rooms should be provided with better furniture, which will give a more comfortable and home-like appearance to the room Our water supply is very meagre and uncertain. We do not have connection with the city water system, but depend upon our own water supply, which is afforded by a small pump operated by a 2-horse-power gasoline engine. A small storage tank, supported on a tower about forty feet high is the only means we have for forcing water into the leating plant and distributing it to the hydrants on the grounds. We wholly without fire protection and water supply in the buildings. We need a larger well, a larger pump, and a tank on a tower high mist protection and an abundance of water for hroughout the buildings. We also need a com c plete sewer system as we have no connection with the city sewer, and ms impossible to secure this connection on account of the ravine ■en the school grounds and the city. An outlet for an independent *wer can easily be constructed by the state by following the ravine he east end of the grounds to the Logan. This is a distance of 7,000 feet, but there is a gradual fall and at no place will it b« han five or six feet. This plan, hdwever, would c probably cost considerably more than is indicated in the estimate in- </seg>
