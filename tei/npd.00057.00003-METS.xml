            <seg id="p002"/>
            <seg id="p003">3 FOREWORD To His Excellency, the Governor : The Board of Control herewith transmits the Fifth Biennial Report of the State Institutions of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1923. The biennium formerly ended on November 30 of each even-numbered year, but this date was changed by an act of the legislature, so that this report really covers a period of thirty-one months from December 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923. During the period, no change has occurred in the personnel of the Board, but several changes have been made in the chief officers of institutions. Dr. Beverly A. Finkle, superintendent of the Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska, resigned to enter private practice, and was succeeded on August 23, 1921, by Dr. J. H. Matthai. Miss Amy V. Stevens, who had been superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln, Nebraska, for a number of years, resigned on July 5, 1922, being succeeded by her sister, Miss Nellie Stevens. The latter served until February 19, 1923, when her resignation was received, and Miss Lena Driever was appointed to the position. We call attention with pride and pleasure to the fact that the report shows the institutions to have gone through the bien - nium without incurring any deficiencies ; although the cost of living, and consequently the cost of supporting the state's depen - dents, has certainly not decreased since the appropriations were made for the biennium. Some improvements of a permament character have been made at the various institutions during the period covered by this report. A hospital building, bakery and scullery have been erected at the Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska ; a cottage for girls at the Girls' Training School, Geneva, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Burkett, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska ; a gymnasium building at the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, Nebraska ; a farm house and a barn at the Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a warehouse at the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska ; a kitchen building at the Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska ; a main building at the State Reformatory for Women, York, Nebraska. These buildings were badly needed, and they will have to be followed by others in the very near future if our wa'rds are to be properly, efficiently and economically cared for. The legislature just past made provision for two or three buildings, but failed to see the necessity for several others that were urgently requested. Brief mention was made in the last report of the establishment of the Reformatory for Men at Lincoln, but the importance of the institution calls, we believe, for rather more extended notice. This institution was established as a result, primarily, of a wide recognition of the need of segregating young first-term offenders from more mature criminals. The legislature of 1921 authorized the establishment, therefore, of such an institution, making an initial approproation of $300,000. Of this sum the Board ex - pended $37,500 for 10 acres and a brick building known as the Hay ward Military Academy, later buying about 152 acres of contiguous land for the sum of $49,531.25. This land is used for farming, stock raising, dairying, and intensive gardening. Various trades are taught such as tailoring, shoe repairing, carpentry and joinery, brick laying, electricity, automobile repairing, launder - ing, engineering, firing, and barbering. The manual labor about the institution is, of course, performed by the inmates, of which there are at this date 189. Mr. A. W. Miller, the superintendent, is doing much constructive work with the young men committed to his charge, and we believe the institution is amply justifying itself. The difficulty of employing the penitentiary inmates at suitable labor that does not conflict too much with the prerogatives of the free workers of our state, has been pretty well overcome. The state still operates the fibre furniture factory which has been at the prison for some years, and has also established relations with the Oberman Company by which shirts are made and disposed of with a minimum of competition with free labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 INMATE POPULATION There are seventeen institutions under the control of the Board, and at this time (July 1, 1^23) the inmate population is 5917, as compared with an average of 4 (i S0 for the biennium ending in 1921, and 4907 for the biennium just prior to that.

About 800 acres are rented in addition. Details of operation are given in the reports from the several superintendents which are appended hereto. The health of the inmate population has been generally good during the past biennium. We are pleased to be able to report that no epidemic has broken out at any of the institutions, and our medical men have been able to cope with such sporadic cases of contagious disease as have appeared. In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of the officers and employees of the various institutions in striving to bring about a betterment of the living conditions of the wards under their care. We wish also to thank the Governor for his manifestations of interest and for his assistance in the work of this department, and we trust that he will continue his efforts to help us provide better means of caring for the wards of the state.

            <seg id="p019">19 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska : I herewith present the report of the Hospital for Tuberculous for the period ending June 30, 1923. During this period the new building has been practically completed and much of the equipment purchased and received. As yet, however, the building has not been put into use, but will be very soon. A new boiler has been installed and two old ones have been reset. A room has been built for a sterilizer and the latter has been installed. Outside of a few fire extinguishers and the equipment for the new building, very little new furniture has been purchased. The asbestone floor in the library addition gave out and a terrazza floor was put in its place. Several partitions were removed in the basement of the hospital building and the general arrange - ment improved making the serving of meals more convenient. Our grounds have been given considerable care and as a conse - quence the institution as a whole presents at this time a much more pleasing appearance. The ex-service men have been very kindly dealt with by the members of the American Legion and Auxiliaries; canned fruit, jelly, cake, etc. being sent in abundantly. A high grade radio apparatus, presented by the W. C. T. U. has given much enjoyment not only to the ex-service men, but to many others. Ministers and various organizations have entertained the patients in different ways, and the people of Kearney have been very kind to the institution. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Work of the Hospital Citizens of Nebraska afflicted with tuberculosis are eligible for treatment in this institution. If they are without means of support, a certificate from the county commissioners to this effect, together with the application blank from a practicing physician, is all that is necessary. If, however, the patient or his relatives can afford to pay (from $10.00 to $ 30.00 a month), they should do so in proportion to their financial ability. The maximum charge asked is barely half the actual cost to the state. The duration of treatment here depends upon the nature and circumstances of the individual case. If a patient delays putting himself under proper treatment until he has suffered extensive damage, the necessary period of treatment will be proportionately prolonged ; and improvement or recovery may be impossible. Clothing is not furnished patients in this institution. Patients should come prepared to stay, if a favorable case, for a considerable length of time. One cannot get well in a month or two. All the effect and time is lost in too short a stay, and one runs the risk of making his disease more chronic and unfavorable. While it is the purpose of this institution to treat pulmonary tuberculosis with the idea in mind of bringing about a cure or an arrest of the disease, it is not considered .sufficient to stop there. Where possible, we aim to assist the individual to take his place as a self-sustaining unit in the community. To this end, we are employing occupational therapy in such cases as are able to take this work. Also, we are co-operating with the state department of vocational training. A number of our patients are taking training along various lines. We find that such as are able to do this are benefited physically as well as improved mentally, for the reason that persons who have an aim in life and are able to look forward to the time when they may again become useful, are much better off. A school is maintained for the children. They spend the forenoon in the school-room, as it is considered that this is as much time as these children should be in school. The children spend the afternoon in bed, as do all the patients. Religious services are held every Sunday afternoon at 3 :30. Patients are encouraged to attend these services but attendance is </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 purely voluntary. Concerts, lectures and various entertainments are given throughout the year and in this way are secured the well - being of the patients and that contendedness of mind so necessary to the best results. In closing, I wish to thank all the members of the Board for their kindly feeling toward the institution and their spirit of co - operation with me at all times. Respectfully submitted, L. T. SIDWELL, Superintendent. </seg>
