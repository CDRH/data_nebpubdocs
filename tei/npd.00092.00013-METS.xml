         <seg id="p001">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 328 Additional data show comparisons as to time of maturity, test weight per bushel, and percentages of leaf and stem rust. Mindum and Thatcher are fairly resistant to stern rust, while some of the newer strains such as Pilot and Rival carry still more resistance. Tests at North Platte.—The agronomic data and yields of the spring - wheat varieties grown at the Substation during the years 1931 to 1939 are presented in Table 13. There was a crop failure in 1934 due to drouth and no spring wheat was grown in plots in 1935. Most of these years have been severe on spring wheat and the yields have been low. The differences between varieties cannot be considered very significant. Ceres has been grown since 1925 and in most years it has ranked high in yield. Although the variety is as late in maturing as Marquis it has been superior because of greater drouth and stem-rust resistance. Thatcher, grown for the four years 1936 to 1939, has yielded slightly less than Ceres. The rust-resistant varieties, Rival, Premier, Pilot, and Merit, have not been grown long enough to establish their yielding ability definitely. Tests at Alliance. —Tests have been conducted on the Experiment Farm since 1931 as shown in Table 14. No crop was harvested in 1934 because of drouth, and during several other years yields were rather low. For the eight-year period 1931-39, excluding 1934, Thatcher and Mindum ranked the highest with Reward ranking third. For the two-year period 1938-39 Thatcher, Mindum, and Rival had the highest average yields. Some data on rust and other agronomic factors are also presented in the table. Summary of tests at the three stations. —The average yields of six spring - wheat varieties grown at the three stations during the period 1931-39 are given in Table 15. Thatcher has ranked second at Lincoln, first at Alli - ance, and third at North Platte, while Ceres has been the leading variety at North Platte, fourth at Lincoln, and fifth at Alliance. Marquis has been the lowest-yielding variety at all stations. Mindum was first at Lincoln, fifth at North Platte, and second at Alliance. Most of the early-ripening varieties have given comparatively higher yields at Lincoln than at North Platte or Alliance. Descriptions of Important Spring Wheat Varieties The characteristics of varieties of interest in Nebraska are described in the following paragraphs. Of those that are commercially available in the state at this time, Thatcher and Ceres are recommended. Marquis (Nehr. No. 1001, C. I. No. 3641).—Since 1931 this standard variety has been used as a check. The variety is now among those ripening latest in the tests and is badly injured if stem rust is present. In the absence of rust Marquis'yields fairly well and the grain is attractive to the miling trade. Until recently it was widely grown throughout the spring-wheat territory, but is now being replaced rapidly by other varieties. At Lincoln, North Platte, and Alliance, Marquis is the lowest-yielding variety. Ceres (Nebr. No. 1028, C. I. No. 6900).—Ceres was produced from a Kota x Marquis cross made in North Dakota. The variety is bearded </seg>

Ceres has yielded 44 per cent more than Marquis at Lincoln, 32 per cent more at North Platte, and about 27 per cent more at Alliance. The variety is fairly popular in the western part of the state and its production may be encouraged. Komar (Nebr. No. 1034, C. I. No. 8004).—A sister selection of Ceres, this variety was named and increased because of a good yield performance in lowa, Nebraska, and Colorado. Komar is inclined to be just a little later than Ceres and is more stem-rust resistant but is as susceptible to leaf rust as is Ceres. Komar has outyielded Ceres at both Lincoln and Alliance, and at North Platte it has been slightly outyielded by Ceres. On the basis of yield alone it should be recommended but the milling trade is not favorable to the variety. The kernels are so hard that they require more tempering than other varieties. If milled alone it can be handled satisfactorily but if mixed with each other varieties it may cause some difficulty. Java (Kearney) (Nebr. No. 1009, C. I. No. 6585).—Seed of this wheat was obtained from Kearney county in 1911 and later identified as Early Java. It is fairly early, is resistant to Hessian fly, is susceptible to both leaf and stem rust but due to earliness escapes some injury. At Lincoln it has outyielded Marquis by 52 per cent, at North Platte by 27 per cent, and at Alliance by 32 per cent. The grain is inclined to be soft and is not liked by the trade. Because of poor milling and baking characteristics, the growing of this variety should be discouraged. Reward (Nebr. No. 1073, C. I. No. 8182).—Reward is the result of a cross between Marquis and Prelude made in Canada. Its advantages are early maturity, some degree of rust resistance, high test weight, and acceptable milling and baking characteristics. At Lincoln, Reward has yielded about 80 per cent more than Marquis, compared with 8 per cent more at North Platte and 35 per cent more at Alliance. Only Thatcher has a better yield record at Alliance than has Reward. Thatcher (Nebr. No. 1106, C. I. No. 10003).—Thatcher is the result of a cross (Kanred-Marquis x Marquis-Iumillo) made in Minnesota, and fora </seg>
         <seg id="p006">Varieties of Oats, Barley, and Spring Wheat in Nebraska num'xr o£ years was known as "Double Cross." Its outstanding character - istic is resistance to stem rust, and because of this it has spread very rapidly in commercial production. It is susceptible to leaf rust. Thatcher is an awnless' variety of such recent origin that its adaptation is not yet well denned. In relative yield it ranks highest of all varieties at Lincoln and it Alliance, but it has not equaled the yield of Ceres at North Platte. The milling and baking characteristics are satisfactory to the trade. Thatcher is a recommended variety for Nebraska. .: Mindum (Nebr. No. 1080, C. I. No. 5296).—This is the only variety of durum wheat still growing in plot tests. It is late but highly resistant to both leaf and stem rust. Mindum has outyielded Marquis at both Lin - coln and Alliance by a rather wide margin, and is about equal to Marquis in yield at North Platte. On the basis of yield the variety, should be en - couraged but the question of a favorable market arises. .There is a limited demand for home-grown durum in the state but when this is satisfied the supply must compete with other durum wheat on the Minne - apolis market and the.Nebraska crop is very apt to receive a lower price. If dirum becomes mixed with hard red winter or hard red spring the mixtures are discounted rather severely, find many elevators are not equipped to handle several types of wheat so as to insure purity. Unless grown under contract, or with a definite understanding as to the market, the growing of durum wheat in Nebraska should be discouraged. Dixon (C. I. No. 6049).—This variety is known as Humpback II or Canadian Club and by the grain trade as Ghirka. For a number of years the variety has been popular with some farmers in western Nebraska, although the acreage is rapidly decreasing. In tests at Alliance the variety has rusted rather heavily and has been outyielded by Ceres, Komar, Thatther, and Reward. It is a semihard red spring wheat and has a very hump on the kernel. The variety is disliked by millers and if found as a mixture in samples of spring wheat in amounts of more than 110 per cent, the sample is graded red spring, inflicting a severe discount in price. It' has been found that Dixon produces from 2 to 4 per cent less flour per bushel of grain than do Marquis or Ceres. The flour is soft and velvety compared to the more desirable granular texture of other hard red spring varieties. A different tempering process is required for the proper mill - ing of Dixon, which is serious especially if Dixon is present in a mixture. Usually the flour is low in water absorption, while the crumb color of the bread may be gray and of poor texture. In view of the poor yield record at Alliance and the objectionable milling and baking characteristics, there seems to be no reason for growing the variety. ¦ ¦¦.¦¦¦; ¦..;.; -;:-,;-; SUMMARY ;; -;..; \-,\ : .

         <seg id="p007">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 328 acreages of barley and spring wheat. This increase in spring wheat is likely to prove temporary, and is probably the result of heavy abandonment of winter wheat in the western part of the state caused by drouth. The increase in barley acreage has resulted from the distribution of superior varieties and to a growing recognition of its higher productivity compared with oats. The highest-yielding varieties of oats at Lincoln are Brunker, Burt selection (Nebr. No. 518), Burt selection (Nebr. No. 520), and Trojan. At Alliance, Trojan, Burt selection (Nebr. No. 520), and Kanota have the have the highest yields. Brunker, Trojan, Burt (C. I. No. 293), and Ful - jjhum (C. 1. No. 708) have been the high yielding varieties at North Platte. Brunker is recommended for the central and western sections of the state, togold and Burt selection (Nebr. No. 518) for the southeastern section and in areas where irrigation is practiced, and Burt selection (Nebr. No. 518) and Kanota if seeded early in central and northeastern Nebraska. Among the barley varieties giving the highest yields at Lincoln are Spartan. Club Mariout, Short Comfort, and Flynn. Spartan, Flynn, Ezond, and Trebi are the highest in yield at Alliance. At North Platte, Ezond, North Platte No. I, Spartan, and Short Comfort have yielded very well. Those varieties on the recommended list are Spartan, Short Comfort, Trebi. and Club Mariout. Thatcher, Reward, Komar, and Mindum are varieties of spring wheat yielding the highest at Lincoln. At Alliance, Thatcher, Komar, Reward, and Mindum are the most outstanding. Ceres, Komar, and Thatcher have been the outstanding varieties at North Platte. Thatcher and Ceres are recommended for growing in the state. Mindum and other durum varieties no longer outyield varieties of hard red spring wheats in Nebraska and their production is discouraged. , [10 mi </seg>
