            <seg id="p008">IN MEMORIAM Dr. Charles E. Bessey By Chancellor Samuel Avery For more than thirty years Dr. Charles E. Bessey served the University of Nebraska in the various capacities of Professor of Botany, Dean, Acting Chancellor, and Head Dean. He was known all over the world for his scientific achievements and through him the University became known to a large number of people who might otherwise have remained ignorant of its great service. Dr. Bessey's greatness was threefold, — namely great as a teacher, great as a scientist, and great in his personal relations with his fellow men. His great kindness, particularly to fresh - men, his natural sympathy and close personal touch with the stu - dents endeared him to his students, many of whom are now holding responsible positions in the field of science. In his rela - tions with his colleagues onthe faculty he did much to promote internal harmony and peace. Dr. Bessey was of great service to the public, belonging to horticultural societies, serving farmers' institutes, etc. He lived for the University as a whole, not for himself or his department, and with his passing away the University and the state lost a great man. </seg>

            <seg id="p011">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 11 SOME EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN NEBRASKA A. 0. THOMAS, State Superintendent A system of education is the expression of the state's desire to per - petuate itself. The state spends vast sums in preparing the coming generation for citizenship. The people pay their taxes to support the schools of the state without complaining. It is the legacy of one genera - tion to another. We have begun to realize that the educational progress of the state bears direct ratio to its economical developement. The pngress of our common schools is identical with the progress of the commonwealth, and since our state is almost purely agricultural our chief concern is for the rural schools. The production of food is the most fundamental occupation know to mar, and fortunate is that state whose chief industry is agriculture. We are approaching an age in which our .great problem will be the struggle for bread. The lines between flesh and famine are becoming more clearly marked, and unless the gardens and granaries of America are conserved to the utmost we shall soon be facing old world problems. Our rural life should be our best life and every effort should be made to keep a standard people upon our farms. At present practically all of the forces operating upon the country places are centrifugal and tend to pile up our population in great centers. Chief among these forces are, first — a lack of social advantages for country people; second — the pro - verbial drudgery of farm life; and third — a lack of educational facilities. I am satisfied that these forces are remediable. If Nebraska expects t-&gt; reach her full fruition as a commonwealth she should begin without delay to devote special attention to her rural schools. Unless Nebraska begins soon and establishes an economic basis upon which to build her educational structure she will find herself confronted by a ton-heavy system and an intolerable burden of taxation such as some other states are struggling with at the present time. Nebraska presents great possibilities in the way of building an economic and ef - ficient system of public schools. We have a fine, open, agricultural counfry, rich and beautiful; a people intelligent, industrious and pros - perous, — the two conditions most ideal for school building. Our problem present? few complexities such as confront many other states. From the fact that our state is so largely agricultural we have during the last two years stressed better rural schools. At the same time we "have not neglected our towns and cities. In our effort we are grateful for the splendid cooperation of the county superintendents, the teachers, the press of the state, and the people themselves. Although the work has just begun we are deeply gratified by the results. I am also grate - ful to the splendid men and women who have composed the office force and who have labored intelligently and unselfishly for the advancement of our educational interests. Each deserves special commendation and praise for his part of the progress. It makes little difference about the present; the future will bear evidence that during the last two years th« foundation was laid in an awakened people for placing Nebraska educa - tionally forward among the progressive states of the Union. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT REPORT OF STATE WIDE CONFERENCE LINCOLN, NEBRASKA Sept. 6th and 7th, 1916 The ttate-wide rural school conference convened in Lincoln September 6 and 7 at the call issued by State Superintendent Thomas upon request of various organizations of farmers throughout the state. The prelimin - ary conference which convened in Lincoln in May appointed a special committee consisting of the State Superintendent, Secretary W. H. Campbell of the Educational Committee of the Farmers' Congress, and Honorable W. J. Taylor of Custer County. This committee was empow - ered to make provisions for the conference. At the morning delibera - tions in the Temple Theatre of the University, President C. H. Gustafson of the Farmers' Union presided. At the mass meetings held in the Audi - torium at the State Fair grounds in the afternoon J. D. Ream Master of the State Grange, presided . The following resolutions in the form of reports from the various committees were adopted: REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON COURSE OF STUDY AND PROGRAM Committee: State Superintendent A. O. Thomas; W. H. Campbell, Central City; C. H. Gustafson, Mead; J. O. Shroyer, Humboldt; E. Von Forell, Scottsbluff. favor a course of study providing for special emphasis on the essentials of a common education. rln keeping with the spirit and progress of the age, we recommend that vocational subjects be given proper place. . Farm accounting, including many of the common forms of business instruments, contracts, deeds, etc., with which every man comes in contact in his business relations, elementary science, sociology con - nected with civics and the duty of citizenship, economics and coopera - tion, business English, and hygiene and sanitation should find a place in the public school. 4. We favor music, public speaking, and library reference work. rWe believe that school instruction should bring a keener appreciation of life, and that any education is at fault which does not develop a habit of enjoyment in the finer resources of life. 6. We are pleased to go on record as favoring such instruction that there may be produced the habitual expression of consideration and good will toward others, and the elimination of social friction through the mediums of courtesy, good manners, and good form should be ac - quired as essentials of a liberal education. The influence of the school should be cooperative and support the influence of the home. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 13 7. Whereas, there is a large number of young people in the countr districts who have completed the eighth grade and find it impossible to leave home for school purposes, or who have outgrown the work of the common school, or who are compelled to work upon the farm until the fall work is done and whereas under the present arrange - ment of classes these young people find it impossible to enter, we therefore recommend such an arrangement of classes as will enable these young people to enter for a winter term in which they may pursue review subjects or advanced study especially along the lines of farm accounting, economics and business forms. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FINANCE Committee: W. J. Taylor, Merna; J. W. Parton, Morrill; J. M. Matzen, Fremont; E. D. Howe, Table Rock; D. H. Hummel, Nelson; M. F. Rickard, Guide Rock; U. D. Lute, Paxton. 1. There is need of a more equitable distribution of our temporary school fund and to this end we favor the distribuation of the three - fourths by county superintendents on enumeration rather than on average attendance. 2. Recognizing that Nebraska's greatest industry is farming and that the rural life should be conserved, and further that the best way to perpetuate the farms of Nebraska is to give the country children as good opportunities for an education as are now afforded the chil - dren of our towns, we therefore favor a general state levy of 2H mills for the support and encouragement of rural higher education. 3. We favor the sale of the state school lands. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON SELECTION AND TENURE OF OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL OFFICIALS Committee: W. T. Zigler, Marquette; Mrs. Sybil Olney, Stamford; Norman Shaffer, Hooper; E. L. Seely, Nelson; Eddy Holmes, Nemo; James Elliott, Morrill; T. C. Grimes, Broken Bow. 1. Since the public school is a matter of community interest, we oppose any method of selecting school officers that will take the selection of such officers out of the control of the local community. 2. We recommend that the state and county superintendents be elected on a non-partisan ballot for term of not less than four years subject to the recall. 3. We believe that the county superintendent should be elected by the vote in districts organized under Articles HI and VI. 4. Motion made and seconded that we favor such educational require - ments for the county superintendent as will insure competency in office. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CONSOLIDATION, TRANSPORTA- TION, AND TEACHERAGE Committee: H. A. Collins, Papillion; J. M. Burdick, Creighton; Ada M. Haldeman, Gering; Con. McCarthy, York; George Jones, Dawson; Mabel Kirk, Clay Center. rThat the rural school districts of our state be enlarged by the pro - cess of redistricting to a size sufficiently large that the valuation will support an adequate teaching force and give to the children in rural communities a more efficient and practical education. rWe favor a medium sized district in order to produce which it will be necessary in many instances in western Nebraska to reduce and in eastern Nebraska to increase the size of the district. The district should not be so large that the question of transportation would be a serious hindrance or present serious obstacles. 3. In the readjustment of district boundaries the same should be done after careful surveys and the whole people should be given a voice in the same. Counties desiring a readjustment of district boundaries conforming to economy and efficiency should have an opportunity, under competent authority, to do so. 4. That transportation of pupils be made to conform to the conditions in the locality with a view of convenience, efficiency and economy. rThat a tract of land of adequate size be owned by the district for a school site, teacherage and for demonstrating in horticultural and agricultural work that would add beauty and profit to a rural people. the plans for the construction of school buildings be submitted to the state superintendent for approval as to general sanitation. fThat our motto in this rural movement be — "Advanced Education in the Country for Country People." REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON STANDARDIZATION OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS Committee: W. G. Baker, St. Paul; E. S. Place, Tecumseh; C. A. Reed, Elk City; Stephen Norton, University Place; F. W. Kimball, Wakefield; John Radolf, Bruning. Because of a condition existing in many of the schools in the rural districts in which the school houses are lacking in proper facilities for heating, lighting and ventilating and are deficient in school equipment, we make the following recommendations for general improvement: 1. We recommend that laws be enacted providing that where new school buildings are to be erected, they must be of approved modern type; that the state superintendent cooperate with the rural school districts resiling to build by furnishing plans and specifictions of </seg>
            <seg id="p015">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 15 desirable buildings and upon the selection of any of these plans a blue print of the same, free of charge, should be sent to the district. 2. We recommend that the lighting be from the left and to the rear of the pupil and that there be no opposite arrangement of windows allowing: a cross light. 3. We recommend that each school building be equipped with single seats of the adjustable type. 4. We recommend that the equipment be adequate and that the text books be uniform throughout the county at least. 5. We recommend that wherever practical the old school building b« converted into a teacher's cottage. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON THE GOVERNMENT OF HIGHER INSTITUTIONS Committee: 0. E. Wood, Bethany; Carl E. Slatt, Edgar; C. V. Svodoba, St. Paul; John Gilmore, Valley. We favor a unit board for the management of the higher educational institutions of the state, the members of which board shall be voted for by the electors at large, but to be distributed among the congressional districts of the state; the terms of office to be for a period of six years, but subject to recall. The members of such board shall receive per diem am", actual expenses while performing the duties of their office. TOO MANY SHALL SCHOOLS In examining the annual reports submitted by the county superintend - ents we find a large number of districts supporting schools with few pupils, and these schools have obvious weaknesses. The census reveals: There were operated during the year just closed 7,223 schools, of 15 districts with 1 child each. 22 districts with 2 children each. 27 districts with 3 children each. 46 districts with 4 children each. 60 districts with 5 children each. 73 districts with 6 children each. 77 districts with 7 children each. 88 districts with 8 children each. 103 districts with 9 children each. 100 districts with 10 children each. 126 districts with 11 children each. 122 districts with 12 children each. 867 districts with a census of from one to twelve. lakini </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT which 652 are called graded and 6,571 are ungraded or single-teacher schools. Of these there were operated last year: 30 schools with 101 schools with 151 schools with 220 schools with 299 schools with 319 schools with 363 schools with 373 schools with 371 schools with 400 schools with 415 schools with 348 schools with but 1 child. but 2 children, but 3 children, but 4 children, but 5 children, but 6 children, but 7 children, but 8 children, but 9 children, but 10 children, but 11 children, but 12 children. ta total o' 3,390 schools operated during the school year 1915-16 out 6,571 with from 1 to 12 children. Bui this condition does not mark Nebraska alone; it is duplicated in a larpe number of states. I have before me a statement of the condition in New York state and there are reported 8,430 one-teacher schools, of which one-half have less than 10 pupils; 74 have but 2 pupils; 172 have but 3; 235 have but 4; 362 have but 5; 440 but 6; 533 but 7; 544 but 8: «37 but 9; 576 but 10. It costs as much to operate one of these small schools, so far as over - head expense is concerned, as it does a school of proper size, and the small school is the inefficient school. This condition should be remedied as rapidly as possible by proper combinations where districts are not OUR SCHOOLS COST A MILLION A MONTH The schools of the state, gathering funds from the several sources, spent last year a total of $11,879,439.72, — practically a million a month the year round to support the schools. This vast ingathering of gold found its sources as follows: Some districts operate with a low rate of taxation, while others levy the maximum amount, and still others, in their anxiety to provide ►irect taxation (local district) 'rom school lands and from interest on perma- nent funds 'ines and licenses "uition ill other sources )n hand at beginning of year $7,978,518.32 893,189.80 703,682.04 246,572.34 483,808.46 . 1,573,668.76 Total expenditure J »11,879,439.72 11,879,439.72 </seg>

There seems no real reason why one district should levy so much more than another, or why one district should have so much better school than another. It is interesting to note that out of 7,001 districts from which we reckon, in 1914-15 74 districts levied 0- 1 mill 613 districts levied 2- 5 mills 1925 districts levied 6-10 mills 1392 districts levied 11-15 mills 870 districts levied 16-20 mills 725 districts levied 21-25 mills 444 districts levied 26-30 mills 958 districts levied 31-50 mills From these figures it will be noted that 4,004 school districts am operating with 15 mills or less; 2,997 with more than 15 mills; 4374 districts are spending less than 21 mills; and 2,127 are spending more. In most instances the towns are supporting modern high schools while the country districts are providing for eight grades only. In most instances the towns and cities are paying from 20 to 35 mills; there are many country districts paying the same amount. In 1915-16, 365 dis - tricts found it impossible to provide seven months of school on the maximum levy and asked state aid, $385 being reckoned sufficient to maintain a country school seven months. These districts represent thirty-six counties. The schools of our towns and cities have for many years provided better equipment and have provided from two to four years high school. There are many reasons why the people should have the power to vote their own taxes and to the fullest extent possible, but with the small district unit an equitable adjustment seems impossible. Some districts will have a better school than others and some will vote the limit while others will be escaping the burden almost wholly. The demo - cratic principle involved in local management and privilege should be conserved as far as possible. For the equalization of the burden two methods may be proposed: First, a portion of the tax may be spread over the entire state and distributed in some equitable manner on overhead expenses, and the balance of the tax needed to conduct the schools may be voted on the local district directly by the people. This method would conserve practi - cally all of the Americanism of the present method Second, all districts now operating under Articlelll may be thrown into one tax district and the levy sufficient to operate all of the schools made by a county board. This would distribute the corporation tax, but the people would be deprived of the right to vote their own levies. This method would not remedy the difficulty which is now experienced l&gt;y the towns and cities of the state where high school improvement is </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT one of the chief virtues of the system. In fact, the welfare of the common schools is identical with the welfare of the commonwealth, and the whole state rather than each individual district is interested in the advancement of the system and each part should bear a just portion of the burden. LACK OF HIGH SCHOOL PRIVILEGES FOR COUNTRY CHILDREN The following "brief" is in the interest of the boys and girls who toil upon the farms and in the rural households of our state, and yet upon whose shoulders in large measure must fall the weight and res- ponsibility of maintaining against odds the standard of our best life, — rural life in an agricultural state. This is an increase of 2,797 over the year before and represents the results of the campaign for "Better Schools" in a somewhat larger attendance under the free tuition act and also the establishing of rural high schools covering ninth and tenth grades. It is significant to note that out of 32,525 high school students, 6,849 are country children who have taken advantage of the free atten- dance law. There are far more of our children in the country districts than in the city districts, yet less than one-fourth as many are getting any high school education. At a conservative estimate there are 30,000 country boys and girls who should be in high school, but who never have been and in all probability never will be. It never seemed to dawn upon the people that the rura. high school is feasible and that the high school of the open country has advantages over the city high school. When the country high school comes into its own it will seem strange to see city parents sending their children into it for a part of their education. Parents are loath to send their children of tender age away from home even for so priceless a thing as an education and they are not to be blamed for it. At the age when most children complete the eighth grade they need the home and its influences more than they need any - thing else, and the home has need of them. The average child upon the farm is a valuable asset and easily makes his "keep" while he is getting his schooling. During the last two years some emphasis has been placed upon rural high schools and a large number of them are now established and prove their worth conclusively. ere were enrolled in all of our high schools last year: Ninth grade high schools 411 Tenth grade high schools _ 2162 Eleventh grade high schools 2515 Twelfth grade high schools 27367 Total 32525 </seg>
            <seg id="p019">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 19 Last year there were 5,258 graduates from all high schools including ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade schools. They were distributed as follows: Ninth grade 202 Tenth grade 530 Eleventh grade 441 Twelfth grade 4085 SCHOOL CENSUS AND ATTENDANCE From the data furnished by the county superintendents in their last annual reports there seems to be a loss of children of school age during the last year; either this or the directors failed to find all chil - dren of school age. The census reports for the last six years are ma follows : While there was an apparent decrease in census, there was an in- crease of 4,480 in the number of pupils enrolled in school, with an increase of 3,475 in daily attendance. Only 77% of the children of school age en - rolled in the public schools last year: a portion of the others enrolled in parochial and private schools. The average daily attendance based upon enrollment is a fraction of 72' ', . The loss is mostly to the rural children. Country people find it somewhat easier to provide employment for their children than do the people of our towns and cities; consequently the attendance in our city schools is larger and more regular and a much larger percentage enroll. It is, however, not to the disadvantage of the country children that they require longer time and are somewhat older when they complete the eighth grade, but the disparity and the great disadvantage comes after this is done. COUNTRY CHILDREN AND EIGHTH GRADE EXAMINATIONS In order to meet requirements for the free high school attendance law a system of eighth grade examinations came into vogue some yean ago and has continued to the present time. My predecessors, as well aa I, have endeavored to make these examinations meet the real needa of country districts carrying eighth grades. Parents, teachers and county superintendents have been appealed to for suggestions and for sets of questions to be used. There are some who believe children complete the 1911 census 1912 census 1913 census . 1914 census 1915 census 1916 census ... 376.477 379,028 381,194 383382 387,522 384.477 </seg>

It is our experience that the questions cover the needs and are as difficult as they should be in fairness to the pupil. The fol - lowing summary of the examinations which closed the year of 1916 is of interest: Counties reporting, 88 out of 93: Two counties reporting did not give the number of boys and girls separately, but gave the total, 322 completing. This makes a total of 8,719 completions. Should this number be an average for the last four years, and it is reasonably fair to suppose it is, it would show 34.876 children of rural districts who are eligible under the free attendance law to the high schools of the state. Last year there were 6,849 attending school under the free attendance law. From these facts it is reasonable to suppose that there are more than 30,000 young people in the country districts who are eligible to enter the high schools of the state, but who have never entered and in all probability will not do so. Evidently there is need of rural high schools. AID TO WEAK DISTRICTS LFor some years the legislature has made appropriations for school ricts which are unable on their own resources to provide seven months of school. $385 is estimated as sufficient for this purpose. The legislature of 1913 appropriated $75,000 and the whole amount was required. The leg - islature of 1915 reduced this to $50,000 and the first year of the biennium required $28,283. Many of these districts have increased in assessed valuation and in the efficiency of expenditure, until the distribution for December 1916 is reduced to $16,000. distributed as follows: Boys taking examination Girls taking examination 6,064 7,090 13,340 Boys completing examinations.

If the appropriation of $50,000 is con - tinued by the coming legislature to relieve the indebtedness as well as to conduct seven months of school, these districts will in most instances become self-supporting, especially if the topography of districts con - taining less than twelve square miles will permit them to join neighbor- ing districts. EDUCATION IN NORTHWESTERN NEBRASKA. Northwestern Nebraska has its own educational problem. The larger allotment occupied by the dweller of this region as compared with the smaller unit of the eastern, section forces a condition peculiar to itself. A larger school district is necessary in order to bring together sufficient groups of children to warrant a school within reasonable cost to the people. Then again the nature of the basic activity of our northwest accustoms us to larger range. The combination of grain raising and live stock industry makes a reasonably easy and profitable life, but makes difficult the building of schools commensurate with the needs of the people. The great northwest is a valuable portion of our commonwealth. The whole eastern section is enriched by it and its welfare industrially and commercially adds largely to the wealth and prosperity of the whole state. The one section of the state is not only inerested in watching the development of the schools of the other, but is willing to help in that de - velopment, well knowing that the counry, or any part of it, cannot hope to thrive until the school is developed to reasonable efficiency. In an age like this parents will not take their children into a territory where schools are inaccessible and inefficient. The school therefore, is of first consideration, following settlement. If the proper system of schools can be built up in this section it will make a more permanent abode, in - crease the population and wealth and make richer the life of the country. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Our schools cannot be said to be efficient until we have brought equal chances to all the youth of the state. We must not be content with an elementary education gained by intermittent attendance. Efficiency and preparedness come through education and they are the watchwords of the age. We must have an open door and a chance for all who desire from the humblest country school to the highest learning, and to do this is a great problem. But the great problems of business and government are solved and why can we not solve our educational problem? Our problem is to bring educational facilities within reasonable reach and at reasonable cost. The difficulties we encounter in doing this are not insurmountable. They are, however, perplexing and will re - quire patient and persistent effort if we expect to accomplish desired results. In the sparsely settled sections the districts are so large that children are compelled to travel long distances, over temporary roads, through pastures and over streams which keep the parents uneasy during the time the children are absent from the home. This condition seems at present unavoidable because of the necessity for large areas in order to get sufficient revenue to maintain a school. The smaller land valuation, the quantity of land undeeded and the greater distances between settlers are obvious difficulties to be adjusted. A concerted effort on the part of the people backing up an intelli - gent program will work wonders in a short time. A district unit such as will serve the ultimate and developed country should be established and this should be determined by a careful analysis of conditions and by interested patrons who may be called into convention for the purpose of determining the most feasible and practicable unit. A tract four miles by four miles, making a district containing sixteen square miles, will place no child more than four miles from the school - house which should be located by law as nearly in the center as the lay of the land will permit. A distract broken on the half section line, five miles by five miles is area, and containing twenty-five square miles would place one child in twenty-five more than four miles from school. In a district six miles square one-half of the children would be more than three miles from the center. A reasonable allowance should be estab - lished by law for each family, not for each child, who lives beyond the three mile limit, or a systematic method of transportation employed. Three miles is not a great distance. As a boy it was my privilege to walk four and one-half miles for much of the schooling I received and it is little hardship to one who really wants an education. School schould be maintained in every district in which there is a reasonable number of children who will attend. This number should be determined largely by the dwellers of this section who are the interested parties. Should any established district not have a reasonable quota of children, some porvision should be made to get them into an adjojin - ing district or to establish the mother-teacher, in case the mother has sufficient educational qualification, and pay her the per capita cost for education in the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 23 The schoolhouse site should be located by law in the center of the district, but provision should be made, for a temporary shift in case the distribution of children should warrant, and in many localities the portable schoolhouse should be employed to cover temporary shifting of the population of the district. The change should be made by establish - ed and competent authority. In case a school does not have sufficient valuation to maintain a proper school the state at large, which will benefit by having all parts well supplied, should aid in the support. Adequate provision should be made for high school within all districts where there are sufficient children to warrant the same and in combinations of these districts, or by county or district high schools as the people of the various counties may chose. Such a system of education will enable dwellers of this "land of greater reach" to build up more rapidly and more substantially. It is true all of the hardships cannot be overcome, but they can be reduced to the minimum, and the vast majority ofour children given reasonable edu - cational accommodations. HOW TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM With the co-operation of all of our educational forces it will not be difficult to place Nebraska in the front rank among the states of the Union. We have every condition necessary upon which to build an ideal system of schools. We must re-organize our districts where possible in such manner that we may realize the four fundamental ideals : First: The small school must give place to a school containing groups of children of proper numbers in order to conserve the hundred cents on the dollar spent for maintaining school. Second: We need a division of labor for teachers. The new dis - trict unit will bring together from three to seven teachers and enable them to become specialists rather than to cover the entire curriculum. Third: We need to bring the high school within reach of the home. Fourth: The proper housing of rural teachers is essential to greater permanence and contentment on the part of the teachers. The newly consolidated district, half in Richardson and half in Nemaha counties, includes the above idea. They have a district of about the proper size. They have sufficient children for three teachers, — primary, grammar and high school. Their building is built on the community center plan. It will cost about $8,000. It will be modern in all its appointments. A small gasoline engine will furnish water pressure. They will also have an individual lighting system. Two large rooms and one small room can be thrown together so that the small room forms a stage for the two large rooms which provide the audi - torium. They have six acres of land and are reconstructing some of their old school buildings into a teacher's residence which will contain </seg>

The house will be modern. With a kitchenette the extra teachers may either do light housekeeping or board with the family. The principal is a college graduate and a graduate of an agricultural course. The wife has done special social center work. The principal, Professor Taylor, may keep a Jersey or two, some good grade pigs and chickens. The house rent is furnished free and he will be able to make the basis of his living. Mr. eylor and wife will receive $140 per month for their services. They 11 take care of the buildings and grounds during the summer months when most school grounds are neglected. The grounds will be parked and in five or six years a fine neighborhood park will be in evidence such as ought to be found in every school district in the state. The building can be used for community singing, literary societies, women's clubs and farmers' organizations. It is not infreqeunt that we hear educators say, "Give us more money and we shall give you better schools". This cry should not be raised until we have succeeded in getting one hundred cents out of every dollar the taxpayer puts into the system. Our great need is a proper economic basis for the raising of funds, a proper reorganiza - tion of 6ur districts and a pruning of our courses of study such as will produce efficiency both in our financial system and in our instruction. Efficiency is the watchword of the hour. Business reorganizes to meet it. Since the public school is the foundation of free government and a necessity for efficient business organization, why not make it an example of efficiency. It can be done but it must follow a definite aim which not only sees the need and the beginning but the end accomplished. With half of our schools operating with half a capacity it seems evident that we are a long way from efficiency taking no ac - count whatever of educational results. We are spending enough money now to carry a high school within reach of practically every home in the state if we conserve its purchasing power. The following needs are apparent: 1. An open door from the humblest country school in the state to the post-graduate course of the University. 2. We should provide as good schools for the country as we have for the town. U3. We should provide high school privileges within reasonable h of every home in the state. Country people want their children to have just as good an education and to be just as refined and cultured as their city cousins are. b4. We must cut the centrifugal forces which are now acting on rural life and which tend to pile up the people in the centers of pulation. 5. The schools may be made the centers of social life for country 6. We must arrange for a proper division of labor for our teachers </seg>
            <seg id="p025">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 25 Teachers cannot teach all of the subjects of the curriculum and do it successfully. By bringing three to five teachers together in the schools of the open country division of labor may be accomplished. 7. We must arrange for the proper housing of rural teachers. This can be done when the above aim is accomplished. 8. In a state whose chief activity is agriculture, our course of instruction should be connected with industrial life that the product of our schools may receive proper educational adjustment. 9. We must jrive more certain tenure of service to our teachers and supervisory officers, and must provide proper remuneration and greater security for the teacher who is prepared for her service. 10. Country teachers should be especially prepared for country schools; they should be in sympathy with the life in which they labor; should understand it; should be a part of it. TAKE THE SCHOOLS OUT OF POLITICS Before we can get far on the way to making Nebraska the best .-tate educationally in the Union, we must take our schools out of poli - tics. Our schools are too close to our state life, too intimately connec - ted with our progress to allow them to become a political football. A teacher's ability to render service does not depend upon political affiliation. The idea of a "job" should never be associated with our .-schools. A school position is a public service and should be so regarded both by the teacher and the public. The idea of a term or two in office and then get out to give someone else a chance has wrought havoc to the schools of the state in many instances. School teaching and the various lines associated therewith are professional and should be so regarded. One who is professional shuns a position which comes through political preferment. Most pro - fessional teachers prefer a position to which they are selected because of special fitness. The first thing the coming legislature should do is to take the state and county sperintendents out of the realm of party politics. While at the present time it seems best for the people to have the right of selection these officers should be placed upon non-partisan ballot The term of the county superintendent should be extended to at least four years and his election should come on other than presidential election years. The qualifications of county superintendents in education and experi - ence should be raised to meet the needs of more efficient supervision. There should be a special county superintendent's certificate based upon special preparation for the work he is to do with proper safe-gna'd t» counties with small population. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 26 STATE SCHOOL LANDS There has been considerable agitation from time to time relative to the sale of our school lands. It will be interesting to note that the total acreage acquired is 2,978,095.05, from which 1,091,731.74 acres are deeded and 233,971.71 acres are now under contract of sale. Of the balance 1,650,990.91 acres are under lease and would probably repre - sent the amount to be sold in case legislative action would put these lands on the market. There is no doubt that had the school lands been conserved during the last fifty years of statehood as private investments have been conserved, the permanent school fund at the present time would contain at least $30,000,000 instead of (9,034,308.18. We do not blame anyone in particular for this shortage. It was a part of the system of government and definite policies relating to the conservation of public resources only recently became emphasized . The $9,034,308.18 is at the present time invested in bonds at 5'/r with the exception of $3,237.85 which is in the hands of the state treasurer awaiting sufficient amount to invest. From this investment last year the state received $893,189.80 which was distributed by the state superintendent, one-fourth equally among the several districts of the state and three - fourths to the schools of the counties on school census.

Lit is a safe estimate that the 1,652,391.60 acres now under lease worth $20,000,000. From the lease of these lands there has accrued about $170,000 per annum which according to law is placed in the temporary school fund and divided as above mentioned. If the lands were sold at $20,000,000 and the money invested in bonds at 5%, from the investment would accrue $1,000,00 annually to be applied to the temporary school fund. In a period of twenty years the leases would amount to approximately $3,500,000, while under the investment the </seg>
            <seg id="p027">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 27 proceeds would approximate $20,000,000. On the other hand it ia possible that the lands retained for twenty years might be greatly enhanced in value and this is the point upon which hinges a difference of opinion. In all probability as an investment proposition, the sale of the lands, if properly administered, would represent the better business transaction. On the other hand, a reassessment of these lands and proper rental charges might approximate the income which would be derived from sale and investment. Land Commissioner Beckman and the Board of Public Lands and Buildings have already begun the readjustment of values and it is to be hoped that in the interest of the taxpayers and especially of the boys and girls of the state who are vitally interested in good schools, the state school lands may be conserved to the fullest extent. Hasty action should not be taken, but a careful investigation made of the full situation and action taken thereon. There is another side of the question. Most of the lands in the eastern portion of the state are already sold. The lands lying in the various school districts of the west are non-taxable, which in a measure cripples the school districts in raising fjinds for the support of the schools.

A NEW DISTRICT UNIT Many benefits may be derived through consolidation, but this in nearly every instance leaves irregular and non-uniform districts; more - over it does not conserve distance as a redistricting would do. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT In most counties of the state the school districts look like "crazy patch" work. In many instances they are from two miles square to two miles by three miles. The old ideal was to have schoolhouses two miles apart. Even in these small districts the children are traveling on an average about one -and one-half miles, &gt;.nd the average distance traveled by the children of the whole state is nearly three miles. A re - organization of school districts would effect some wonderful reforms. The following uniform district would prove advantageous not only from the standpoint of better schools, but it would conserve the purchasing power of the money spent for schools. The most advantageous size of districts in Nebraska is twelve to twenty square miles in the eastern portion, and from sixteen to thirty-six square miles in the western portion. The new district four miles by five miles, broken on the half section rather than the section line, seems to be conducive to the highest economy and efficiency, as it brings larger taxable area, from seventy to two hundred pupils, and from three to seven teachers together even in the open country schools. By breaking on the half section line instead of the section it gives larger taxable area without placing anyone further from school; in fact this form of organization will place about ninety - bper cent of the pupils within a radius of two miles of the school - se when located in the center of the district. Districts formerly operating under the old plan, paying 14 to 25 mills and carrying only eight grades, can reduce in most instances to 10 or 16 mills and operate a high school of at least ten grades. Such a district in the eastern half of the state would present a tax valuation of from $150,000 to $300,000. Such an arrangement would leave a country school with a valuation equal to or greater than that of most small towns, and if properly extended would increase the taxable area and reduce the burden of the towns even to the advantage of the country around. CIVIL SERVICE FOR TEACHERS One of the most apparent weaknesses of the public school system of our state and nation is the almost utter lack of conditions which safeguard the teacher. The spirit of the missionary and philanthropist is evident in the teacher's life. It is a noble spirit and the teacher who does not have a generous amount of it could scarcely be qualified for such an important calling. The teacher is in reality the rock upon which free institutions are bounded and the teacher is the one who must prepare in the schools of our country" the men and women of to - morrow for the duties of self government. Surely those who are en - gaged in such an important calling are worthy of the highest considera - tion and the laws of our state ought in so far as possible to safeguard the teacher and give opportunity to make teaching a profession rather than a stone i nan a Mriiping *»*v </seg>
            <seg id="p029">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 29 The ultimate good of the schools of our country cannot be reached by viewing; the situation from one side only. The schools exist chiefly for the rising- generation, but the welfare of the rising generation cannot be safeguarded unless we take proper cognizance of the instrument of means, — the teacher. Our observation reveals a disparaging situation for the teacher whose life as such is less than three years. The lack of stability together with the lack of proper remuneration does not attract and hold to the pro - fession those whose lives are not made up of more than ninety per cent of philanthropy. We have received data within the last two weeks direct from 4,632 teachers of the state and out of that number only 337 have taupht ten years or more. 2,919 have taught on an average of less than two years. There are only 1,506 male teachers in the state and is it any wonder, for they get an average monthly salary, upon which to live the year around, of $61.50. There are 11,137 female teachers who receive the immense wages of $43.83 per month upon which to live the year round, and out of this the teacher must attend summer schools and county institutes, subscribe for magazines and method books, must keep herself tidy and present a pleasant face to the school and a cheerful aspect toward her patrons. Surely in this period of high cost of living the teacher cannot be blamed for stepping out of the profession at the first opportunity.

To limit the number of certifi - cates in force in a county to the actual needs of the schools, or a grad - uated wage scale, would prove beneficial to the teachers of the State. The lack of stability of position is noticeable. Political whims, pre - judices, favoritisms, jealousies, church affiliations, and many other in - fluences often tend to relieve even worthy teachers and those who have rendered most excellent service in their positions. As to the tenure of service there is no reason why teachers might not be placed under civil service regulations; that is, after they have taken proper courses of instruction and are judged qualified in every particular to teach. When such qualifications are attained the teacher should be given a probational certificate good for three years. If the teacher's work is successful this probational certificate may become per - manent. If the teacher has taught three years in one school and is worthy to be re-employed, then she should be placed under civil service regulations and removed only for cause. I.nk..

In many instances teachers find it difficult to secure proper quarters. Those who are abundantly able and properly situated to board the teacher and to supply twith proper accommodations are often not inclined to do so either use they feel that the teacher will require additional care or that </seg>
            <seg id="p031">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 31 having come from the town or city, she is not wholly in sympathy with country ways. It frequently happens that those who do not have adequate accommodations are the ones who see the necessity and extend hospitality. This difficulty will be overcome by the teacher's cottage, but it will not come in a day, nor can it become common in single-teacher schools. for it would be a lonely life and not at all desirable with our teaching force as it is now in the country. In order to make the teacher's cottage feasible and practicable at least three teachers should be brought to - gether. This will bring added advantage to the school and make the teacher's cottage a practical institution. The newer idea of the tract of land containing from six to ten acres with residence thereon requires a man who can put the tract to use, either for his own support or for agricultural demonstration. A man of family would be essential and the wife could often find employment in the school. This plan makes it possible and wholly practicable to keep a cow, some pigs and chickens and to raise a garden. This will effect considerable saving from the salary. There are several advantages accruing from the teacher's resi - dence. A caretaker is on the ground during the summer months, making it possible to grow shrubbery and trees, rendering the premises more attractive. The idea is taking hold in Nebraska. Scottsbluff County established three teacher's cottages last year. Nine cottages are now in use in Nebraska and five or six other districts are accumulating funds for the purpose of building. The idea while new to us is of many generations' standing in other countries. It may well be fostered in our state as a permanent method of school advancement.

            <seg id="p032">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 32 THE PREPARATION OF OUR TEACHERS AND TENURE OF SERVICE It is interesting to note that so far as academic qualifications are concerned Nebraska teachers take high rank. The real deficiency oc- curs in the lack of ripe experience. Since most of our teachers are ladies perhaps we should not expect them to give longer service in the schoolroom when more attractive inducements are offered them. Out of the 12,643 teachers in the state only about 1506 are men. There is a lack, however, of specific preparation for country teaching. Our teacher- training agencies such as normal training high schools, normal schools, the university and in some instances our denominational schools are struggling with this phase of teacher-training. The country people themselves feel that the boys ana girls of the country who return to them to teach have a decided advantage over the city bred teacher. A teacher should know intimately the life of the people among whom she labors and should be in sympathy with those she serves. Mr. W. H. Campbell of the Educational Committee of the Farmers' Union has long cherished a hope that some day provision may be made for training country teachers amid country environment. This is an ideal which no state in the Union has approached. A few weeks ago we sent out blanks, through the county superin- tendents, to the teachers employed in schools organized under Articles III and VI. We have reports from 4,632 including no city teachers and representing sixty-nine counties. The summary is as follows: Preparation: 1 year of high school 235 2 years* of high school 634 3 years of high school 597 4 years of high school 2,871 Those showing no high school but some special work in normal schools, private and state 295 Normal or College Preparation: It will be observed that 3,810 of the 4.632 have from one to four years of college education in addition to four years of high school pre- paration. 2,317 are graduates of normal training high schools. Teaching Experience: 1 to 3 years 2,919 4 to 6 years 863 7 to 10 years 421 More than 10 years 337 Not reporting experience 92 :ss than one year 614 587 year years yeans years - 152 238 </seg>
            <seg id="p033">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 33 The average experience of teachers throughout the country is less than three years which means that from 3,000 to 4,000 teachers are required for Nebraska schools each year. The lack of adequate remuneration, coupled with the instability of the teacher's position, militate against the schools. There is no question in the writer's mind that a satisfactory method could be devised for placing teachers who have made full preparation under civil service rules and that such a movement would be vastly beneficial not only to the profession but to the schools as well. Qualifications of those reporting; City state — First grade certificates 72 Second grade certificates - 34 Professional certificates 82 We have no data at hand for comparing Nebraska teachers so far as preparation is concerned with those of other states, but we are satisfied that our teachers would make a creditable showing by such comparison. TEACHERS INSTITUTES Practically ever since the state was organized county superintendents have held teachers' institutes during the summer months. These insti - tutes have taken uniform trend in management and in instruction. At first a period of two weeks was given to the session, but a few years ago this was reduced in practically all instances to one week. Instruction is given in the certificate subjects, supplemented by some methods, management and pedagogy. It would seem at the present time with four state normal schools, with nearly two hundred normal training high schools, 12 private schools and denominational colleges and the University of Nebraska, that there is little excuse for a person who is preparing to teach to need the acade - mic instruction in the summer institute. The teachers' institute should under modern conditions assume a different form; it should be the county superintendent's period for developing team work among his teachers; for instructing teachers in programs, courses of study, special professional courses, reports, records and other matters pertaining to the good of the profession.

The summer institute held in the hot weather calls teachers back from summer vacations and summer employment and causes an outlay of from $10 to $15 in expense of attending. About the only feature of advantage with the old form holds is that it furnishes summer jobs for institute instructors who otherwise might find a long summer vacation burdensome. I am not sure, however, that we have any obligation in this direction. A two' days' session held at week-ends during September, October, November or December would seem to be sufficient time and would pro - duce better results; besides it would save the teachers of the state ap - proximately $100,000 per annum. These institutes could be held Friday and Saturday, one day on the district's time and one day on the teacher's time, thus dividing the burden. Moreover these sessions would be held at the most advantageous time and would secure the highest results from the fact that teachers would go back into their schoolrooms with a higher appreciation of their responsibilities and the spirit of enthusiasm en - gendered by their contact with each other and instruction given. During the last two years a trial institute has been operated by County Superintendent A. T. Holtzen of Thayer County. It is his testi - mony, as well as the testimony of the teachers and the boards of educa - tion, that the plan is beneficial and that the change would be wholesome to the educational interests of the county. SHORT WINTER COURSES IN SCHOOLS At a safe estimate there are from 30,000 to 35,000 young people in rural districts who have either passed or outgrown the eighth grade who have never been in high school and perhaps never will be. Many of these young people work in the household and on the farm during the active working season. If it were possible to enter school when corn husking is over and pursue definite lines of study until the spring work begins, a large number would do so and would be greatly benefited there - by. The fact that our school year is divided into semesters rather than terms makes it difficult to arrange satisfactory programs. Provision should be made for courses of study covering reviews, ad - vanced studies and vocational subjects for at least two months in all districts wherein ten pupils or more can be gotten together who will take advantage of the opportunity. If single districts could not pro - vide such instruction then groups of districts could cooperate to this end. This arrangement would necessitate a special teacher. It would necessitate an additional room in the schoolhouse, but this can be pro - vided. In many communities there are young people who have taken advanced studies in the State Agricultural College or in the State Normals and who are engaged during most of the year in agricultural pursuits who could be employed to teach these schools. This supply </seg>
            <seg id="p035">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION could be supplemented by students from the Agricultural Collere and from the Normal Schools who could make up their term deficiencies ia summer sessions. Such an arrangement would be of incalculable good to the state. In order to succeed against competition in many lines, systems of market - ing and advanced agricultural methods, our fathers need better preparation than the eighth grade affords. The short winter course would offer profitable employment for the winter month* for thousands of our young people who otherwise would find it necessary to go through life with no more than an eighth grade education. The state could well afford to foster such a program by reasonable financial aid. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION Urban universities are now advocating courses of study for the training of policemen. The days when size and courage and the ability to shoot straight were the chief qualifications are rapidly hastening rearward. As the open saloon as an institution is driven into closer quarters the yegg and the gunman will in large measure follow it and the policeman will find that his job entails new duties. He must now assist with the administration of the laws, community sanitation and the scientific principles thereof, engineering and mechanics, all of which require a fundamental technical education. Training along special lines is essential to progress. In a state like ours whose basic industry ia agriculture industrial subjects founded upon the basic life of the state should be emphasized and programs of study should find vitality therein. Although some progress has been made with this phase of education in Nebraska, we have not advanced far. The great war now in progress is emphasizing the need of industrial preparation and Congress will no doubt soon pass the Smith-Hughes bill providing for federal aid for vocational education and for the preparation for teachers for vocational subjects. Section 2 of the Smith-Hughes bill already passed the Senate pro - vides for an appropriation of $500,000 for. 1917; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1918, the sum of $750,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919, the sum of $1,000,000; for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1920, the sum of $1,250,000; for the fiscal year ending June .30, 1921, the sum of $1,500,000. In 1925 and annually thereafter the appropriation will reach $3,000,000, said sum shall be allotted to the state, in the proportion which their rural population bears to the total rural population of the United States, not including outlying possessions according to the last preceding United States census. It is a mistaken idea that the farmer does not need an education. The fact is he needs it more than those who are engaged in many other lines; he must be an architect and a builder; he must know soils and soil </seg>

Nebraska must accept the challenge of the times. Our great pro- gress in education must be in vocational fields. In most of our high schools are found commercial courses, agricultural instruction and train- ing in manual and household arts, but definite constructive programs are yet to be wrought out in order to bring the state into the full benefit of such training. Four years ago the legislature made an appropriation under the Shumway law of $15,000 as a beginning to encourage vocational educa- tion in the high schools of the state. Two years ago the fund was doubled, but this would not reach far with the many high schools of the state. We give herewith a list of the schools approved and, accepting the school year beginning 1914 and closing 1915 as typical, we give data founded thereon: VOCATIONAL HIGH SCHOOLS 1914-1915 * _£ _ . 1 -5-U e •*- ■s. £ SCHOOL u U U 4 *!* 5 5 ■§« -gas ■§« |-| |&gt;£ O'Neill 52 43 $ 450 $2000 Red CIoihLZZZ.

SOME RESULTS The fact that we are spending vast sums of money in the educa- tion of the rising generation, coupled with the fact that the country school grows smaller year by year, made it seem necessary to under- take a campaign of school improvement in order that the interest of the commonwealth might be conserved. Therefore early in our term in 1915 we called together a number of advisers from the country districts and outlined a program of school extension which seemed most capable of remedying the defects and of bringing to the people the highest degree of efficiency. From investigations made we found more than half our rural schools operating with from one to twelve children and that the coat of maintaining one of these small schools so far as over-head expense* are concerned was practically the same as the cost of maintaining a school with the full quota of children. We found also that the small school </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 38 is usually the most inefficient, giving no opportunity for child life to socialize itself, no incentive for teachers to prepare their daily work, no friendly contentions or rivalries for pupils in these schools. We found that the people themselves were seeking means of improving these con - ditions and further that they were especially interested in improving their own social conditions and that they were fully alive to the necessity of maintaining a high standard of people upon the farms of the state.

MIhk I'earl Sherlock, principal, is a graduate of the higher courw of the State Normal School. The fact that conditions vary in different parts of the state made it necessary to diversify the program in order to meet these conditions and to give the people the option of methods of school improvement proposed. , First — In the most sparsely settled portions of the state the single - teacher school will be a necessity perhaps for many years, under which condition the schools should be standardized and brought up to the highest possible efficiency. The scheme of standardization is found in the report of Assistant A. V. Teed in this volume. Second — In the more populous sections where the districts are smaller the cooperative (consolidated district) could be used to advantage. By combining several schools the cost of operation could be materially re - duced and the efficiency increased. Third — In some localities where the cooperative district did not seem calculated to solve the problem and where there was a need of high school instruction, the over-head high school could be established. From two to four districts could unite and establish a hi?h school carrying ninth and tenth erodes in a school centrally located. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 39 By means of these three suggestions it was hoped to bring relief to the country districts. The people were asked to meet in their home districts, inquire into their local school conditions, discuss the question of school improvement and to decide upon which method seemed best calculated to solve the problem of their particular district. Great activity resulted. The state superintendent and his assistant were sub - ject to the call of the people and went wherever they could be of service. As a result a splendid spirit grew up and many schools of high merit are now established and stand as an example of what may be done. Consolidate*! school at asrott.

The people of the rural districts seem concerned not only in im - proving the instruction in the grades, but in bringing some high school instruction within easy reach of the home. About 8,000 young people complete the work of the country schools each year and reports reveal that at a very reasonabl estimate there are over 30,000 young people now living in rural communities who are ready for high school, but who have never been able to attend and perhaps never will be unless the high school is brought within reach of the home. The Over-Head High School A number of schools known as over-head high schools have been established in the last two years.

This is the most ex - pensive method of school improvement, as it forms a dual system, but it has brought relief in many intances. Such high schools as Lowell in Kearney County and Riverside in Burt County have rendered excellent service. The Single District Rural High The rural high school in the single district has proven popular where the district has sufficient area and valuation to support the same without excessive taxation. Many districts have installed ninth and tenth grades with two or three teachers on a levy of from fourteen to twenty mills. These schools employ well prepared teachers, are well equipped and form centers for community life. One of the first of these was formed in District No. 82 of Saunders County through the efforts of Mr. Charles Davis and his neighbors.

When this building was dedicated in December a large number of Hartington citizens were present to participate in the exercises. The program consisted of com - munity music and a comedy drama staged by the people of the district.

A candidate for a county certificate applies to the county superintendent for a number upon which to take the examinations. All of the candidate's examination papers are num- bered and sent into the state superintendent's office. The name does not appear and the examiner does not know whose paper he examines. For this number the candidate pays $1.50; fifty cents is forwarded to the state superintendent and one dollar goes to the county superintendent as a certificate fee and covers the entire expense to the candidate. The fifty cents covers the cost of printing questions, postage, express, and the examination of all manuscripts, including the entire eighteen subjects required for county certificates, recording and certifying to county superintendents. Candidates for city state certificates pay a fee of $1.00 which covers examinations and professional certificate. Candidates for general life certificates pay the same fee covering examination and certificate. The legislature of 1915 in reducing the appropriations for the main- tenance of the department made provision for the use of the cash fund to relieve any distress which might accrue from a lack of sufficient appropriations. </seg>

            <seg id="p052">52 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . DIVISION OF BUBAL SCHOOLS A. V. Teed, Assistant Superintendent The past two years stand out as a period of great progress in rural schools. Every resource of the department of education has been brought to bear upon this most vital of all school problems. State Superintendent Thomas and the writer have given .practically all their time to the cam - paign for equal educational opportunities for the farm boys and girls. The work has developed along four distinct lines, the training of teachers in the state normal schools and normal training high schools for rural service; the establishment of standards for the measurement of rural schools; the development of a system of rural high schools; and the build - ing of stronger schools through consolidation. STANDARDIZATION From -Nebraska Educational Bulletin on Rural School Standards "For the purpose of establishing definite standards which will be con - ducive to greater care in providing educational facilities for rural children and also for the purpose of setting forth practical ideals this bulletin is prepared. With its wealth and its opportunity there is no legitimate reason why the children of the rural place should not be the most fortunate in the land. With their out-of-door life and rural activity, with brain and brawn the children of the farm should be vigorous and strong physically, intellectually and morally. They should be so vigorous that even the shorter school year of the rural school should afford as fair ah advance as the longer year of town and city schools with frequent interruptions and with the less active habits of the children. We are in the midst of a state wide effort to improve our schools. Our people of the farms want their children to have as good opportunities as are afforded the children of the cities. For a period of years we have enjoyed prosperity. The hardships of pioneer life are over. Investments are made. Improved machinery and modern homes have come. We have been busy with these substantial improvments in material things and have seemingly neg - lected to pay due attention to our rural school system. Let us make an effort, teachers, parents and children, to improve our schools and make them the best in the land. This is the children's age. We believe in our schools. We pay in taxes large sums ungrudgingly, willingly, for their support in order that the coming generation may be prepared to meet the exigencies of its age. In Nebraska we are spending $1,000,000 a month for public education, well knowing that none of this vast sum will return in dollars and cents to those who give, but it is our legacy to the future generation, and we are triad for this means of service. Let us not only make our schools strong </seg>
            <seg id="p053">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 53 and efficient in the instruction we provide, but let us make them attrac - tive to the children, a pride to the community and a strength to future generations. Next to the home the school should be the pleasantest place in the community. In order to provide tangible measurements for rural schools the fol - lowing standards are suggested and the cooperation of school people and patrons is solicited in order to make them a means of service to the state. When a school reaches the minimum requirements it should be re - ported to the state department of public instruction through the county superintendent. If the report is favorable, an assistant from the depart - ment will be sent to investigate and to verify the measurements. All schools receiving favorable report shall be placed in the published list of "standard" schools and a certificate of standardization suitable for fram - ing will be forwarded to the school. A standard school must score one hundred points, including the minimum requirements, out of a possible one hundred twenty-five. A school reaching one hundred fifteen points will be placed among the schools of "merit." MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS 1. Term must be at least eight months. 2. Teacher must hold a second grade certificate or better, with at least 24 weeks normal training or at least two years successful experience. 3. Salary of the teacher must be at least fifty-five dollars per month. 4. School grounds, buildings and outbuildings must be adequate, clean and sanitary. 5. Schoolroom must be lighted from the left or the left and rear of the pupils, with the window area at least 20% of floor area. 6. Schoolroom must have a heating and ventilating system of some approved type — at least 200 cubic feet of air space for each pupil. 7. Seats must be individual, adapted to the size of the children and properly adjusted. 8. Outbuildings must be separate, at least fifty feet apart, clean and sanitary. 9. School must have plenty of text-books, supplementary readers and desk dictionaries. 10. Reference library including dictionary. 11. School must be well organized and the teaching efficient. 12. School must have globe, maps and plenty of blackboard. </seg>

Painting. The preservative power of paint makes it a real econ- omy, to say nothing of the added attractiveness. Since the cost is no greater, the same taste should be used in painting a schoolhouse that we should use in painting a home. Interior walls should be papered or tinted. If the plastering is in bad condition, paper is the only remedy. New walls should be left rough and tinted. Where there is an abundance of light, olive side walls with </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT cream ceilings make a pleasing combination. Considering the effect of colors on lighting, light green or light gray for walls and white or cream for ceiling will give best results. 2. Lighting. The light should come from the left or the left and rear of the pupils. The entire window area should equal one-fifth of the floor area. The main source of light should be from the north or east. The north light is easier upon the eyes but when this light is used win - dows should be provided to admit sunlight into the school room from the east or west for sanitary reasons. These windows should be half windows in the back of the room and the sills should be about seven feet from the floor. They should be easily opened for ventilation, and provided with good shades. The schoolroom should never be lighted by windows on opposite sides of the room, nor should pupils or teacher sit facing a window. 3. Heating and Ventilating. Building should provide 15 sq. ft. of floor space and 200 cu. ft. of air space for each pupil. Heating should be by jacketed stove, room heater or furnace. The bare stove takes up too much floor space, roasts those near it and permits those to freeze who are farther away. The floors are always cold, and ventilation is impossible. The basement furnace is ideal if properly installed, but very danger - ous if it returns the foui air to the furnace to be re-heated and returned to the room. Such a system should take fresh air from outside and must have a foul air flue. Probably the most satisfactory system for a single room school is one of the many patented room heaters with ventilating attachments. These are very satisfactory, but they must be properly installed and have a chimney at least 12x12 inches in the clear on the inside. County superin - tendents should instruct teachers regarding the operation of these plants. Full information may be had from the company which manufactures the plant. 4. Floors. All floors should be of hard wood, well matched and smoothed. Floors should have an occasional coat of oil, and should be swept with a sweeping compound. Dust is a great germ carrier and a menace to the health of pupils and teacher. EQUIPMENT 1. Seating. Fully fifty per cent of our school children are being in - jured by sitting six hours each day in positive discomfort due to improper adjustment of desks. A schoolroom should be seated with single adjust - able desks. If the old desks are too good to discard, they should be re - arranged with desks of the same size in a row, never permitting the "step - ladder" arrangement whereby a pupil sits on a high seat and bends over a low desk. Most desks are too far apart, requiring a pupil to sit on the </seg>
            <seg id="p057">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 57 front of the seat and reach for the desk. The back of the desk should ex - tend about two inches over the front of the seat. Under no conditions should a pupil sit where his feet do not reach the floor. Nearly every school house needs more desks for the small pupils. If in doubt regard - ing the site of desks needed, consult your county superintendent or this department. 2. Water. Growing children need a great deal of water. If the wa - ter supply is not properly safeguarded, children risk their health every day. The uleal system would include a good well or cistern with pres - sure tank and a drinking fountain. With such a water supply, the school could also have indoor closets. Where the school does not have a well or cistern, the board should ar - range to have water carried or hauled from a neighboring house. The water should be stored in a large stone jar with faucet or in a sanitary drinking fountain. If the jar is used, pupils should have individual drinking cups. No surer method for the spread of disease can be con - ceived than the open water pail and common cup. 3. Library. The library should be a district library available for any resident of the district. If but a few books may be had, they should be selected for a working reference library for the school. This should in - clude a large dictionary and a five or six volume encyclopedia. Such an encyclopedia may be purchased direct for about half the price asked by agents. When ordering new books, do not forget the primary pupils and beware of worthless fiction. A simple system of recording and charging these library books, when taken from the schoolhouse, should be supplied in every county. New books should be added once or twice each year or pupils and patrons will lose interest in the library. If you are in doubt about the selection of books, consult the state library commission, your county superintendent, or this department. 4. Miscellaneous Equipment. It is almost impossible to get too much blackboard, and at least a part of it should be within reach of the pri - mary pupils. Slate makes the best blackboard, but where the cost is prohibitive a composition board will give good service for a number of years. Book cases should be built in, if possible. Otherwise sectional cases are most convenient. Better one good picture well framed and properly placed than a multitude of cheap prints. Wash basin, mirror and individual towels should be provided by the district and used by the pupils. Grounds and Outbuildings 1. Grounds. Every school ground should be fenced in order that grass and trees may be protected. The most satisfactory fence is made of gas pipe running through heavy posts. It thus provides a fence that is practically indestructible and it may also be used as a hitching rack. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT If possible, the front of the school grounds should be given over to lawn. The side and rear of the grounds should be planted with trees leaving: plenty of room for play. 2. Outbuildings. Where a district can meet the expense inside clos - ets should be provided. Where this is not possible, separate closets should be provided at least fifty feet apart. They should be sand-painted to discourage whittling and marking and should be kept clean at all times. The teacher should lock them when school closes and unlock them in the morning, thus providing for inspection twice a day. These buildings should be absolutely free from marks of any kind. The Teacher If good teachers are essential in town schools, even more so are they in the rural schools for they must solve most of their problems without assistance from supervisors and are always crowded for time. The ideal rural teacher must understand country conditions and be able to live in the country. For this reason teachers who have been raised in the country are to be preferred. blf your teacher is properly interested in her work, she will take hers' magazines and attend teachers' meetings and institutes. In tion she must make some preparation for each days' work. Organization. No school can be efficient that is not thoroughly organized. The rural teacher has so many classes that a well arranged program is an absolute necessity. School boards and parents must give their ap - proval to a reasonable combination of classes or hire more teachers. The teacher should follow the course of study as nearly as the text books in use will permit. Quarterly examinations should be given and reports sent to parents. The register should be kept as carefully as a merchant keeps his books. Results Though the school plant be perfect and the teacher efficient, the school is a failure unless the attendance is regular and the pupils com - plete the course. School authorities should see that all pupils are regular in their attendance at school. Country Life Agencies If we are to hold boys and girls in the country we must make the country school and country life more attractive. Every one of the agencies listed in the score card has been tried in schools, and has proved a success. Practically any meeting that gets the people of the district together in the name of the school, is worth while. To better school conditions, we must bring parents to see conditions as they actually exist and compare them with the ideal. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 59 SANITATION Ten Sanitary Commandments for Rural Schools DR. THOMAS D. WOOD, Chairman of the Committee on Health Problems of the National Council of Education In every school which may be considered passably sanitary the fol - lowing conditions shall obtain: 1. Heating: by at least a properly jacketed stove. (No unjacketed stove to be allowed.) Avoid overheating. Temperature should never go above 70 degrees F. Ventilation by direct outdoor air inlets and by adequate and direct foul air outlets. 2. Lighting from left side of room (or from left and rear) through window space at least one-fifth of floor space in area. 3. Cleanliness of school as good as in the home of a careful house - keeper. 4. Furniture sanitary in kind, and easily and frequently cleaned. Seats and desks adjustable and hygienic in type. 5. Drinking water from a pure source provided by a sanitary drink - ing fountain. 6. Facilities for washing hands, and individual towels. 7. Toilets and privirs sanitary in type and in care (with no cess - pools unless water tight) and no neglected privy boxes or vaults. 8. Flies and mosquitoes excluded by thorough screening of school - house and toilets. 9. Obscene and defacing marks absolutely absent from schoolhouse and privies. 10. Playground of adequate size for every rural school. HOW TO SECURE A STANDARD SCHOOL 1. People must be made to realize present conditions. (a) Get them to the schoolhouse by having a program, school fair, patrons' day or eighth grade commencement exer - cise. Serve lunch or dinner if possible. (b) Organize a School Improvement Club. 2. Present the case to the school board. 3. Turn out to the annual meeting and see that funds are provided. The annual meeting is changed by act of the legislature to the sec - ond Monday in June; patrons should attend the meeting and direct school matters in a fair, frank manner, and endeavor to provide for the </seg>

(b) Consult the county superintendent regarding her record and certificate. &lt;c) Offer sufficient salary to get the best. - (d) Retain the same teacher as long as possible. (e) Co-operate with the teacher in every way. (1) See that she has a good boarding place. (2) Make her feel at home in the district. (3) Let her know that she will have your support in her work. Teacher and parent must cooperate, they are co-workers and should be friends. (4) Visit the school". On account of the high standards established, it will take time to produce any great number of these schools. Many schools could meet all the requirements except the one regarding lighting. Other require- ments frequently lacking are salary, ventilation and proper outbuild- ings. Several county superintendents have reported schools which we have not been able to inspect on account of othei work. To date more than one hundred schools have been inspected, of which 35 have been approved with total scores as follows: MERIT SCHOOLS ocorp District No. 38— Fillmore County 118 District No. 6 — Washington County 116 District No. 5 — (Avery) Sarpy County 116 STANDARD SCHOOLS District No. 22— Pierce County 101 District No. 1— Sarpy County 104 District No. 5 — Platte County 101 District No. 10 — Sherman County — _ 105 District No. 14 — Adams County 104 District No. 31 — Adams County 103 District No. 13— Douglas County - 102 District No. 41 — Douglas County 100 District No. 46— Douglas County :. 101 District No. 49 — Douglas County 105 District No. 61— Douglas County _ 108 District No. 10 — Wayne County 101 District No. 46— Clay County 106 </seg>

            <seg id="p062">62 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT RURAL HIGH SCHOOLS The growing demand for secondary eduation in the rural communities has given great impetus to the establishment of rural high schools. Many districts have been able to provide the building, equipment and extra teaching force out of their own resources. Others have in the spirit of co-operation united with neighboring districts as provided in Article VII of the School Law. Most of these schools have modern buildings, well equipped for ag - riculture, manual training and domestic science, as well as the standard subjects. The teachers are usually well prepared and have a vision of rural service. The strongest argument for this type of school is the fact that the addition of high school grades makes the school a more dignified in - stitution which attracts pupils, renders community service and receives adequate financial support. Washington County has nine such schools following a uniform course of study with uniform texts and equipment. Burt County has six rural high schools, and each of the following counties has one or more: — Boyd, Buffalo, Cedar, Cherry, Cheyenne, Cuming, Custer, Dawson, Dixon, Dodge, Franklin, Gage, Greeley, Hall, Hayes, Holt, Kearney, Keith, Lincoln, Madison, Merrick, Nance, Phelps, Pierce, Platte, Saunders, Scottsbluff. Sheridan, Sherman, Sioux, Webster, York, Howard, Sarpy. The case of the rural high school is so well presented in a bulletin issued by this department, that we reproduce portions as follows: — HOME AND SCHOOL From Nebraska Educational Bulletin on Approved High Schools These two institutions are vital elements in our democracy; where one is found there the other should be also. The parent and the teacher are striving not against each other but together for the same earnest cause, the ideal of useful manhood and womanhood in a free govern - ment where the people are themselves supreme. Parent and teacher should be true friends, understanding each other, earnest and frank in all their associations, in all they do and say affecting one another. Home and school should be the pleasantest and most attractive places in the community for about them cluster the noblest influences of life. The effort and the effect of the two should be to make home life more effi - cient in bringing happiness and high ideals to the family. I know of no better means of accomplishing this end than to extend the home period of the youth. Under the present-day system a country youth who seeks an education finds his real home life cut off at an early age. The average </seg>

Soon after he se - cures his promotion from the eighth grade he says "Father I wish I could go to high school". Father and mother hold a conference. They know that those who are equipped with the right sort of an education have the better chance, and after planning and figuring for days and perhaps weeks, they are decided. The boy's wish becomes the law of the household. When the time arrives for the opening of the fall term of the high school, the small bundle is prepared and the youth sets out upon his journey. He finds it necessary to board in town and can get home only at week ends, but he grows ac - customed to it and father and mother submit to what seems to them the inevitable. The lad is 18 when he is ready for college, he has become aware of the still greater advantages accruing from a higher course, and the parents again consent. The visits home are less frequent, the boy is but a visitor as he returns at term-ends. Gradually the two elements of the home drift apart. When college days are over, the young man enters business or takes up his profession, not on the farm and at home but among strangers. The home life is inevitably shortened, the boy loses the home and its insubstitutional influence just when he can least afford it, while the home loses the boy life. No wonder the home would permit the boy to neglect his education rather than to make the greater sacrifice. And this condition is common in Nebraska. In a careful study of statistics we find that only about six out of every hundred children in the schools of our country will go beyond the eighth grade. This means that the burden of responsibility in society, in business and in government must rest upon the shoulders of a genera - tion largely without the benefits of secondary education. It is a known fact that the great mass of our people will not go long distances to school, either elementary, secondary or college, and the only sure way is to bring within reach of the home as much of the school as we desire to become common. In most parts of the state no legitimate reason hinders the project. THE NEEDS OF YOUNG LIFE Who will deny the child the inalienable right of association with his kind; it is his inheritance and should be well safeguarded. The independ - ence of the child and his need of the society of childhood are important factors in his ultimate ability to fit with proper nicety into his real sphere when he becomes a man. No wonder the average rural child becomes dis - couraged with his environment and longs for the time to come when he can break his prison walls for freedom. In the small, rural school, there is little opportunity for the development of the child's interests — tho«e things which form the world in which he should live. There are not sum- </seg>

Small numbers preclude choice of agreeable companions, preclude the organization of a ball team; teams for stock -judging, spelling squads, excursions, fishing parties and a world of child interests are sorely want - ing. By bringing together larger groups as is possible and wholly prac - ticable under the proposed new conditions, these added facilities for youth development bring greater contentment and prepare the young for their best service. Youth life, school spirit, community interest and home it - self are prompted by this movement and the cry of "back to the farm" dies away as the need of it ceases to exist. HOW TO COUNT THE COST "But", you say, "it will cost so much!" Are not the home and the child worth it? Yes, when we study the situation carefully and from close range, we discover that the cry of increased cost is not warranted and most communities would be able to provide the full twelve grades for what the eight now cost. The larger area and the joining of forces will reduce the outlay and increase the efficiency. Here are some figures. bThe following exhibits the existing conditions in three adjoining dis - ts in one of Nebraska's prosperous counties showing the cost of an ith grade education. The three districts may be consolidated and the building so placed that few of the pupils will have farther to go under the new conditions and a tenth grade education offered for much less than eight grades now cost. The efficiency may also be increased and the children who desire to extend their education remain longer at home. i i I « Teacher Repairs i Fuel Books Miscel- Furniture I laneous Total 29 .... $360.00 $21.30 495.00 $98.30 59.70 540.00 538.85 29.20 $1395.00 $637.15 $110.20 $2.35 1.70 27.75 $31.80, $7.75 $391.41 $125.00 3.40 783.11 220.42 1,356.2: $125.00 $231.57 $2,530.7: l </seg>

These districts propose to vote bonds for the erection of a school, and to build in such a manner that later they may consolidate for general school purposes and add to the building such room as may be necessary. ACCREDITMENT Schools are accredited by the University of Nebraska. The purpose of such accreditment is to provide such standards as will assure instruc - tion of such strength that the pupils who complete the course of study in these schools are enabled to carry the work of the university, should they seek to do so, with ease and with assurance of proper progress. Pupils who graduate from accredited schools in the state are admitted to the colleges of the state and to the University of Nebraska without examina - tion. For full entrance to the University thirty units or credits ( a credit point means one study with 5 recitation periods a week for half a yean should be required for graduation, science should be taught with ade - quate laboratory facilities, a well equipped library and recitation periods of at least forty minutes in length should be provided. In addition to a Cperintendent (or principal) there should be at least two teachers giving II time to secondary subjects. The minimum academic or professional preparation of teachers should be equivalent to a four-year course in col - lege or university based upon a four-year high school education. There should not be more than six daily recitations assigned to each teacher. APPROVED SCHOOLS The approval of schools is a function of the State Department of Education. All schools accredited by the University of Nebraska are r.pproved by the state superintendent. There is however, a large number of schools surrounded by conditions which do not make it practicable to comply with all of the requirements for accreditment. Many of such schools are unable to carry a full program of studies and must be content with nine, ten or eleven grades and with less substantial facili - ties for executing the program. It is thought best by the department, in justice to the children who live in such districts, to apply such effec - tive standards as may reasonably be met and which may be conducive to the educational progress of the youth of the state. Pupils who complete the work of an approved school may receive credit for such work by the University when subsequent work in such studies is carried in accredited schools. For example, if a student carries a year of algebra in a non-accredited but approved school and later carries an advanced course in this subject in some accredited school, full credit for the subject is granted upon the completion of the course of study in an accredited </seg>
            <seg id="p067">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 67 The ultimate purpose of establishing standards for the approval of schools carrying high school courses is to develop a complete system of education which will connect properly with the courses in higher institu - tions of learning and afford every ambitious child an open door to the most efficient preparation and to a well-rounded education, while the immediate use is to provide a means of designating schools in compli - ance with the Free High School Education Act; unless boards of education comply with these standards they are not allowed to collect tuition from other districts for non-residents, nor are they able to escape the provisions of the law which compel districts which do not provide high school education to pay the tuition of those who have completed the eighth grade and seek to pursue their studies in other schools. Merely establishing a ninth and tenthgrade and requiring one teacher to perform the impossible will not suffice There is a further reason for such approval and that is, to enable schools to profit by state aid.

Where schools employ two teachers for three years of high school work, a part of the time may be devoted to grade work, but the high school classes must have full time. e. Rural schools employing but two teachers should follow the course of study as given on page 22 of the bulletin on "Approved High Schools". RECOMMENDED COURSES OF STUDY Last year a few one-teacher schools where half or more of the grades were missing taught all or a part of the ninth grade. Where such work can be done without sacrificing the interests of the smaller children, it meets with our entire approval. However, the conditions in these schools call for a closer supervision than our funds will permit. For this reason, no one-teacher schools will be approved for high school work, but examinations will be provided whereby pupils in such schools may receive full credit for all work completed in a satisfactory manner. L These examinations will be given as directed by the county superin - ent and the papers graded under his supervision. To avoid offering questions in a multitude of subjects, we must ask that this ninth grade work be made fairly uniform throughout the state. To secure such uniformity, questions for each semester will be provided in the following subjects: First Semester Second Semester Algebra — Through fractions. English — The sentence, words, the Algebra — Through quadratrics. English — Forms of discourse, letter paragraph, figures of speech. Elementary Science. writing, grammar. Agriculture. Farm Accounting — Farm Arith - metic, Bookkeeping. Civics. If desired agriculture may be substituted for elementary science in the first semester and physical geography for agriculture in the second semester.

The State Super - intendent reserves the privilege of withholding approval until a repre - sentative of the Department has visited the school and personally in - spected it. In approving these schools the standard above given is the "yard stick" by which they are judged. These schools have developed so rapidly that it has been impossible for the Department, with limited assistance to inspect all such schools. County Superintendents usually reserve their approval until after they have visited the schools; as a con- sequence there are schools, both rural high schools and consolida - tions, not reported in this list. \ Besides this list there are many rural schools with limited number of pupils and some grades entirely lacking who find it possible to instruct in some high school subjects usually covering the ninth grade. Such schools are not reported in this list and are not approved as they do not meet the requirements necessary to conserve the integrity of the grades earned. However, provision is made for special examinations under the direction of the County Superintendent and through questions fur - nished by the State Department.

No other single legislative enactment has had, in my estima - tion, such a beneficial influence and has been so far reaching in its direct and immediate effect upon the rural schools of our state as the law authorizing normal training in the high schools. Less than ten years ago, our country schools were taught by teachers with practically no professional training and a large per cent of them had but little academic training, while today ninety per cent of our rural teachers have had the equivalent of a four - year academic course in accredited high schools with at least one - half year of professional training including psychology, school man - agement and practice teaching. Normal training high schools are now located in nearly every county in the state, which places within reach of every ambitious youth the possibility of professional training at little or no expense to himself. During the past year more than 6,450 teachers who had received their professional training in the normal training high schools of the state were giving instruction to 202,500 rural school children. That the normal training courses in our high schools are popu - lar and in great demand is shown by the fact that during the past nine years since normal training was introduced into our high school curriculum, 13,799 student teachers have selected this course and during the present school year out of the total enrollment of 8,514 students in the eleventh and twelfth grades in cur normal training schools, 4,374 have declared their intention to prepare for the pro - fession of teaching. When 51 per cent of all students enrolled in the upper two grades of our high schools select the normal training course in preference to all other courses offered, no further argu - ment is needed to prove the popularity of the course and the neces - sity of its continuation in our high schools. </seg>

            <seg id="p080">80 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 5. SUMMARY Nine counties have no normal training schools, employ 351 rural teachers, have no student-teachers. Twenty-nine counties have one normal training school, employ 1,652 rural teachers, have 481 student-teachers. Twenty-two counties have two normal training schools, employ 1,733 rural teachers, have 1,096 student-teachers. Thirteen counties have three normal training schools, employ 997 rural teachers, have 832 student-teachers. Fifteen counties have four normal training schools, employ 1,548 rural teachers, have 1,260 student-teachers. Three counties have five normal training schools, employ 297 rural teachers, have 413 student-teachers. Two counties have six normal training schools, employ 176 rural teachers, have 292 student-teachers. Ninety-three counties have twenty-one normal training schools, em - ploy 6,754 rural teachers, have 4,375 student-teachers. Analysis — Unequal distribution of normal training schools has caused over-production in thirty-three counties, while eight western counties without such schools find it necessary to annually import teachers from counties over-supplied. On the whole this practice has not been productive of good results as student-teachers raised and trained in eastern counties rarely adapt themselves to western environments. A more equal distribution of normal training schools based on the total number of rural teachers needed in a county and more lib - eral state aid for normal training in counties without a four-year high school would in a large measure remedy the problem of over - production in the densely settled communities of the east and middle west and guarantee an adequate supply of properly trained teachers in counties deprived of such. The Need of Higher Standards. Following a careful inspection of the normal training schools during the year 1915-16, a conference of city and county superintend - ents was called to discuss the advisability of a revision of the rules and regulations governing such schools. The following report of the inspector constituted the basis for such revision: First — Schools doing normal training work may be classified in three groups: (a) Schools which meet the legal minimum requirements but can not render efficient service for the want of proper equip - ment, general school facilities and necessary teaching: </seg>
            <seg id="p081">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION- 81 (b) Schools which have the facilities, equipment and teachers, but do not see the need of rendering more and better ser - vice than the law requires. (c) Schools which render real professional service in the train - ing of teachers. Second — Many schools now approved to give instruction in nor - mal training fail to properly SELECT and TRAIN student-teachers along professional lines. (a) One-third of the schools now approved as normal training schools offer no alternative in their course of study, the teacher's course being the only one which leads to gradua - tion. (b) Major and minor review subjects are taught chiefly to pre - pare candidates for examinations. (c) Much of the so-called practice teaching has little real value. A few lessons on observation, a little cadeting or an oc - casional day at substituting falls far short from furnish - ing teaching experience and training in school organiza - tion. (d) In many schools the normal training subjects are taught by teachers who have had little or no special training in the subjects they teach and oftimes have had no previous ex - perience in teaching. Third — Recommendations : (a) Extending the time of the major reviews to twelve weeks each and the minor reviews to six weeks each. (b) Eighteen weeks devoted to pedagogy exclusive of practice teaching. (c) Eighteen weeks devoted to the study of social center work, rural economics and at least twenty-four consecutive days given to observation and practice teaching in a four grade room organized as a model rural demonstration school. (d) At least three semesters' work in industrial training includ - ing manual training, home economics and agriculture. (e) That teachers employed to teach the professional normal training subjects must have at least one year's experience in a rural school. rAn annual study and round table conference under the direc - tion of the state department with county, city superin - tendent, and No™*! Training teachers. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 82 (g) In order to keep in closer touch with rural school conditions and to render timely assistance to graduates from normal training high schools engaged in their first year's teaching. I would recommend the follow-up system — the normal training: teacher be given one day a month for rural school visitation as directed by the county superintendent. In compliance with a request from the conference State Superintend - ent A. O. Thomas appointed a committee to recommend to the depart - ment such changes in the rules and regulations governing normal train - ing schools as would remedy existing defects and improve the service in our schools. The following persons were appointed on the committee : LR. D. Moritz, normal training inspector, chairman; Superintendent H. Waterhouse, Fremont; Superintendent L. H. Henderson, Ains worth; Superintendent S. E. Clark, Hebron; Superintendent L. E. Chadderdon, Oxford; Superintendent P. M. Whitehead, Red Cloud. REVISION OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING NORMAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOLS TO BE IN EFFECT ON AND AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 1916 From Nebraska Educational Bulletin on Normal Training L Rules and Regulations Governing Normal Training Schools for the Year 1916 and 1917 U( Where necessary one year will be given for schools to adjust them ves to these regulations.) 1. Governing high school teachers, (a) Must be graduates of a four year college or university of ap - proved standing, the higher course of state normal schools f authorized by law to issue certificates, or hold life certificates earned on examination with such additional qualifications as are required for city state certificates. (b) Teachers of normal training subjects must have at least two years' successful experience (one year of which should be in [a country school), and one year of special professional study including principles of education, methods, observation and practice in a department of education of a normal school, col - lege or university approved for such work. One year of ad - ditional teaching may be substituted in lieu of the above professional requirements. 2. Governing grade teachers. («) Must hold first grade county certificates or second grade city </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 83 (b) Must have two years' experience in teaching, or must hmve practice teaching such as is required for graduates from the higher course of normal schools. 3. Course of study. (a) Shall consist of a regular four-year course as outlined by the bulletin issued jointly by the State Superintendent and the University of Nebraska unless the same shall be modified by the State Superintendent under the provisions of the law. In addition to the above course of study, normal training subjects shall be offered as electives, — one major and one minor review shall constitute a semester's work. The fol - lowing combinations are suggested: Arithmetic — 12 weeks followed by physiology — 6 weeks. Geography — 12 weeks followed by bookkeeping — 6 weeks. Grammar — 12 weeks followed by drawing and penmanship — 6 weeks. Reading — 12 weeks followed by practice teaching — 6 weeks. Pedagogy — 18 weeks. (b) As a means of guaranteeing suitable opportunities for gaining greater proficiency in spelling and mental arithmetic, it is recommended that at least thirty minutes per week be de - voted to these subjects for the entire school either at con - vocation or special period set aside for such purpose. (c) In order to keep in closer touch with rural school conditions and to render timely assistance to normal training graduates engaged in their first year of teaching, when it can be con - veniently arranged, at least one day each month should be set aside for the normal training instructor to do field work. (d) A knowledge of music, vocal and instrumental, is of inestima - ble value to the teacher, and if possible some arrangement should be made for instruction in this subject. 4. Standards of efficiency. (a) Schools approved for normal training must meet the general B requirements for equipment, sanitation and efficiency as may be considered essential by the state superintendent of public instruction. (b) The ideal class or group is estimated at 30 to 40 pupils. Un - der extraordinary and temporary circumstances a larger en - rollment may become necessary. Under no circumstances, however, should a school seek approval if the group exceeds 50 in number. (c) No school employing less than four high school teachers may be approved as a normal training school. School Law Art. X, Sec. 139. — Any county not having a high school ■which can qualify under this requirement, the state superintendent may designate a school of lower grade for giving normal training. </seg>

Conclusion: So general has been the demand on the part of our city superintendents for greater academic requirements and more and better professional training that with few exceptions the new coarse of study is now in operation in every school (the exceptions are those who have asked an extension of time till 1917 to adjust themselves to the new requirements). With the beginning of the new school year every Normal Training school will conform to the new requirements and we trust that in the future normal training will be synonymous with professional training in fact as well as in name. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT REPORT OF EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT NEBRASKA STATE FAIR Lulu S. Wolford, Superintendent Educational Exhibits From small beginnings, the educational exhibit at the Nebraska State Fair has gTown to be one of its most interesting features. The growth of the exhibit during the past two years has been remarkable. Many departures have been made from the beaten path, and encourage - ment has been offered for new, original, practical and progressive feat - ures in the display. LThe Nebraska educational exhibit is the largest school exhibit wn at any State Fair. The 1916 exhibit occupied over 10,000 square feet of space and much of the work sent in could not be displayed on account of lack of room. kin order to encourage the preparation of good exhibits, the pre - m lists have been prepared early. This year each county was plied with the premium lists in October, thus the schools will have ample opportunity to prepare their exhibits during the school year. Through the kindness of the State Fair Board, the premium list is published early in the year in sufficient numbers to supply every school in the state with a copy. Many marked changes have been made in the premium list for 1917; among them may be noted an arrangement whereby schools of the same class compete with each other. City schools compete only with schools of their own class; the same is true of consolidated schools, standardized rural schools, rural schools not standardized, and town and village schools. This makes the competition absolutely fair. The practical phases of education are being especially stressed. Under the manual training class, for instance, premiums are offered on substantial articles, such as Morris chairs, library tables, magazine stands, porch swings, ironing boards, pieces of furniture, etc. The study of farm homes is being encouraged by the premiums offered in the agricultural class. These premiums induce the children to study plans for model houses, 'kitchens, barns, water systems for the farm home, and designing and interior decorations for a five-room cottage. Under sewing, the making of everyday garments is emphasized by offering larger premiums on them. Fancy work and novelties are also provided for, but the premiums are smaller. The premiums offered on school lunches put up in a box have excited a great deal of interest and attention. This alone is quite an incentive to the study of balanced rations. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 87 One of the most attractive features of the fair last year was an exhibit by the home and school garden clubs of the state. Many feet of shelving were built around the east end of the hall and in the center a table was constructed in the form of a hollow square, where canning demonstrations were conducted. Canning clubs from various towns in the state gave forenoon and afternoon demonstrations of the cold pact method of canning. The appended reports give more definite informa - tion upon this work. Another new feature was premiums offered to teachers for display - ing charts showing devices for illustrative teaching. The teaching of reading and expression, agriculture, primary arithmetic, home econom - ics, art, etc., are covered under this class. Premiums are also offered to encourage original work. Among the interesting exhibits last year was a model areoplane measuring over three feet in width. This areoplane was made by a small boy and was a very ingenious device It had made nights varying from 300 to 500 ft. Another boy exhibited a model bridge over 10 feet long having a street car line with two large trolley cars in operation thereon. One boy showed his military spirit by the exhibit of model battleships, torpedo boat destroyers ,etc. Since 1917 marks Nebraska's semi-centennial, this feature is being given special prominence in the premium list just issued. Children are being encouraged to make a special study of Nebraska history, pioneer days, growth, progress and civilization, natural resources and places at local historical interest in the state. The art department of the educational exhibit is endeavoring to interest the boy in business advertising, also in pottery made from Nebraska clay, cement models, etc. A new and interesting feature was the picture gallery prepared by the State Superintendent's office showing model buildings and grounds, play apparatus, children playing, exhibits in agriculture, domestic science and manual training, children at work, field meets, eighth grade exercises, school fairs, community meetings, school improvement clubs, consolidated schools with vehicles for transportation, teachers cottages, standardised schools, etc. State institutions supported by public taxes are not permitted to com - pete for premiums but are encouraged to make exhibits. Some very in - teresting things have been shown by the normal schools, the School for the Blind, the Orthopedic Hospital and the Nebraska State Library Com - mission. Peru Normal exhibited bas-reliefs in Nebraska clay; the Kearney State Normal fitted up a rest room and writing room, and ex - hibited many pictures of school activities. Students of the School for the Blind were present exhibiting their bead-work, sewing, point system of writing, use of the typewriter, etc. The Nebraska Library Commiadoa interested many people in the traveling libraries which are furnished to any school in the state upon payment of the transportation charges only. During the past biennium the commission has sent out approxi - mately 51,000 volumes. </seg>
            <seg id="p088">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 88 To show the many new, unusual and valuable features brought out by the growth along all lines of education in the past biennium we give the entire premium list for 1917. Total premiums amount to $950. HOME-SCHOOL GARDEN PROJECT The first of August the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture was asked to provide for special recognition of a new and practical phase of school work, the Home-School Garden Project. Early in the year twen - ty-six towns had organized supervised school and home garden clubs having a membership of 2,664 boys and girls between the ages of ten and eighteen, cultivating gardens containing from 100 square feet to one-half block of ground. Thus boys and girls at an early age are taking an interest in tilling the soil; studying elementary agricul - ture; are learning the proper methods of planting and caring for plants; marketing and making attractive displays. They are studying profit and loss, are keeping an account of the income on their investments and labor expended and are learning economy by canning their surplus pro - duce. The favorable action of the State Board of Agriculture made possible a wonderfully interesting and valuable exhibit and demonstration as set forth in the following report submitted by Mr. Leo McShane, State Garden Supervisor and District Club Leader: ; In August the State Fair Board, through the intercession of Secre - tary W. R. Mellor and Miss Lulu S. Wolford, Assistant State Superinten - dent of Public Instruction, made a special appropriation of one hundred dollars to the Educational department. This appropriation was to be used in establishing and defraying the expenses of the first Home-School Garden Project Exhibit at the Nebraska State Fair. Plans. LTwo objects were in view, in making plans for the Home-School Gar - n Exhibit: — , A. To familarize and present the "Achievements" of towns in the State of Nebraska completing the Home-Garden Project this year by: tl. A general survey of the Home-School Garden Project as adopted each of twenty-six towns in the state during the past season. Pictures i signs were used. , 2. A display of products, both fresh and canned, direct from the gar - dens and homes of the club members. 3. A practical demonstration of the "cold pack" method of canning, demonstrated by garden club canning teams from all parts of the state. B. Stimulate interest of garden club members by: — 1. Local and state competition of fresh vegetables, and competition </seg>
            <seg id="p089">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 89 2. Opportunity to display individual achievements in variety and quality of fresh and canned products. 3. Privilege of membership in a representative garden club canning team. A special class for fresh vegetables was created, premiums were offered for both local and state competition. Premiums were offered in the regular educational class for canned products. Prizes were offered for the towns placing the best aggregate exhibit of garden club members' individual exhibits and of garden club activities. Each garden club member exhibiting received an "Exhibitor" ribbon. Results. Six of the twenty-six towns carrying on the Home-School Garden Pro - ject sent exhibits. Each exhibit consisted of individual garden club members' exhibits of both fresh and canned products. a. Each town had entries in the majority of vegetables offered and Ailed the canned product class offered. b. Four towns sent a card exhibit of pictures showing garden club activities, working conditions and management. Five of the twenty-six towns carrying on the Home-School Garden Project sent a canning team consisting of three boys and three girls. Each canning team demonstrated the "cold pack" method of canning vegetables and fruits, one day of the Fair. Eleven hundred people signed their names for recipes and material concerning the "cold pack" method of canning to be sent to their homes by the Nebraska Agricultural Extension Service. The success of the exhibit can be attributed largely to Miss Lulu S. Wolford, Assistant State Superintendent of Public Instruction, in view of the fact that the Home-School Garden Project was made one of the special features of the Educational Exhibit. The quality and display of both fresh and canned products surpassed all expectations, and the highly interesting feature of the "Canning Demonstration" by garden club members attracted much attention. Ap - propriate signs and the arrangement of the exhibit booth added much to the general success of the exhibit. Secretary Mellor, A. O. Thomas, State Superintendent of Public In - struction, members of the State Fair and prominent citizens of the state expressed themselves concerning the exhibit and the work of the children as "Practical and Highly Educational." Plans for a larger and more complete exhibit for next year are under way at present. </seg>

EXAMINATIONS FOR CERTIFICATES Examinations are held on the third Friday and following Saturday of November, January, March and May, and on last Thursday and fol - lowing Friday of July each year. As complete instructions relative to the conducting of examinations for county certificates are given in the Nebraska Educational Bulletin for July 1916, we do not deem it essential that we enlarge upon this phase of the work of this department at this time. The examinations are uniform. The standard of grading the answer papers is also uniform throughout the state. This is the result of giving to one person all of the papers in a given subject from all counties of the state for grading purposes. Because of the fact that in the greater portion of the state there seems to be a surplus of teachers, and also for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the teaching profession, it was thought advisable by the State Superintendent and his assistants to raise the standard of require - ments for the several classes of certificates. These changes are inclu - ded in the present requirements for certification as found under county certificates in connection with this report. Certificates From Other States Lit has been one of my duties in connection with this department give an evaluation to certificates and grades from other states. It has in our aim -to make this matter uniform so far as practicable as ap - plied to the several states. In order to have this uniformity we have 6 accepting all grades of 80% or above from certificates from other ; when said grades were earned in an examination in which the ions were prepared and the answer papers graded by or under the ion of the State Superintendent. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 129 If the questions are prepared and answer papers graded by the county superintendent, we accept all grades of 80% or above in all of the norvessential subjects, but in the five essential subjects viz: arithmetic, geography, grammar, history and reading it is necessary for the holder of grades in these subjects to take examination in this state. The present administration has endeavored to clarify the certifica - tion system and thereby make it more easily understood by the average person. To this may be attributed the fact that there are fewer mistakes than were formerly made by those who are interested in carrying out the plan of the system. With the present force in this department of the work the mistakes have been reduced to a minimum. The work has bees done systematically, carefully and with much painstaking on the part of those who have in any way assisted during the biennium. There has been something of an increase in the amount of work handled by this department during the biennium just closing. About 39500 registration numbers have been assigned as compared with 38, - 000 during the preceding biennium.

            <seg id="p130">130 REPORT OF STATE SUPRINTENDENT STATE WIDE CELEBRATIONS From Nebraska Educational Bulletin on State-Wide Celebrations Of the Semi-Centennial of the Admission of Nebraska into the Union' Few states if any are richer in interesting pioneer materials than ours; few states present the dramatic in such stirring form. Nebraska was the home of many mighty dynasties; the first when great herds of shaggy buffalo made the earth tremble as they rushed across the plain in stampede. Following came the Indian who pitched his tepee beside the streams which abounded in fish, or stole forth over the game-abundant prairie. Hunting for game or contending with hostile tribes were both his employment and his pastime. Then came the soldier driving the redman from the plains and making straight the road for another empire. Following the soldier came the cattlemen with stately herds which began in the Gulf country in the earliest spring - time to graze their way by successive stages into the northland, mak - ing famous the cattle towns of Culbertson, Ogallala, Sidney and on out across the Platte into Wyoming, then on to Fort Benton. But these stately droves were broken up into smaller herds and the cattle kings held sway. With the cattle kings came the ranches of the Republican, the Platte, the Dismal and the Niobrara; with these came the grub trail, the cow camp, the broncho, the cayuse, the lariat and the stam - pede; the cowboy rough and ready, always dare-devil, with his spurs and chaparejos, waiting for pay day and celebrating the event by shoot - ing up the town as a part of his vaudeville performance. b Following these dynasties came the long lines of canvas-covered &gt;ns on the old trails to the Eldorado of the West, and the Mor - s on their way to the inter-mountain regions. After a while came the settler's cabin; fields and pastures induced the "building of the rail - road, along which tall elevators marked the stations. Cities came with Ehools and learning and culture followed until Nebraska grew well - vored, prosperous and rich. State pride and patriotism should mark is semi-centennial celebration.

STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY To the State Historical Society is due the credit for this important undertaking. The annual meeting of this society in 1915 made provision to appoint, through its President, Honorable John Lee Webster, a Committee of One Hundred members well distributed over the state, whose duty it is to provide ways and means for a fitting commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Admission of the State into the Union, which occurred March 1, 1867. FOREWORD Honorable Ross L. Hammond, Fremont This bulletin, as will be observed by a perusal of it, is sent out for the purpose of enlisting the people of the state in a fitting celebration of the semi-centennial anniversary of the admission of Nebraska into the Union as a state. To the committee on state-wide celebrations ha.s been assigned the duty of suggesting and directing that part of the observance of the important event to be participated in by the public schools of the state. In view of the exceptional opportunity offered for the study of Nebraska history and for focusing the public mind upon the achieve - ments and possibilities of Nebraska, effort has been made to elaborate a program that will be so varied, and withal so interesting, as to command the universal attention of the people. In the succeeding pages of this bulletin there will be found some general suggestions concerning the scope and the character of the work that is to be done. There will also be found tentative pro - grams to be carried out in the public schools at the county seats on March 1st, 1917, to commemorate the exact date of the entrance of Nebraska into the Union. It is asked that this bulletin be preserved as a guide to what is to be done. It is desired that wide interest may be aroused in this entrancing theme of the birth and making of a great state. In the public schools will be studied a course dealing specifically with Nebraska's early history and subsequent development. This si certain to appeal to the imagination of the young and to the interest of the older ones. It will not only be an educational factor of value, but it will stimulate the pride in and loyalty to the state of every citizen. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT It is expected that through pageantry, drama, the moving picture, literature, study, and various other ways, the whole people of Nebraska will be aroused to a high degree of enthusiasm. The pupils of the PO public schools of the state will be especially favored in the jrtunities they will have to profit by this notable observance of a event. To that end we desire the hearty co-operation of every 1, school patron and officer in Nebraska, to make this feature the eminent and paramount one of them all. ORGANIZATION FOR CELEBRATIONS L Plans to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the admission of the te of Nebraska into the Union were definitely formed some months ago. The Nebraska State Historical Society appointed a committee of one hundred citizens from different parts of the state to meet and consider such plans. The first meeting of the committee of one hun - dred was held in Omaha, Nebraska, in June 1915, at which meeting Honorable John L. Webster, President of the Society, gave a banquet to the committee at the Hotel Fontenelle in Omaha. At this meeting an Executive Committee of twenty-five was appointed to consider the matter in detail and report later. G. W. Wattles of Omaha was made chairman of this committee. Each member was requested to outline briefly his ideas of the manner in which the semi-centennial of the state should be celebrated. The Executive Committee reported on December 15, 1915, to the Committee of One Hundred the plans they had outlined for the celebrations as follows: "To the General Committee on the Semi-Centennial Celebiation of the State Historical Society of Nebraska — Gentlemen : We, the Executive Committee*, appointed to arrange a program for the semi-centennial celebration of the admission of the state of Ne - braska into the Union, beg leave to report as follows: 1. We recommend that the first celebration commemorating this event be held in Omaha in October, 1916, to celebrate the first steps toward statehood which were taken in this city during the year 1866 by the Territorial and Provisional State Legislatures by the adoption of a state constitution and the election of two United States senators; that the principal feature of the Omaha celebration shall be historical, spectacular street parades under the supervision and control of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben; that such additional features be added to the street parades as may be found expedient, such as an exhibit of the history, resources and products of the state by motion pictures, the production of a historical motion picture play, and other similar features to be worked out by a local committee in conjunction with the Board of Governors of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben. Honorable G. W. Wattles, Omaha </seg>

The Board of Governors of the Knights of Ak- Sar-Ben have assumed the responsibility for the celebration at Omaha in 1916 and are already engaged in the work of preparation. The committee appointed to have charge of the celebrations throughout the state have accepted the responsibility and have outlined the plans incident to the numerous celebrations in the schools and at the county seats in a very comprehensive manner. The work has been started by the Chairman of the Committee, Prof. A. O. Thomas, Super - intendent of Public Instruction. LA committee of twenty-five leading citizens of Lincoln have assumed responsibility incident to carrying out the celebrations planned at Lincoln. At a recent meeting of the full committee with the Commercial Club of Lincoln these plans were outlined and approved. The work incident to all the celebrations is now under way and, with the assistance and cooperation of all citizens in the state, who are interested in carrying out in every detail, to a successful termination, these plans, the success of the celebrations is to a large extent entrusted. It is hoped that every community will lend its influence to the end that the proposed celebrations may prove eminently successful.

Founding of Peru Normal VI. Semi-Centennial of the Founding of Peru — Education is the foundation of our free institutions. Not an educated aristocracy, but the education of the plain people is desired. Higher education is essen - tial, but the education of the masses in the fundamentals with which all should be familiar is vastly more essential. It is not the policy of educa - tion in America to lift a few men high above their fellows, but to place within everyone's reach the instrument with which he may function intelligently in a government where each citizen is called upon to exercise the right of a sovereign. Such belief is responsible for the founding of institutions for the training of teachers for the common schools. In 1867 the Peru Normal was established. Fitting celebration of the founding will be observed and the committee on state-wide cele - brations will appoint the president and faculty of the institution a* a special committee to arrange such functions as in their minds seem appropriate. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 Observance by State Fair tVII. Secretary Mellor of the State Board of Agriculture informs that Nebraskas semi-centennial shall be fittingly observed during the 1916 session of the State Fair. This institution has grown to marvelous proportions and affords our greatest opportunity to show what Nebraska is and the progress she has made during her fifty years of statehood. The central idea in 1916 will be the commemoration tour fifty years of progress and a revelation of our possibilities as a te whose basic industry is the production of food materials. THE HASKELL ODE CONTEST Honorable John D. Haskell of Wakefield, Nebraska, offered a prize of $100 for the best poem suitable for a Nebraska State Song, the same to be written by a resident of the state. The contest was spirited and brought out about four hundred contestants. On the first of March, Doctor L. A .Sherman of the Department of Literature of the Univer - sity of Nebraska, Miss Mary Crawford, Associate Professor of English in the State Normal School at Kearney, and President William E. Nicholl of Bellevue College, sitting as a committee of judges, awarded the prize of $100 to the Reverend William H. Buss of Fremont, Nebraska, and the following poem was selected. Many meritorious poems were submitted, which demonstrates that Nebraska is not without literary talent. HYMN TO NEBRASKA Reverend William H. Buss, Fremont Now laud the proud tree planter state, Nebraska, — free, enlightened, great; Her royal place she has in song: The noblest strains to her belong: Her fame is sure. Then sing Nebraska through the years; Extoll her stalwart pioneers; The days when, staunch and unafraid, The State's foundations, well they laid, To long endure. </seg>

The land, beside whose borders sweep The big Missouri's waters, deep, Whose course erratic, through its sands, From northland on, through many lands. Does seaward run. The foothills of the Rockies lie Afar athwart her western sky Her rolling prairie, like the sea, Held long in virgin sanctity, Her fertile loam. Her wild-life roamed o'er treeless plains. Till came the toiling wagon-trains, And settlers bold, far westward bound. In broad Nebraska's valley found, Their chosen home. Now o'er her realm and 'neath her sky, Her golden harvests richly lie; Her corn more vast than Egypt yields; Her grain unmatched in other fields; Her cattle rare: Alfalfa fields, by winding streams; And sunsets, thrilling poets' dreams; These all we sing, and know that tine, Has ne'er revealed a fairer clime, Or sweeter air. O proud Nebraska, brave and free; Thus sings thy populace to thee. Thy virile strength, thy love of light; Thy civic glory, joined with right. Our hearts elate.

Her capital of worthy fame, That bears the mighty Lincoln's name, And thousands of Nebraska youth E'er summons to her fount of truth, At learning's seat. FORM LOCAL HISTORICAL SOCIETIES As a means of stimulating interest in the study of local history, neighborhood historical societies should be formed. These societies should include all who are interested in the study. Pupils and adult citizens should work together. If there are old settlers in the neigh - borhood they should be induced to join, to attend and to relate exper - iences and adventures; they should be induced to visit the schools in the neighborhood and participate in the history lesson. The stories told and incidents related should be preserved. If there is a historical society in the county organized as a permanent society these historical collections should be placed in its care for preservation. If there is no regularly organized historical society, the school or the County superin - tendent may be made the custodian. BEGIN WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT There will never be a more opportune time to collect early Nebraska history than the present. Those who had to do with the early life and development of the state are passing. If we expect to enrich our archives with the rarest incidents it must be done now. The teacher in every school should direct the study of the school and teach the </seg>
            <seg id="p139">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 139 children the value of sources of authentic data, should teach them how to interview the oldest residents, to find out where persons live who were identified with the first days of the neighborhood and write to them, or to other schools to send interviews. Pictures of old buildings, streets, schools, etc., should be collected. A complete history of the school district should be written this year. The following outline may be of service to some. 1. When organized. 2. Changes in boundaries. 3. Collect names of persons who have served as members of the board of trustees. 4. Teachers who have been employed in the school and the time each taught. 5. Pupils who have attended the district school and who have acquired distinction. 6. Teachers who have taught in the district and who have since achieved distinction. 7. Events which distinguish the school in any way and mark its advancement. 8. Changes in organization. 9. Early settlers of the district. 10. Historic places, if any, within the district; old land marks should be photographed; photographs of pioneers should be secured. STUDY— HOW CONDUCTED Regular classes may be organized within the school and assigned a regular place in the program; or neighborhood societies may be formed, whichever seems more expedient. However, some time within the school should be devoted to the study in order to systematize it. These societies should have regular time for meeting and should not be too infrequent. The schoolhouse would seem a good meeting place, although the society could meet at the homes of pioneers occasionally if such persons are unable to attend at the regular meeting place.

The increased interest in our country schools and a keener appreciation of the possibilities of country life make, possible advancement in many avenues formerly closed. As we become aware of our opportunities and possibilities in the State of Nebraska we shall exert ourselves more systematically to bring things to pass. Next to the home the school should be the most important place in the community. This has not been taken into serious considera - tion in most instances. The schools of our state are like unto two sisters of one household; the one beautiful, the other plain and even homely; the one arrayed in fine linen, the other clad in the coarse garments of menial toil; the one stationed in the parlor amid paintings, statuary, literature and music; the other delegated to the rear of the house among pots and pans; the one presented to all the gay comers; the other shunned as of small con - sequence. Go where you will about the state and in our towns and cities you will see, crowning the hilltop, splendid edifices, marble palaces pointed out with extravagant pride; while out in the country the little old schoolhouse, cheaply built, with battered sides, stands hidden in the vale or bleak on the hilltops, with no vestige of verdure but sun - flowers and ragweeds — and yet the most of our children are in the country and the mainstay of our democracy receives its preparation in this little institution. Realizing the possibilities the country affords for contented, pros - perous and useful life, and the needs of some systematic effort to "brighten the corner where we are", the Department has asked Professor Nicolet, the landscape architect of the University of Nebraska, to prepare the material which this bulletin contains hoping to stimulate greater activity in beautifying our schools. Much of the improvement herein called for may be accomplished by the pupils through the encourage - ment of the parents and the Board of Trustees. While this bulletin is calculated especially for the villages and the country districts, it contains many suggestions profitable to our towns and cities. , A. O. THOMAS, State Superintendent. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT LANDSCAPE GARDENING AS APPLIED TO RURAL SCHOOL GROUNDS By Prof. Tell W. Nicolet of the University of Nebraska, Department of Horticulture. The Movement to Beautify School Grounds. The movement to beautify school grounds, which is fast spreading over our country, has made very rapid progress during the last few - years. People have begun to realize the value of school grounds properly laid out in accordance with the principles of landscape gardening, and with the proper relation ship between the building and the various parts of the grounds; such as gardens, play areas, lawn areas and planting EXISTING CONDITIONS Grounds Generally Overlooked. From the general appearance of most of our Nebraska school grounds, it is evident that something should be done to make them more inviting to the students. We have learned the value of proper lighting and ventilating which has been expressed in the design of most of the rural school houses that have been built during the last few years; but in regard to the arrangements of the grounds there seems to have been practically no forethought emphasied in any degree. It appears that country schools have been regarded as just places to send children in order that they might secure an education; there has been little regard for a proper environment. Plantings. The few trees that exist on most of the school grounds of this country at large have been placed there by nature, but in Nebraska, ex - cept where trees have been planted, the school grounds are entirely de - void of any sort of tree or shrub growth. Some attempt has been made, however, to plant a few trees for the purpose of a windbreak along the north and west boundaries of the school lot, but it has failed to give satisfactory results, from the esthetical as well as the practical standpoint in nearly all instances. Need for Play Areas. It is to be acknowledged that children must play; the larger boys are wont to participate in the various sports such as football, baseball, basketball, etc., as well as gymnastics; the larger girls in basketball, volleyball, croquet, etc., and the smaller children play under the direct supervision of the school teacher. This fact has given rise to the in - troduction of organized play in most of the large municipal play grounds </seg>
            <seg id="p145">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 145 in this country as well as in those occurring in many of the rural dis - trict.-. Proper attention should be paid to the size and location of these areas as well as the other elements such as the school garden, the out - buildings, walks, etc. It is certainly not out of place to provide for such a demand in the laying out of our school grounds. Size of School Grounds Most country school grounds are entirely too small. The children who are being brought up in the country are not accustomed to being cramped in narrow quarters. They enjoy the freedom of the open coon - try, the views of miles about them, and for this reason the rural school grounds should carry out the same idea as expressed by the surrounding country. As has been stated before, boys and girls must play; and if the grounds cannot provide sufficient area for baseball, football, and other games, the areas which should be in lawn as well as that of the road will be utilized for this purpose. For any community that wishes to improve the conditions of its school grounds no better advice could be given at the start than that of the purchase of more land. This must, of course, be warranted by a sufficient number of students. Educational Value All children, even the smallest, delight in a healthful and beautiful environment and for this reason alone it is essential that the school grounds be designed from an esthetical point of view as well as the practical. The esthetical side of a child's education must not be en - tirely neglected and if the students of the rural schools are given a chance to beautify the grounds, they will not only acquire some knowl - edge of landscape design but will also become acquainted with trees, shrubs, and perennials, their planting and culture. Any school con taining play areas protected by an adequate windbreak, will most cer - tainly attract the country child to it. Furthermore, it would serve as a center of rural improvement where people of the community could come in order to secure ideas for the development of the home grounds. With these conditions in mind it is the intention of the writer to so describe the design of rural school grounds that they may fulfill all of the above requirements. , THE PLAN Value of a Plan In the design of any ground, whether private, public, or that of the school, the plan is very important. In the first place the designer is better able to study the problem at hand by means of a plan. Usually, no two school grounds are exactly the same sixe, shape, have the same kind of soil, or the same views; in fact, the schoolhouses themselves are of various sizes and placed in different positions upon the ground. By the use of a plan one is able to see the entire situation at a glance </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT and accordingly is better able to lay out the different units; such as play grounds, lawn, planting areas, school gardens, as well as the loca - tion of the sanitaries. The relation of schoolhouse to grounds, of walks to grounds and school house, of planting area to lawn areas, etc., can be studied out with a greater degree of accuracy by means of a graphic plan than they could be without it Not only would the relationship of different areas be made evident, but the designer would be better able to study out the exact location of the planting areas, the sizes of the beds for the shrubs, as well as the number of shrubs which should be planted in any particular group. In the second place a plan outlines a definite policy of development. This permits the carrying out of the plan over a number of years if it is not possible to realize the designer's idea at one time. Thirdly, a very important value of a plan, if properly exe - cuted and hung in a conspicuous place, would be to create in the parents as well as the children themselves an interest in the development of that particular school ground. The best place to display such a plan would be in the schoolhouse itself where the students might study and observe how it is being carried out. Fl«. 1. A suggested plan of arrangement fur the consolidated school grounds. The M'lioolbuuM- is located to the left of the center of the lot anl the ti-Hch - er» cottage placed In clow proximity to it. The girls' and small children's play area Is located near the school bouse, hence under the watchful eyes of the teachers. The barn and parking space, where the students mar leave ibelr bones and carriages during school hours, tre located in the lower right hand corner of the design. The boys' playfleld contains a full size tmaeoall diamond, a MO yard running track as well as provisions for other field event*.

            <seg id="p147">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 147 MAIN CONSIDERATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN Orientation Naturally, there are school grounds which are located on the north, south, east, or west sides of the road and the design of the grounds must necessarily be influenced by this orientation. For instance, if the school building: faces the south the windbreak which should be along the north side of the property would naturally be located behind the building. If. however, the building faces the north, as is the case with the school in District 36 in Madison county, Nebraska, (See Fig. 3). it may be necessary to put the windbreak in front of the building along the road line. If this is done, an entirely different treatment will be ne - cessary in the grouping of the trees and shrubs which compose the windbreak. Shape of Lot The shape of the lot will have a marked influence on the general arrangement of the grounds. A long, narrow lot with the short side abutting the- highway to all intents and purposes will make just as suit - able a layout as a long, narrow lot with the long side facing the road. The square lot will make still another scheme of development. It will be easily seen that in the first case (See Fig. 2) the area between the school house and the road may be kept in lawn with perhaps one or two walks crossing it and that the play areas and school gardens can be placed behind the school house. In the case of the long, narrow lot with the long side facing the road (Fig 3) the building may be placed in about the center of the lot, with the lawn lying between it and the road. The playground for boys might then be placed on one side of the structure and that for the girls on the other. As for the square lot (Fig. 4) the problem of arranging the grounds becomes a little more difficult. The lawn area should, as in the case of the previous example, be located in front of the schoolhouse and in some cases it may also ex - tend on both sides, while the play grounds must necessarily be located, in most cases, in the rear of the lot. The boys and girls playsteads should be separated by a marked barrier which may be in the form of a shrubbery or in some instances merely a straight walk. Thus, it will be seen that the shape of the lot will influence the arrangement of the different parts to a very considerable extent, and it must be borne in mind that before any planting of school grounds is undertaken the plan of arrangement must first be completed. Size of Grounds As before stated the school grounds are not large enough for the purposes which they are supposed to serve. In case of small school grounds which comprise, let us say, one quarter of an acre- it is almost impossible for the students to indulge in any of the field sports. Th« baseball diamond requires an area of about one and one-half acres, but </seg>
            <seg id="p148">- 148 it is not always necessary to have a full sized one. There are a great many miniature diamonds made with but 40 to 50 feet between the bases which are adapted for exigencies of this sort. Where there are 50 students attending a school the grounds should comprise no less than three acres, and if there are 75 or 100 students the grounds should be at least four to five acres. The grounds of the proposed consolidated school will include about five acres. It would be better to have more land than is absolutely needed at the present time in order to provide for expected growth in the future. Selection of a Site It is not best to locate the school on low ground, because there arises not only the question of drainage but also the matter of outlook which must be somewhat narrow in such situations. It is likewise disas - trous to locate the school on top of a hill where it would be subjected to severe exposure. The southeast slope is best. In regard to the section it is better to locate the schoolhouse on the corner where it will be most accessible. Furthermore, if it can be placed on the northwest or north - east corner it will be better adapted to a scheme of development inas - much as the windbreaks would be in the rear, where they would not only serve as protections but also act esthetically, as a background. </seg>

            <seg id="p150">150 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT LThe careful consideration of all good views which may be obtained i the school is very important. In many cases the design itself might be influenced by some particular and dominant view. Plantings Influenced by Climate and Soil Climatic and soil conditions must not be overlooked and the designer must use only those trees and shrubs which he knows will thrive in that particular location. For this reason the material obtained from the nearest nursery will more often prove to be the best to use. Prevailing Winds Prevailing winds must naturally be considered in the laying out of any grounds in our state. A certain amount of protection is needed from the hot southwest winds of summer. But these winds do not bear such a great influence on the design of school grounds as the cold northwest winds of winter ,at which time the school house should be protected more than at any other season of the year. Water Supply U Naturally, the question of good water, is important, both for drink - purposes and for watering the lawn, trees, and shrubs.

            <seg id="p151">OF PUBUC INSTRUCTION 151 Financial Condition of Community The designer must suggest a scheme of development that will be within the financial means of the district. Furthermore he should give them a plan which will require the least amount of maintenance. The latter point is indeed very important as it is difficult to get a hard working community of farmers to allow time for that purpose. PRINCIPLES OF LANDSCAPE GARDENING THAT APPLY TO RU- RAL SCHOOL GROUNDS Deinition Landscape gardening is the subdivision of land into smaller units and the arrangement of objects upon it so that there will be the maximum of utility combined with the greatest amount of beauty. By this defini - tion it may be readily seen that the arrangement of the grounds is of the greatest importance in landscape work. This is particularly true in the case of school grounds where the limited area must serve so many needs. The type of development which should be chosen for school grounds is that which will utilize the greatest per cent, of the lot area. Types There are in general two types of landscape gardening; the formal or geometrical and the informal or natural. Formal The formal type is usually characterized by straight lines or circu - lar curves expressed by the walks, hedges, trees, etc., and by an obvious balanced relationship or symmetry of the different units of the design about a main axis. This type of landscape gardening produces the high - est efficiency in the utilization of a given area, and for the reason it is adapted for school ground development. Informal The informal type is very different from the geometrical. The various areas are generally non-rectangular in shape and the symmetry is more incomprehensible. The walks are usually curved, and the plant - ings are so designed that they will, in a general way. appear as though they were planted by Nature. , Type for School Grounds The type of development which is best suited to rural school grounds is one which is formal in its general layout and informal in its plantings. This type avails itself of the economy of space of the formal plan without the loss of the informal beauties so widely associated with the country. </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 152 One of the most important principles of any type of landscape gardening to be considered is that the lawn should be left comparatively open in the front and that the trees and shrubs should be planted in masses along the sides and back, as well as around the base of the school building. If the grounds are treated in this way it is very easy to see that there will be a certain oneness in effect; that is, there will be a unity in the design. If, however, the trees are planted in rows and the lawn literally cluttered up with individual specimens there will result a number of objects all of which are competing for the interest of the observer. Naturally instead of producing one picture of the grounds, we obtain a great many. What we wish to do is to produce a picture of the grounds with the schoolhouse as the center of interest. Prof. F. A. Waugh has given us this definition of unity — "some idea should prevail throughout and all details should be subordinate to it." This is exactly what has been expressed before in this paragraph — that the main idea is the schoolhouse, and no part of the grounds should be of sufficient in - terest to detract from it. The trees and shrubs should be so ar - ranged that they will appear as one mass rather than a number of in - dividual specimens. Monotony — Variety In planting only one kind of a shrub throughout there would arise a certain unity both in regard to size and material, but the result would be very monotonous. Without overstepping unity ,a certain amount of variety can be introduced in the plantings as well as in certain portions of the design itself. Variety may be obtained by varying the dimensions of the play grounds, by introducing different kinds and sizes of trees and shrubs into the border plantation, etc. There are species of trees and shrubs which have very distinctive shapes, and by their judicious use a certain amount of variety may be introduced in the actual sil - houette of the planting, as well as in the size and color of the flowers, and the time of the bloom. THE DESIGN Location of Schoolhouse The schoolhouse, which in most cases has already been located, should be comparatively near the road in order that more area at the rear of the building may be available for play grounds. The question of proper facilities for handling wood and coal should have careful consideration. It is often necessary for a service drive to enter the grounds at some point which will not interfere with the Earea of the school grounds. This drive should be direct; the coal and horse barn can be placed somewhere along it and perhaps i into the picture by the use of trees and shrubs. </seg>
            <seg id="p153">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 153 Sanitariea The placing of the sanitaries should be very carefully considered. Usually the best location for them is in the rear corners of the property. In the case of a larger lot, the sanitaries should be placed in some con - venient relation to the building. fit. « Designs very similar to the above have been curried out with a great deal of Mii-iws in a few riunmunities.

There Is very little waste spare in this layout. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The walks should usually be of some coarse material such as crushed stone, gravel or cinders. In any case they should have a slight crown in order that the water might flow from the •surface as quickly C possible. Naturally, the- walks which are located in close proximity the school house will be used to a greater degree than some of the outlying ones and it is thoroughly recommended therefore that they should be of some permanent material such as brick or concrete. Playgrounds The play ground area for boys should contain, if possible, a basket - ball court, a baseball diamond, and a running track. The girls play area should include basketball, volleyball and croquet courts. The small chil - dren's play area might include sand boxes and swings. The larger areas might will be kept in turf. In the case of the smaller ones, where grass is impracticable, a gravel or cinder surfacing is to be preferred to dirt inasmuch as the latter becomes very muddy after a rain storm. The School Garden Not every rural school might need a school garden. When desired, however, it should be located upon the school lot and can be made a unit in the design just as well as the play grounds, or the lawn areas, or the schoolhouse. To secure unity in the design it will be almost ne - cessary to enclose the garden by some sort of an artificial barrier, such as a fence covered with vines or a hedge either clipped or undipped. The hedge should consist of one kind of shrub, planted in absolutely straight rows and close together. This will cut off the view of the garden from any part of the school yard, and thus the unity for which we are striving so hard, will be maintained. Tree* to Enframe Views Trees and shrubs are, in the main, the materials which the landscape gardener uses. They have a practical as well as an esthetical value. The trees should be so placed that they will serve to frame the picture of the schoolhouse. Usually more than one view of the schoolhouse is desirable and trees should be so arranged that they will enframe all of them. Not only must the views of the schoolhouse be empha - sized but all of those obtained from the different windows of the build - ing should, if possible, be framed by trees. It may not always be pos - sible to preserve all of the views and in most cases it is better to em - phasize a few good vistas instead of a great many poor ones. The type of tree which is best for such a frame is that kind which will eventually become a large tree. The white elm is an excellent tree for this pur - pose as well as the Norway maple. American sycamore, white ash and scarlet oak. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 155 Trees as • Screen Sometimes there are undesirabble surroundings which may be seen from the schoolhouse or from the various parts of the grounds, and in this case a group of trees may be used to "plant it out," as it is often termed. The Carolina poplar, Lombardy poplar, and soft maple are rapid growers and may be used for screening purposes. It is thoroughly advised, however, that Black Hills spruce, bull pine, and Scotch pine be introduced into these groups together with the before mentioned quick growers so that an all-year-around screen will eventually be secured. Shade Trees Shade is essential on all school grounds in that it offers cool, invit - ing places to sit and thus be protected from the hot sun of the early fall and late spring. It is not best, however, to plant trees for this purpose in rows on the lawn area which occupies that space between the school - house and the road. Two or three trees on the lawn are usually suffi - cient, and they should be placed rather near the building, but not directly in front of it. If properly located in relation to the design as a whole, other shade trees may be used in the immediate vicinity of the play ground area where they may serve a useful purpose to those who seek a few moments rest after violent exercise.

The Windbreak Trees may form the framework of the belt plantations or wind - breaks which will adequately protect the school grounds from the severe winds of winter and spring. It has been the custom in Nebraska to plant trees in three or four rows along the north and west sides of the grounds, and the result has been that when the trees become fifteen </seg>

It is essential to use both trees and shrubs in our windbreaks, and they may be grouped in masses and not planted in straight rows. The width of this border plantation should vary, thus creating certain bays or hollows formed by the curved outline of the shrub and tree masses. The natural result of such planting will be to make the size of the grounds seem greater, and to create a more interesting border composed of masses of trees and flowering shrubs. This will at the same time serve an utilitarian purpose in the protecting of the schoolhouse and its environments from the winds. Choice of Material Questions on choice of trees and shrubs for windbreaks are con - stantly being asked. There are a great many trees and shrubs that may be used in eastern Nebraska, but in the very dry localities, they must be chosen with great care. It is thoroughly advised to introduce evergreens in the belt plantations both in the eastern and western parts of the state. They are very drought resistant and make fast growth when once established. Among those which may be used in eastern Ne - braska are the native bull, jack. Austrian, Scotch and white pines, the red cedar, the concolor fir, the Black Hills, Colorado blue, and Douglas spruces, while the Jack and bull pines may be grown in almost any part Fl«. 7 Fl«. «.

The deciduous trees which may be introduced into the wind break may include honey locust, white elm, hackberry, green ash, and Russian olive as well as scarlet oak, pin oak and Norway maple. For Ki of introducing variety in the masses of the border plantation trees may be used such as red bud, wild plum, prairie crab, and ary. </seg>
            <seg id="p157">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 157 Shrubs Shrubs are essential elements of the windbreak inasmuch as they supply the much needed undergrowth which fills in the space between the ground and the foliage of the trees, thus producing a barrier which should offer adequate protection to the schoolhouse and its en - vironments. The elderberry, sumac, snowberry, coralberry, red dog - wood, buffalo berry, wild currant, honeysuckle, snowball, Van Houttei's spirea. lilac, mock orange, Juneberry, Amur River and Polish privets, rosa rugosa, as well as many others, may be recommended for the east - ern part of Nebraska, while the sandcherry, smooth sumac and Russian mulberry, buffalo berry, bush honeysuckle, spireas and viburnums may be grown in the more arid portions. It must be borne in mind, however, that there are portions of this state which do not readily sup - port tree and shrub growth without watering or irrigation, as well as a great deal of personal attention, and for this reason it is doubtful if any list of trees and shrubs could be recommended at present that will be entirely free from criticism. Shrubbery Planting About Schoolhouse Shrubs may be grouped about the base of the school building for the purpose of blending the straight and vertical architectural lines of the structure into the gentle flowing lines of its surroundings. These shrubs should be planted in groups instead of one continuous mass ex - tending entirely around the building. Portions of the foundation should be visible in order that the structure will at least give the impression of standing on the ground. Usually the larger specimens should be planted at the corners with the medium and smaller growing ones in front. It might be well to use some of the better flowering varieties about the building and among them might be mentioned Weigelia rosea Lonicera Morrowii, Lonicera tartarica, Forsythia fortunei. and Spirea Van Hout - tei, which should be placed in the background, and Berberis Thunbergii, Symphoricarpos racemosus, Rhodotypus kerrioides, Symphoricarpos vul - garis, Rosa rugosa, and Ribes aureum which may be planted in front of the higher growing ones.

It is essential that the principles of unity, form, texture, ■color, etc., as well as variety, should be strictly adhered to. The charac - teristics of the plants should, then, be given very careful consideration. There are tall spire shaped trees as well as long globular forms. Some shrubs have an upright habit of growth while others are more low and spreading. In view of this fact a word may be necessary as to the proper placing of them in the masse*. Shrubs should be planted in </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT groups of 5 to 15 or 20. In some instances it may be necessary to plant more than these amounts in one group. The taller shrubs should be placed in the background and about 4 to 5 feet apart. The medium growing kinds may be placed in front of these (the individual plants placed 3 to 4 feet apart) and the low growing shrubs in the foreground (2 to 3 feet apart). Not only should the shrubs be arranged according to heighth but the color and time of bloom is also essential. Among our native shrubs we have some which have red flowers, while others have Cllow, cream, pink, rose or white ones. It is very necessary that the lor schemes be planned with a great deal of care. The unharmonious colors, such as red and pink or blue and red, should not be placed to - gether, but should in fact be separated by a shrub which has white flowers. However, the shrub which has the red flowers might bloom in May while the pink flowered one would not bloom until the latter part of June, and in this case it would be correct to place these together, if they carried out the desired effect in the mass as regards height and texture. It would not be in the best of taste to use coarse leaved shrubs entirely, nor would it be correct to use shrubs which have only fine leaves. To carry out a variation in the texture it will be necessary to group together shrubs of heavy and medium, heavy and light, or medium and light foliage. Flowers L Flowers may be planted in the shrub borders as well as about the ool building, in groups of perhaps 5 to 8 or 10, and only those species should be chosen that will bloom in the spring and fall at which times the school will be in session. The taller kinds should naturally placed in the background and the smaller ones in front. The kind of flowers that should be used on school grounds are those which require the least amount of care. Herbaceous perennials such as columbine, aster, hardy chrysanthemum, delphinium, pinks, iris, lily, peony, oriental poppy, wild phlox, and yucca are especially recommended. They die down to the ground during the winter months and grow again the following spring. Flower beds should never be placed in the lawn. Vine. Vines and climbing roses may be grown on the building as well as on the outhouses and fences. Trellises made of wood, or wire should be used, especially if the structure is constructed of wood. The honey - suckles, clematis, and rambler roses are to be especially recommended for growing about the schoolhouse while Engleman's ivy, wild grape, honeysuckle and clematis may be grown on the outbuildings. CONSTRICTION AND MAINTAINENCE Executing the Plan It has been suggested by many prominent men interested in the development of school grounds of our country that some sort of a planting bee might be appropriate in the spring when the fathers and </seg>
            <seg id="p159">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 159 older brothers might be drafted for a few days to help out in the plant - ing. In some instances it is not possible to carry out all of the design the first year and in fact it would be better if the work were carried over for a period of three or four years. The execution of the design might in this case be done by the students themselves under the* careful supervision of the teacher. The trees should be carefully located and planted the first year. The walks, playground areas and service drive should be located and built at the same time. The shrubs may be planted after the trees have had one year to establish themselves. Flowers in the way of herbaceous perennials or annuals may be planted the third year It will not be necessary to go into detail as to the construction of the play ground areas, walks, or the service drive as such matters are well understood. Planting — Cultivation After the tree and shrub areas have been laid out on the ground in accordance with the plan they should be thoroughly spaded up to a depth of at least 12 inches. It must be borne in mind that the trees and shrubs should be placed deeper in the ground than they were before being moved. In the dryer parts of the state it is well to plant them 3 inches lower. The trees should be planted first and the location for the shrubs marked by stakes. The holes should then be dug for the shrubs in these spaded areas and the plants set in place. The perennials should be planted in much the same manner as the shrubs; the taller ones toward the rear of the group; the medium size next in front and the lower growing kinds in the foreground. Plant them deep enough to prevent the roots from being _ exposed after the first rainfall. The ground must be packed about the roots. The test of good planting is proven when it is impossible to pull the plants up. These planting areas should be carefully cultivated for the first three years or so after being planted and the weeds kept away from the trees, shrubs and flowers at all times inasmuch as they sap the moisture from the ground which the latter should have. In other words the planting areas will have to be treated in exactly the same way as you would care for a garden for these areas are nothing more or less than gardens of trees, shrubs and flowers. Watering If water is obtainable on the grounds it might be well to water the plants once every day or every other day until well established. Further - more, it may be a good expedient to apply water from time to time during the summer months, especially the first year after planting. Pruning Each spring the trees and shrubs will have to be pruned back; that is. cutting out the dead wood and cutting back the last year's growth in order that the plant will throw out more branches, thus making a </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 160 more dense growth. There are many good bulletins and books written upon the subject of pruning trees and shrubs and it might be well to acquire one before attempting any pruning. Care of Flowers A mulch of straw or manure should be spread over the perennial beds after the ground has frozen and raked off in the spring when the danger of frost has passed. The cannas and dahlia bulbs must be dug up in the fall and placed in a cool cellar. In the spring they should be divided and replanted. Making the Lawn A good lawn is one of the first and most fundamental features of the grounds, but nothing in garden making requires more thorough pre - paration and diligent care than does a perfect lawn. The ground should be plowed and harrowed three to five times in each direction. Then apply well rotted barnyard manure at the rate of twenty-five tons to the acre and work it well into the soil. Rake to a perfect grade and seed with the following mixture: Care of the Lawn Eight and one-half bushels of this mixture should be sown to the acre, or one pound to 300 square feet. The ground should be raked in order that the seed will be entirely covered, and then rolled with no less than 300 pound roller. Do not make the mistake of too frequent water - ings as they have a tendency to weaken the drought resisting qualities of the lawn. Allow the grass to grow three inches or so before mowing the first time, and then keep it about two inches high. During the early winter, when the ground is frozen, a light application of well rotted manure will aid to offset the effect of alternate freezing and thawing and serve also as a fertilizer. The manure should be raked off in the early spring. Bulbs in the Lawn It is well to plant groups of narcissus in the lawn after it is well established. They add interest in the early spring and die down long before it is neces»ary to mow. Plant them in irregular groups of 50 to 100, 6 to 12 inches apart and 5 to 7 inches deep.
