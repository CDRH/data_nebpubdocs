Bostrom,( Deputy State rinarian as vice-president, and W. R. Mellor, Secretary of the State d of Agriculture, as secretary. Upon the departure of Prof H. R. h from Nebraska, February 1st, 1912, Dr. A. Bostrom was elected dent. I Originally fifteen inspectors were selected from the assistant dep - veterinarians to the state veterinarian, none of whom were appli - s for the position. These men made the first itinerary of the state nning about September 20th 1911. The second began about Jan - 20th, 1912. For the second itinerary additional veterinarians • secured so that at the present time forty-three assistant deput;. i veterinarians are used for inspectors. All the itineraries are ted out in the office, notices prepared and forwarded to all owners tallions and Jacks, so far as known, and also to local newspapers lublicatlon, in which notice was given of the time and place where </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 the inspector wculd be, as he wai required to run according to regular schedule. The inspector examines the animal presented for defects and collects the fee and registration certificate, if a pure bred, whlCA he forwards to the office with an affidavit of defects found, if any. The record of each animal is made up for the office from these affidavits, and registry certificates, and license certificate issued for those coining within scope of the law. If under the law certificate cannot Issue, blank state vouchers are forwarded to the owner of the animal, who upon signing, swearing to and returning same receives a state warrant for the amount paid for the inspection. All receipts are recorded in the office and original evidence of value deposited with the State Treas - urer who is custodian of all Stallion Registration funds under the law. If any party owning an animal that has been inspected, is dissat - isfied with the work of the inspector, he should write the Board to that effect, stating exactly in what way he is dissatisfied in all cases giving the name and number of the animal. Upon receipt of such a letter the Board will send the owner an affidavit to be signed by some qualified veterinarian after he has examined the animal. Upon re - ceipt of the affidavit properly signed, if not corresponding with the original affidavit, the Board will send a third uninterested veterinar - ian to re-examine the stallion. If he agrees with the veterinarian who signs the affidavit sent to the stallion owner, the part objected to on the license will be removed. On the other hand, if this veterinarian agrees with the original inspector the case will be dropped. No ex - pense attaches to the owner by reason of veterinarians sent from this Board except as stated in the original law. I The Nebraska Stallion Registration Board is glad to assist parties le registering of their pure-bred animals (whether or not they be ion owners.) We shall endeavor to have in our files, blanks for itering, and if any one has young stock which he wishes to register, can forward the certificate of the registration 01 the sire and dam he office of the Nebraska Stallion Registration Board, together recording fees, the amount of which fees of the various societies be found in another part of this report. The Board will be glad take out the application and return the papers to the owner without </seg>

The above statement of expenditures does not include the neces- sary expenses for the coming three months until new inspections be- gin, nor payment, postage and express on an 8000 edition of the annual teport, so that the total expense for the first year's workings of this Board will aggregate about two-thirds of total receipts, therefore, for the future, contemplating adequate laws for enforcement, three dol- lars per inspection should be sufficient as a charge for compulsory pre- sentation and inspection at some central point not to exceed six miles from the home barn of the animal brought from the greatest distance.

            <seg id="p015">14 I RKTHKAL GLEET. Bj Dr. A. BoKtrum, State Veterinarian. This term Is commonly used in speaking of a diseased condition accompanied with a chronic discharge of a muco-purulent character from the urethral opening of stallions and jacks. This discharge is generally the result of a chronic inflamation or abscess of the urethra, bladder, or testicles, or it may be due to horse syphylis or dourine, and to called Urethral Gleet. This condition is due to the presence of some infectious agent in the form of bacteria or blood parasites, which is transmitted by con - tagion, and almost exclusively in the act of coition, and both the male and female are equally susceptible. For this reason such animals should be prohibited by law from having sexual intercourse. The dan - ger of the dissemination of this disease by the stallion is much greater that that from the mare. A stallion or Jack affected with this disease and allowed to be used for public service would ordinarily mean the service of about seventy-five mares during the season. A mare similar - ly affected would under ordinary conditions come into such contact with only one stallion, and therefore the danger of spreading the dis - ease would be in the proportion of one from the mare to seventy-live from the stallion. I.'OIRIXE I This is a specific infectious disease affecting, under natural con - ns, only the horse and the ass. transmitted from animal to animal le act of copulation, and due to an animal parasite or protozoan n as the Trypanosoma equiperdum. It is characterized by an ir - ar incubation period, the confinement of the first symptoms to the al tract, the chronic course which it runs, and by finally producing lete paralysis of the posterior extremities, with a fatal termination Dm six months to two years. In the United States this disease was first discovered in 1886 by W. L. Williams at Bloomington, Illinois. The infection was traced to E:heron stallion imported from France'in 1882, which had a brand under the mane very much resembling the letter D (Dourine?) supposed that he was affected with the disease and had been ed in France before being transported to this country. I In 1892 Dourine was brought into public notice by the appearance n outbreak among the breeding horses of Northwestern Nebraska, history of which suggested that it originated from a stallion shipped a the infected territory in Illinois to Gordon, Nebraska. An inspec - of the Bureau of Animal Industry investigated the outbreak and id that upward of two hundred mares and stallions were affected i the disease. Steps for the eradication of this outbreak were be - in June, 1893, at which time some of the diseased animals had and the breeders were using all the precautions possible to pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p016">15 vent its spread. Under the authority of the United States Secretary of Agriculture all diseased animals still alive, including thirty-two In Ne - braska and five in South Dakota, were purchased and destroyed. After an expenditure of $5,500 the disease was considered to have been eradicated from that section of the country. Five years later the in - fection again made its appearance in the same portion of the State of Nebraska and early in 1S99 the Bureau of Animal Industry again be - gan the work of eradication. Many inspections were made and those animals which were found diseased were purchased and killed. Many obstacles were encountered and the disease evidently kept smouldering during 1900. In 1901 the infection appeared with increased vigor, this time in the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations in South Dakota in addition to Northern Nebraska. More stringent measures were inau - gurated to control the spread of the disease. In 1902 ten stallions and seventy-six mares were purchased and slaughtered. In 1903 five hun - dred and eleven were found diseased and were killed. In 1905 only one stallion and eight mares were found suspicious and destroyed. Since that time we have been practically free from Dourine, but last year one stallion brought into this State from Iowa was found to be affected with this disease and was therefore purchased by the Federal Govern - ment and destroyed. I An outbreak has recently (June, 1911) been located in Taylor nty, Iowa, where four stallions have been found affected and five wed to the disease. One of the former stallions has since died of infection. In addition, five mares have shown symptoms of Dourine. of which subsequently died of the disease, nine are suspicious rases, ninety-four have been exposed, but at present show no evidence of rtion. These diseased animals, together with all exposed stallions mares, were immediately quarantined by the State. Those show - lesions of the disease were purchased by the Government and de - yed, while the exposed animals are still in quarantine under ob - ation. fail-*-. I Many widely different theories as to the exact cause of this affec - have existed and been advocated in the past fifty years. It was until 1896 that the true cause of the malady was discovered by ;et, but his work was neither credited nor confirmed until 1899. its time two French Army Officers, Schneider and Buffard, proved trypanoBomes were associated in causal relation to the disease, uccessful inoculations of animals with organisms from an Infected ion. Later, Nocard verified there results, and subsequently, In , Laveran and Mesnil carefully described the trypanosome, naming rypanosoma Rougeti after its discoverer, although it had been ed by Doflein, Trypanosoma equlperdum. Symptoms. There are many variations in the symptoms of Dourine, and this </seg>
            <seg id="p017">16 Iirticularly true of the disease as it occurs in this country. In order ive a fair idea of the "symptom complex" it will be necessary to ribe manifestations which may appear in a number of horses, it be - undei*8tood that each individual may have several but not all of symptoms enumerated. Two distinct stages may be noted which somewhat from those described in textbooks, but probably no e than could be expected when differences of climatic conditions methods of handling are taken into consideration. The first stage chiefly concerns the sexual organs, and therefore differs somewhat in the male and female. In the second stage symptoms indicating an affection of the nervous system are more prominent and are not dependent on the sex of the animal. Following a variable period of incubation of from eight days to two months, there is seen in the stallion an irritation and swelling about the penis first noticed in the glands. This swelling extends throughout the organ, and the penis may be continually protruded and frequent erections noticed. The edematous swelling also involves the groin, with enlargement of the adjacent inguinal glands, and extends forward along the abdomen. In a few days small vesicles or blisters appear on the penis, which break, discharge a yellowish serous fluid, and leaving irregular raw ulcers. The ulrerative process may form a wound extending almost around the penis. The ulcers show a tendency to heal rapidly, leaving white cicatrices or scars which are permanent. In some cases the Urinary Meatus is very red and swollen, and according to some observers, especially European, more or less of a thick catarr - hal exudate is discharged from its orifice. This condition, however, has been rarely seen in this country, a more or less continuous drip - ping from the urethra of a yellowish, serouslike discharge alone being present. The stallion retains his full genesic instinct and becomes very amorous when brought in the vicinity of mares. If allowed ac - cefs to mares in season, service is often impossible, due to the fact that a complete erection of the penis does not occur. The testicles may be Involved and tender to pressure, and abscess formation may occur, with sloughing. In the mare the disease being the result of copulation, begins with ■welling and inflammation of the vulva and vagina. The labia are continually everted, exposing the clitoris, which constantly is in a state of erection. There will also be a muco-purulent discharge like that coming from the penis of the male, which may be slight or profuse in quantity, agglutinating the hair of the tail. The mare will switch the tall, appear uneasy, and urinate frequently. Shortly pepules and ves - icles appear on the external vulvu, as well as on the mucosa of the vulva and vagina. These vesicles soon rupture, but before doing so the contents undergo a change from a transparent to a purulent fluid. The rupture of these pustules is the initial stage in the formation of deep, angry ulcers. These ulcers show a tendency to heal rapidly, but invar - iably leave a cicatrix, which is permanent, causing a slight puckering of the tissue. On the dark skin of the external vulva the scars will always </seg>

Bimilar to the depression in a pockmark. depigmentation of the skin about the external genitals, due to heal - of the ulcer, is permanent and not temporary, as in coital exan - la and other affections simulating it. Edematous infiltration of perineum and the mammary gland frequently occurs. I The nervous or constitutional disturbances of the second stage not come on for months or even a year after the appearance of the lesions, and are similar in both male and female. They consist general nervous disorder with staggering, swaying gait, especially e hind limbs. The animal becomes extremely emaciated, particu - in the hind quarters., and the abdomen assume a "tucked up" arance. (See PI. Ill, fig. I.) The first indication of paralysis will be noted in traveling, when the animal fails to pick up one of the hind feet as freely as the other. There is a tendency to drag the foot partially, which will wear off the toe more than normal. This condition may shift from one hind foot to the other, or both may become affected simultaneously, at which time knuckling is a common symptom. (See PI. Ill, fig. 2) Only occasionally are the nerves of the front extremities and the face affected, the latter finding expression in paralysis of an ear, eyelid, nostril, or lip. ((See PI. IV, fig. 1) Urticarial eruptions or plaques may break out over various parts of the body. These swellings, which prior to the recent Iowa outbreak has been observed in only a few cases in this country, disappear in a few days, only to reappear at some other point. They are sharply defined, round, flat, edematous infil - trations of the papillary layer of the skin, about the size of a half dollar, or may be even larger. Some have a depressed center and an elevated periphery. When punctured a bloody serum exudes from - the cut surface. The usual locations of these qlaques are the croup, belly, and neck. (See PI. V. and PI. II, figs. 1 and 2.) White spots appear on the hind legs and in the region of the perineum, as a result of the discharge from the penis and vagina coming in contact with and causing a depigmentation of the integument. (See PI. IV, fig. 2.) The temperature of the animal seldom goes above 101° or 102" F. Labored breathing is occasionally noted. When the paralysis of the hind legs starts to appear, it usually progresses rapidly, the horse goes down, is unable to rise, and dies in a short time from nervous exhaustion. I'p to the last, however, the appetite remains good, and the stallion will show a desire for the mare, although service is impossible, as the horse can neither get a complete erection nor raise himself on his hind legs. Course of the Disease: It will be seen from the symptoms, that the course is extremely variable, and may cover a period ranging from nine months to two years. This course is markedly influenced by the condition and environment to which the animal has been subjected. Bad weather, exposure, insufficient food, and complicated diseases like Influenza, distemper, or in fact any condition which tends to lower </seg>

In order to avoid a misunderstanding or misconstruction of what has been here stated under the term "Urethral Gleet," it may be mentioned that an animal may suffer froifi an acute inflammation of these organs due to physical violence or injury, such as the intro - duction of a rough catherer, passing a cystic orall calculi, gravel or stones from the bladder or kidneys, or by being kicked; this may produce a discharge from the urethra for a short time, but as soon as the inflammation subsides the discharge would cease and a normal condition would follow, because in these cases no specific infec - tious agents are present. It should also be understood that the condition known as Coital Exanthema in which there may be a discharge from the urethra for a period of about ten or fifteen days, should not be .called Urethral i so far as this term is concerned in the stallion inspection law of Nebraska. Coital Exanthema is an acute infectious disease of the sexual organs of stallions and mares transmitted by sexual intercourse, but this disease is nearly always of a mild type and generally runs its course in about fifteen days and leaves the animal with no serious consequences. The period of incubation of this disease varies from one to six days. I The symptoms of Coital Exanthema are sometimes difficult to ?rentiate from the symptoms of Dourine, especially during the rative stage of the Exanthema. In Coital Exanthema the first ptoms generally appear in four or five days in the form of swelling tenderness of the part affected, followed by the formation of pap - , gradually passing into vesicles, postules, and scabs which scale and leave a white depigmented surface. The differential diagnosis is made less difficult where the history of the case can be obtained, as the period of incubation In Coital Exanthema is shorter, does not cause abortion, nor terminate in paralysis. KKCTRKKXT OPTHALMIA OH MOOXBLIXDXESS. By Dr. J. H. Gain, Lincoln, Xeb. An inflammatory affection of the interior of the eye, recurring at fairly uniform intervals and usually ending in blindness. ■ The term "Moonblindnees" probably came from the belief that periods of recurrence followed the changes of the moon. § Heredity must be considered the most potent cause. Low, poorly &gt;ed soils tend to develop the disease, while horses raised in a altitude are seldom affected. Overwork during the dentition </seg>
            <seg id="p026">25 period of the young animal or extreme loss of blood from hemorrhage may also be a contributing cause. There are numerous records of the appearance of the disease in alternate generations; the stallion by a blind sire remaining sound, but himself being the sire of numerous foals which developed the disease. »The hereditary tendency is so pronounced that at the Govern - : studs in France not only is every stallion thus diseased rejected, the service of the sound stallion is refused to mares that have this affection. The symptoms vary some what depending upon the individual. The first symptom noticed will be tears from the eye, the lids being kept partly or entirely closed. The pupil is contracted and the eye presents a bluish appearance with a slight milky deposit in the lower border. This lasts from five to seven days when the eye begins to clear, reaching its normal appearance in a week or ten days. The recurrence of all of these symptoms usually follow at intervals of a month or more, varying somewhat, some cases having periods of clearness of several months in the early stages. These attacks gradu - ally grow in severity, resulting in total blindness of the eye affected. Usually but one eye is affected, but the other soon becomes involved. In some cases there may be two or three attacks before there is much change in the appearance of the eye during the periods of clearness. Then there is a bluish color shown, giving rise at this time to the term "blue eye." It appears smaller than its fellow, being retracted somewhat and soon begins to atrophy. There is no treatment that can be suggested, except that Iumane measure the eyes should be kept covered with a piece thin black cloth during the acute stage, as the light at this ; is extremely irritating. Cataract. A common result of recurrent opthalmia resulting in any change in the lens or its capsule, making it less transparent. Bin rare cases it may be the result of an injury. It is often in very old horses and dogs as well as the human family, and is known as senile cataract. §This trouble should be suspected whenever the horse suddenly the habit of shying, or begins to turn his ears one forward the other back. These cases invariably result in blindness. Aniaurosis, Paralysis of the Optic Nerve. Blindness without any visible changes in the structure of the eye. This may appear temporarily from the reflection from snow, from an overloaded stomach or from poisoning. In these cases the attacks come suddenly and with proper treatment recovery is rapid.

The term sidebone is applied to a condition in which the lateral cartilages found on the wings of the coffin bone become partly or entire - ly oss-ified, that is, changed to bony matter by the deposition within them of lime salts.

They are often seen in connection with navicular disease, ringbones, contracted heels, and occasionally as a sequel to founder. Symptoms. These vary according to whether one or both cartilages are affected. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">28 B Expansion of the hoof is always diminished and later there is contraction of the wall or the quarter of the afflicted side. Sidebones produce a clumsy constrained action and at times mark - ed lameness which is aggravated on hard, rough roads, by allowing the hoofs to become dry and by using high calkins. When walking weight is chiefly borne by the toe, which is put to the ground first, the animal stepping as lightly as possible on the back part of the foot. In case both feet are affected the gait is stiff and the animal takes short steps and inspection of the shoe will show most wear over the dis - eased quarter. On palpitation or inspection the seat of lameness it readily recognized when ossification is complete which then feels hard. To test elasticity of cartilage the foot is raised, the thumb placed on the inside and outside quarter respectively and the other fingers rest - ing against the upper borders of the cartilages, pull them in an outward direction. This will enable one to detect the difference in the elasti - city of the cartilages. The test however, is of no value when the lower portion of the cartilages is ossified and the diagnosis then often becomes uncertain. Treatment. Treatment consists in resting the horse, removing the shoes, thin - ning the wall over the affected cartilage and applying cold poultices. When lameness subsides the animal should be shod by a good horee - si.oer and under the direction of a competent veterinarian. Should lameness again appear and persist, puncture firing with two or three months rest or neurotomy may be resorted to, the latter being the treatment most recommended. 1 Animals suffering from this disease very extensively should not be for breeding purposes unless the trouble is known to have orig - ■d from an accident, because the fact that a predisposition to op sidebones may be inherited. RINGBONE. Definition. KA ringbone is an exostosis or the growth of a bony enlargement on coronet and the large or small pastern bones, as the result of an immatory action set up in the periosteum or bone tissue proper. I A ringbone is classified according to its location as high, middle, or the latter being located near the superior border of the hoof, the le close to the pastern joint, and the high ringbone quite close to &lt;la&gt;s. </seg>

A few characters are, however, common to all the forms of these diseases, they are their usual spontaneous appearance, their point of origin in the heel and inflammatory nature. »They may be divided into four varieties. The first is an Erythe - ma, which is usually the form which precedes all the others, and is mildest form of dermatitis I inflamation of the skin) being com - &gt;st in horses with thin, fine skin.

I The unpigmented or white skin appears red, swollen and quite tul but after a few days ordinarily disappears if the cause it ived, producing no permanent injury and only occasionally requir - special treatment. When, however, the condition is neglected the horse continues to work, this form of dermatitis may give to the one next in order. DERMATITIS EXAXTHKMATOSA, ECZEMA, "MUD-FEVER." IThe inflamation appears spontaneously, is ushered in with swelling redness which may not be noticed until papules and vessicles (small ders) are formed, which rupture and allows a serous fluid to escape. t Lameness is then observed, especially when the animal is first id. Exudation becomes more profuse until the skin is covered with lowish red fluid, which soon dries and forms a brownish crust, crust soon loosens under proper treatment and if the horse owed to rest, disquamation follows revealing the normal skin. KThe course of this disease is from eight to fourteen days and ends &gt;mplete recovery, unless complications develop due to improper ment or not allowing the animal sufficient rest.

            <seg id="p035">34 ANNUAL REPORT This disease occurs in solipeds particularly during winter and is oftenest seen in large towns, its commonest and simplist form being known as "cracked heel." Symptoms and Course, Cracked heels generally appear suddenly, sometimes over night. K There is severe lameness in one or other limb with inflammatory ings of its lower portions and ;n gome cases extending to the upper Fever is usually present, from one to three degrees. On close examination of the affected parts a portion of skin one to two inches in diameter will be found to be swollen and soft. Pressure over this spot produces severe pain and the discharge of a reddish, turbid fluid. The conditions continue to increase in severity, pain becomes more intense, limb increases in size and in three or four days the dead skin is cast off as a gray, shiny mass, leaving a wound which, if properly treated, heals by granulation in a couple of weeks. tVery frequently the disease does not take such a favorable course. -ially is this true if it has been neglected and improperly taken of during its early stages, when sometimes the gangrenous inflam - on extends into the deeper structures of the foot involving the al cartilages, or coronet bone or penetrates into the sheath of the r tendons; in the first, sidebones results and in the second, ring - ■ may form. In cases where the tendon sheath becomes extensively involved, death may result from generalized infection. It will be observed from the foregoing that the important changes which a condition that at first may not appear to amount to very much, may develop, are of such a serious nature that if the ordinary prophy - lactic as well as curative measures which the owner may be familiar with, together with those which will be mentioned under a general head - ing, proves inefficient to check the disease process, competent veter - inarian services should be employed before the disease has advanced to such a stage that it may prove incurable or leave the animal badly blemished. DERMATITIS VKRVCOftA C'HROXICA, THE VERCCOSE ("WARTY") FORM OF DERMATITIS. "GREASE." This is the fourth form of dermatitis of the fetlock region which is "grease" proper. » Grease is always preceded by the first or Erythematous form when is not developed as a sequel to the second or Eczematous form, and condition is always chronic and progressive. 1 Originating in the fetlock region the process gradually spreads in some cases it extends upwards to the hock and knee Joints, in - ng thin flexor surfaces. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">35 tAt first there is usually a stiffness of gait which disappears during ise and the same symptoms that were mentioned under the second ;zematous form prevail, but instead of the discharge drying up i crust it becomes thicker, more grayish in color and very fetid. ■ The fetor of the discharge attracts attention to the parts whenever enters the stable, and the swollen pastern and wet matted hair show the exact location of the malady. I As the disease advances the tense skin cracks open, leaving open '8 from which bloody growths appear resembling large warts, which sometimes termed "grapes." The hair is shed and the parts ear as a mass of Irregularly rounded red excrescenses which bleed landling and are covered with a repulsive, fetid decomposing dis - ge. »This condition may also extend downward involving the frog and the horn becomes soft, whitish and fleshy in aspect, losing its nat - cohesive firmness until finally it sloughs away. General Causes. 1 Coarse legged horses with long thick hair on their fetlocks, as well ose having a heavy lymphatic constitution, suffer most extensively, are therefore, predisposing. Causes. I The more direct causes are overfeeding on grain, unwholesome ler, close, hot, dirty stables, frequent contact with dung, urine and - emanations, working in deep, irritating mud, especially in locali - where there are salt-works and where limestone is prevalent, irrita - by sandy dust in dry weather on dirt roads, exposure to intense . as the direct rays of the sun for a long time or to intense cold, • and icy mud. I In cities where salt is used to keep ice from forming on walks and tracks the resulting slush is a very important causative factor, wash - the legs with cold water, using strongly alkaline soaps and not dry - them properly, wrapping the wet legs with bandages which soak the and renders it more sensitive when exposed the next day. Other causes are injuries, such as rope burns and lacerations pro - duced by ice, poor circulation due to weak heart, supervening overwork, imperfect nourishment, lack of sunshine and impure air, chronic exhausting or debilitating diseases or diseased condition of the heart, liver or kidneys. These last causing dropsical swellings (stocking) of the limbs, ■which weaken the parts and induce cracking. Finally a very important factor to consider is the very favorable location for diseased germs to gain entrance, which they usually successfully do, increasing the inflam - matory conditions by their irritating poisonous products and the pus which most of them form. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">36 General Treatment. 1 Prophylaxis consists in carefully observing that proper sanitary lions exist around the animals and not compelling them to endure tions which have been enumerated under General Causes. An excellent method of drying as well as cleaning the legs of horses that are driven in rain and mud, is to rub them freely after their day's work, with clean pine saw dust. If the mud is dry warm water without soap should be used freely then followed by the use of the saw- In cases where the disease has commenced, the primary thing to do is to ascertain the cause and remove it, then allow complete rest in a clean stall. Should the condition be in the first or Brythematous stage, nothing else need ordinarily be done. When, however, the second or Eczematous form has developed the parts should be thoroughly cleansed, carefully observing that the folds of the skin and fissures do not contain filth and irritating secretions. For this purpose, warm water to which a mild disinfectant has been added and a neutral soap should be used, which, if fololwed by the liberal application of some good astringent healing powder, usually overcomes the trouble in from eight to four - teen days, if in its early stages. After the preliminary washing and disinfection it is very important to not again wet the parts. The other forms are too complicated and too varied for one to try and outline any treatment which could be successfully applied to all cases by anyone rxrept a competent veterinarian and he, upon being consulted, will be in a position to know by a thorough examination the conditions as they exist and treat them accordinly.

            <seg id="p038">37 THE HOCK. By Dr. John I&gt;. Spraijue. David City, Nebraska ■ The region commonly spoken of as the "Hock" la that portion of hind legs included between the inferior extremity of the Tibia, or thigh bone," and the superior extremity of the Meta Tarsal, or "shin The bones of the hock proper are usually six in number and are SMALL BOSK SPAVIN. i,nged in two layers; the first layer resting upon the head of the shin ea, and supporting the other layer, consisting of two- bones, one of ch articulates with the thigh bone, forming the true joint, and the &gt;r, called the Os Calais, occupying the posterior part of the joint, r.ds upwards to form what is frequently spoken of as the "point of hock." The purpose of having the bony structure of the joint made up of several pieces It for the lessening or distribution of concussion. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">38 The various bones have their contact surfaces covered with carti - lage, and are held together by short ligaments. Inclosing the true Joint we find a capsule of ligamentus tissue, inside of which is a mem - brane secreting synovia, or joint oil, for the lubrication of the joint. And it might be mentioned here that almost all of the unaound - cesaes of this region are due directly to either concussion, strain, or bruising of some of the structures mentioned. But there are other causes which act indirectly, and which may be classed as predisposing causes. They are, "heredity" and "conformation." More unsoundneases LARGE BONE SPAVIN. of the hock are due to faulty conformation than to any other cause. What position heredity occupies as a cause of unsoundness, is impossible to ascertain, but the fact that a great many of the hocks of faulty conformation seem to be inherited, is sufficient reason for believing it to be a very potent cause. ■ It is most difficult to estimate what per cent of unsoundnesses are to heredity, as the effect of such may not be seen before the second. </seg>
            <seg id="p040">39 iren the third generation. But the hock ot faulty conformation, the t hock, and the hock of poor quality each contribute their share of »se and unsoundness. So important do authorities on horse judging ider the conformation of the hock, that they allow it eight points of a possible 100, in their scale for judging; more than double the ber of points allowed any other joint. Whether the animal be used for speed, under the saddle, or for draft purposes, there is no other joint of the entire body subjected to so constant and severe strain as the hock. It is the joint upon which the great force of the entire muscles of propulsion are expended. When the horse is standing squarely, the hock should have an angle of from 140 to 145 degrees; should appear of good width when viewed from the side, and should not appear at all meaty or puffy to the touch. The head of the shin bone and the layer of small bones resting thereon should be well developed in order to furnish a good foundation for the joint. Without this developement the leg will be narrow and present the "tied in" appearance below the joint. The posterior line, from the point of the hock down, should be perfectly straight. If it is not straight, it is usually due to the upper end of the bone forming the "point of the hock" being drawn forward, causing a slightly rounded appearance at the lower part of the joint, and constituting what is known as a "curb" formation. "Curby" conformation and the "tied in" appear - ance are usually associated. But while it is desirous to have the bones of the joint well developed, yet the joint should not appear rough or coarse, as such indicates lack of quality. The most common diseases of the hock are Bone Spavin, Bog Spavin, Thoropin, and Curb. K'Bone Spavin" is an exostosis or bony enlargement, usually appear - pon the internal aspect of the inferior part of the joint, resulting an inflammatory condition produced by some of the various causes ly mentioned. The lameness resulting from "bone spavin" is usually quite char - acteristic; it usually grows less with exercise, and again increases after allowing the animal to stand. The severity of the lameness is not always In proportion to the size of the enlargement; in fact it may disappear entirely after the enlargement has attained considerable size. This fact accounts for the confusion sometimes encountered in an examina - tion for soundness. An animal might have a very small enlargement on each hock, without apparent lameness, and in such case it might be difficult to say whether the appearance is due to a squareness or coarseness in conformation or to the result of.an inflammatory condition. Again the animal might have a squareness or coarseness in the hock of one leg, and show some lameness in the opposite; in such case if the lameness be characteristic of spavin, you would be justified in suspect - ing a spavin developing on the smooth leg. "Bog Spavin" is a chronic inflammation of the synovial apparatus </seg>
            <seg id="p041">40 of the true joint, and is characterized by constant lameness, and a puffed or distended condition of the capsule of the joint. »"Thoropin" is a very similar condition, but the distention or puff the posterior part of the joint; and can be seen and felt upon both nside and outside of the leg; in fact, appears to extend through the Bog spavin and thoropin are most always associated. K'Hjrdrmrdthi-otiiK" of the hock is a condition resembling Bog Spavin pearance very much. But while there is a distention of the cap - of the joint, there is no lameness and there seems to be an absence lammation. The distention of the capsule is produced by a hyper - tion of synovia of an abnormal character. It is thought to be due atonic condition of the synovial apparatus; and is one of the pre - eing causes of Bog Spavin. It is a condition very common to some e draft breeds; and is most frequently found in young animals, a hocks that are too crooked. "Curb" is an enlargement situated upon the posterior aspect of the leg, at the inferior part of the hock, and is produced by a strain of the ligament which binds the "Os Calais," or the bone that forms the "point of the hock," to the bones beneath. This ligament acis very much as a truss, in holding the os calsis in an upright position, and when undue pressure is exerted upon the point of the hock, the upper extremity of the bone is liable to be pulled forward, and the ligament strained. The results of the strain are inflammation of the parts, and lameness. The lameness is usually very severe, but passes off as the inflammation sub - sides. The enlargement left is a result of the inflammation. Curb is nearly always produced by an over exertion of the animal, as in getting through mudholes, or by the horse slipping with the foot under himself. But the great predisposing cause of curb, is "curby conformation." But what is most interesting to the average horse owner is, what effect the various unsoundnesses have upon the utility, and the market value of the animal. An animal suffering from either Bog or Bone Spavin has his utility very much impaired, as he cannot travel so well nor draw the load so easily. He is in constant pain, as evidenced by his drawn or tucked-up appearance, and the loss of flesh. And his market value is practically nothing. If the lameness has been relieved, the animal may be practically as serviceable as before; but there is usually some little stiffness or lack of suppleness in the part and the commer - cial value is lessened by the fear that what produced a spavin on one leg might also produce one on the other. With Curb it is a little different; the usefulness of the animal is only interfered with until the inflammatory condition has been relieved and the parts, with the exception of being enlarged, have resumed their normal state. After recovering from curb lameness the leg is as strong, or stronger, than before. But it leaves the leg blemished and lessens the market value. As to animals kept for breeding purposes, the rule, "never use as </seg>
            <seg id="p042">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 41 animal with a defective hock," should be adopted. That doe* not mean that every horse having a blemished hock should be rejected, for the most perfect hock under the proper circumstances, might become blem - ished. And an animal with a well formed hock, though having a curb, would be preferable to one posessing a hock of curby conformation, though not having a curb. tMany producers of horses wonder why buyers raise so much objec - to slight defects in conformation, and blemishes, when they inter - so little with the usefulness of the animal upon the farm. The in is very plain; it is because the man to whom he sells, his buyer, b still greater objection to them. Horses with such may last a time at country work, but when subjected to daily and severe work paved streets, soon become unsound and incapacitated for the work rhich they were purchased. And in a large per cent of cases the undness is either Bone or Bog Spavin. In order to produce horses that will bring the best price on the market, and be the most suitable for home use as well, it is necessary to produce animals not having the tendency to become unsound. And to produce animals without that tendency, means to produce animals of pood conformation, and in order to produce animals of good conforma - tion, sires and dams with good conformation must be used. SKIUOIS DKFKCTS IX GENERAL CONFORMATION. By Dr. J. C. Bowman, Tecumseh, Nebraska. EThis subject is entirely too broad to cover in a few words. It is upon which volumes could be written, as it covers all different Is, types, and classes of horses. In the few remarks to follow, I outline what I think to be of the most importance to the general c. First — The causes of serious defects in general conformation are invariably due to heredity or are transmitted. That is to say, "like be - gets like." If you breed to inferior horses you will raise inferior ones. The offspring of a blemished horse does not inherit the blemish but it does inherit from its ancestors a weak eye, or hock as the case might be, or what ever other weakness its ancestors may have. For this reason it can be said that the cause of serious defects in conformation Is due to man. Instead of breeding away from tiiese defects we have saved every pure-bred of every type and breed. Unsound and low grade stallions are breeding at least twenty per cent of the maree in Nebraska, and we are still using them instead of disposing of them by castration M we should do. I refer to the unsound stallion, especially for if we breed nothing but sound and well bred individuals we will soon over - come most of the defects that are prevalent today. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">42 ANNUAL REPORT Second — I shall try to point out to you those conditions which constitute serious defects in conformation, taking the draft horse as an example. Beginning at the head, observe a small black or bluish eye, a small vicious head, narrow between the front legs, calf-kneed, straight up and down on the shoulder, straight on his pastern joints, small around the heart, cut up in flank, too long in back, hip too short and croup drops off too abrupt, crooked hind legs, too tall — from 16 to 17 hands is tall enough unless he is an unusually large horse. Unsound horses are always rejected in first class shows. I Third — Heredity and transmissible unsoundness and diseases, offspring inherits and the ancestor transmits. As I have men - ed the offspring inherits a weakness in that particular part of the omy, in which its ancestor is weak. The diseases most frequently smissable in the horse are: Periodic opt halm ia (or moon blind - ), laryngeal hemiplegia (or roaring), and melanosis. Those lundnesses most liable to follow serious defects in conformation sidebones, ringbones, curbs, bog spavins and thoroughpins. I do not mean to say that the draft horse alone is subject to these diseases and blemishes, for all breeds and types are equally subject to them. I might say sidebones are seldom found on light harness horses. Draft horses are more susceptible to them than the lighter THK ARTIFICIAL IMPREGNATION OF MARES. By Professor G. L. Carlson, Norfolk, Nebraska. One occasionally meets a man who is so wanting in the spirit of progress that he objects to anything new. Such men are frequently heard to say that "the old way is the best." If the "old way" is best, «e had better go back to the time when railroads, telephones and other public conveniences were unknown; to the time when farmers sowed their grain by hand, and harvested it with a hand sickle. Fortunately for the country at large, the greater part of the American people believe In progress, and are desirous of availing themselves of the benefit to be derived from every progressive practice which can be applied to the work of the farm or breeding barn. tThe things to be gained by the capsule or artificial impregnation of es are many chief among them being the conservation of the energies virility of the stallion. By this method of breeding a good stallion be used to impregnate a large number of mares, and this he can do i the minimum number of services. The "old way" usually means abuse of the stallion, for every breeder knows of stallions that are 1 to the extent of making from two to five services in a day. No lion can thus be abused without impairing his virility. While many mares can be impregnated with the capsule that can- </seg>

Then there are many mares that become more or less acid as a </seg>
            <seg id="p045">44 ilt of vaginal secretions. Acids will destroy the life of spermatozoa quickly, but if the fluid can be carried forward and deposited in the as without coming in contact with the acid secretions found in the iia of the mare, another cause of barrenness will be overcome. In •rger number of mares that are found acid in the vagina, the uterus be found in a normal condition. t Nature intended under natural conditions that copulation would t in depositing; the flui'. directly into the uterus, but under domestic tions the fluid is frequently deposited in the vagina. This is the t of services being made with animals when controlled by man, in El different manner than when these same animals are controlled eir instincts. For instance, when horses are running out in a al manner, as in a pasture or upon the range, much time is given iting in the way of preparation for the act. The stallion takes, plenty of time in making the mare ready and willing, the result being that the mare responds to the copulative act in relaxing the muscles of the cervix, making the injection of the semen into the uterus not only possible, but easy. I'nder conditions of domestication the stallion soon learns that the bridle and presence of a mare means something for him to do, causing him to become impetuous and rough. The mare is frightened and nervous because of the stallion being strange to her and the entire process which follows, a strange one and unnatural. This nervousness and fright on the part of the mare results in her taking no part in the copulative act, and the muscles of the cervix are constricted so tightly that no fluid can pass through, and the fluid is deposited in the vagina. Because of the difference in temperaments, draft stallions are more inclined to make perfect services than warm bred ones, and </seg>
            <seg id="p046">STAL,LION REGISTRATION EOA1U&gt; 45 fa more so than either. In the use of the capsule a perfect service be made every time, a perfect service meaning one where the fluid been deposited in the uterus. Figure I. in this article will explain the relative positions of the genital organs of the mare better than words can do. 1 and 2 are the ovaries; 3 and 4 the horns of the uterus; 5 body of the uterus; 6 fall - opian tube; T cervix, or neck of the uterus; 8 vagina; 9 meatus urin - arius, through which the urine is voided; 10 clitoris, or female penis; 11 and 12 broad ligaments, by which the genital organs are suspended in their normal position. t Figure II. represents an egg (ovum) of the mare, a photo-micro - h magnified several diameters. Breeders sometimes imagine that ire is impregnated at the time of the service, and that the stallion something to do with the act of fertilization, both premises, how - . being in error. When the egg is discharged from the ovary it is FIG. III. Iiered up by the fumbria at the orifice of the fallopian tube and ed backward through this tube to a small narrow portion of it near horn of the uterus, where it remains for several days until It is met a spermatozoon and fertilized. The minute size of spermatozoa ler their movements very slow — not much more that an inch per r — so that some time must elapse between their introduction into uterus and the time when the fertilization of the egg can take place. &gt; also shows conclusively that the stallion or jack can in no manner to hasten, the fertilizing process. The essential thing being the oduction into the uterus of fluid from a virile male. It matters not ther this fluid is introduced by the stallion, or by the act of man in g the capsule or instrument. Before taking up the beet method or methods of Introducing the semen into the uterus, it will be well to study the part the stallion plays in the impregnation of a mare. To do this one has only to study the functions of the male generative organs, their relations to one another. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">46 ANNUAL REPORT In the early days of horse breeding in this country very little thought was given to such things, and most breeders believed all that was necessary to do in order to increase the horse population of the country was to mate a stallion with a mare. Many believed then, and a few still entertain the same belief, that a stallion could be permitted to serve mares as often as he could make ready for service. The number of sterile stallions in the country resulting from such a practice is teach - ing us the folly of such things. Figure 111. represents the testicle of a stallion, and other organs, dissected of their serous covering. 1 is the testicle; 2 tubules contain - ing the spermatoblast cells in which spermatozoa originate; 3 vasa tig. iv. efferentia: 4 epididymis; 6 vas deferans; 7 spermatic artery. The tes - ticle Is inclosed with a fibrous capsule, the fibrous tissue extending into the substance of the testicle, dividing the organ into separate lobules. In each lobule are found many seminal tubules, commencing in a highly convoluted portion, but ending in a straight tube, and piercing the outer covering (tunica albuginea) of the testicle at its forward and upper extremity. These seminal tubules consist of several layers of cells, known as the spermatoblast cells, which form or originate spermatozoa. These may be seen at 2 in figure III. The first processes of the development of spermatozoa are by division, followed by the processes shown in figure IV. These latter processes are transitory, occuring in part while the spermatozoa </seg>
            <seg id="p048">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 47 are in transit from the testicle to the seminal vesicles located at the base of the bladder, and where they are stored for future use. By this process the male is always ready when needed, but it will be observed that the processes are the result of the action of nerves and cells so minute in their structure that they can be studied only by the aid of the microscope. These glands and cells are so delicate that any inflammation caused by their abuse in the way of excessive use, may be the means of converting a virile stallion into one more or less sterile. Any abuse of a stallion in the way of excessive service is quite sure to result in impairing his virility. The use of the capsule makes excessive service unnecessary. A fully developed spermatozoon, highly magni - fied, is shown at figure V. t Another frequent cause of the loss of virility in stallions is the use eeding bags. This practice is so unnatural and injurious that many ons refuse to serve mares when compelled to wear a breeding bag. ■ good stallions are ruined in this manner every year. The injury ie stallion first noticed is his failure to discharge semen, and in cases the total loss of the procreative power will be in evidence FIG. v. Kout former notice of any injury. The procreative act is made pot - by sex (magnetic) attraction, and any barrier interposed which non-conductor of electricity, such as rubber, will prove fully as bad lasturbation, and destroy the virility of any stallion. I There is no patent on the use of capsules, or other methods of arti - breeding; nor is the technical part of the practice a difficult one. Icial breeding can be successfully done by anyone of ordinary intel - ce. The essential things are cleanliness and keeping the semen uch as possible from light and changes of temperature. The direct of the sun will destroy the life of spermatozoa very quickly. The lal temperature is about 100 degrees. The air and everything we 1 is alive with bacteria in countless numbers. This makes it essen - that we exercise the greatest care in being cleanly. Briefly described the method consists of making a natural service </seg>
            <seg id="p049">48 by using a clean and healthy mare, then extracting the semen with an extractor made for this particular work. From the extractor capsules are filled and one inserted in each mare to be bred. By having the horse billed for a certain hour each day, the mares can all be on hand at the hour stated, and in a few minutes several mares can be bred with a single service of the horse. If but two mares are to be bred, the extractor may be used to transfer the semen from one mare to the other. In this way one service a day will suffice for serving any number of mares, and the stallion that is used in excess of this cannot be expected to render a very good account of himself. We have only to investigate the work of different stallions to be convinced of this. Many stallions making 200 services during a breeding season do not leave more than SO or 40 foals to show for all their efforts. This in itself should be enough to convince an intelligent man that something is wrong in our breeding practice. The most valuable service to the country in the use of the capsule, will be found in the greater safety from infection. There are many mares in all parts of the country suffering from infectious diseases. Some of these mares are being served by stallions, in which case every mare served by this stallion later, will add one more to the number of infected mares. Much of the barrenness among mares is of an infec - tious nature and the number of such mares is being increased every year by some stallion being permitted to serve them. A more general use of the capsule method of breeding would soon solve the problem of infectious barrenness. THE Ol'T-OK-SEASON CARE OF THE STALLION' By Professor Ellis Rail, University of Nebraska. Keeping a stallion is a business proposition. At least it should be, though for some men it is a poor business. If it is a business proposition, it should be handled as such, that is, effort and care should be taken to make it as certain and sure as it is possible to do. The greatest returns, and the time when a stallion is the busi - est is, of course, during the breeding season. Indeed, most stallioners expect nothing from the horse during the remainder of the year but additional cost and care of keeping. And because of this attitude, the horse is cared for in whatever way seems to take the least care, bother and expense. It is forgotten that the value of the horse during his three to four months of service as a breeder is largely dependent on his care during the other eight, and so poor handling and poor management creep in, and the business becomes a poor one, yielding unsatisfactory results, to say the least. ■ There are two principal points to be kept in mind in caring the stallion out of season. The first of these is that the value </seg>
            <seg id="p050">49 of the horse as a breeder depends upon whether or not he is in perfect health and in perfect physical condition during the season. The second is that the horse should be made, as nearly as possible to pay for his care and management during the eight months he is off the stand. It is poor business ethics to have a thousand to two thousand dollars invested in something that not only is making no returns on the investment during two-thirds of the year, but is also entailing additional expense during this time. ■ Referring now to the first point. The health and condition the horse will be in during the breeding season will depend to a very considerable degree on his being kept healthy during the remainder of the year. So in arranging for his care and management it should be kept in mind that two things should be done. First, he must have a suitable amount of desirable kinds of food, and second, he must have exercise enough to keep him in good hard physical condition. As to the amount of feed, that is a question to be settled for every individual horse. No horse should be kept hog fat or in high condition. But he should not become too thin either. So the amount of grain fed sohuld be enough to keep the animal in good flesh, and usually this will be in the neighborhood of a pound of grain per day for each hundred pounds weight. As to the exercise, he should have sufficient of that so that he is in good hard condition. The average stallion is as soft and mushy in the fall as is a steer ready for the market. The writer speaks from experience having had opportunity now for seven years to see scores of farmers' stallions during August, September and October. At this time of the year, most stallions will, if taken from their stalls and walked for fifteen minutes, lather and sweat excessively, also become very warm. Horses in such condition are entirely too soft and should have more exercise. As to the method of giving a horse sufficient exercise, there are several. One way which requires the least time and bother, but which is fairly satisfactory, is to provide a long, narrow paddock, in which the horse is kept rather than in a box stall. His stall should open directly into this paddock so that he may go inside when he chooses. Length in the paddock is the essential point so that the horse may run and extend himself. The corners should be rounded so he can not hurt himself by slipping into them, and the opening from the stall to the paddock should be Quite roomy, so he won't get hurt there. A second method of exer - cise is by giving road work of at least four miles per day. This is entirely satisfactory as far as keeping the horse in shape is con - cerned, but it is expensive as it requires the time of a groom for at least two hours per day, and in busy or rush times the horse is apt to be neglected; either he is not out at all, or his time is shortened up. But, as was said, no matter if well done, it is expensive. To our mind the practical method of exercising the stallion is to work him. Any stallion that is at all tractable can be made to work </seg>
            <seg id="p051">50 ANNUAL REPORT alongside another horse, though of course, a responsible man must be in charge. Light horses are more spirited and harder to manage than phlegmatic drafters. Yet every light stallion is broken to work and nearly all work double. Drafters can be worked just the same. Regular work provides the horse with exercise and keeps him in the best of health. Also, it is the least expensive. There is always use for a team on the farm, at least part of the day. If the stallion does his share he not only gets exercise, but he earns his keep as well. If the stallion does not work, his keep is extra and also the cost of his groom goes against his year's profits. Why should he not offset this by regular work at the same time getting the exercise that is absolutely necessary to bis good health and the main tenance to a full degree of his. breeding powers. He may be worked single as well as double. Indeed, if we were keeping a draft stallion we would have a heavy cart with thills, and the stallion would do all the hauling of feed and light loads as well as much other incidental and regular work. The stallion has size enough that he is able to handle quite a load, so that the idea of working him singly is quite feasable. Speaking now very briefly of the second point of importance in caring for the stallion, namely, that of economy, we have shown pretty well above what an economical plan is. It will cost at least Iindred dollars a year to feed a stallion, to say nothing of the ( of grooming and exercising him. If two hours per day are thus and he couldn't be properly cared for in less, another hundred krs worth of labor will have been added to the cost of his keep. &gt;w this time of exercising is spent in doing profitable work, and only that time but six to eight hours per day, the horse will have exercise, be in first class shape, and will have done a hum'i^i irs worth of work besides. Really then the working of the stal - will enable the owner to have practically all the service fees col - ■d as payments and profits on his investment. iThe only additional point we wish to suggest is that the stall e stallion should be kept scrupulously clean, and so should the !. He should be thoroughly cleaned every morning with a good i and cloth. If he comes to the stable warm and lathery, clean out then. It is an abomination to a horse to let him stand twen - ur hours all full of sweat and dirt. He feels just like a farmer d who went to bed without having cleansed himself after having ihed all day. So keep the horse clean. Avoid drugs or any nos - s. Feed little heating grain, but plenty of oats, bran, barley, s, and roots; not too much hay. It is unnecessary, and simply a tax on the digestive powers. Use common sense, horse sense, and remember that good hard, rugged health is to be the ideal condition to be maintained.

By Wayne Dinsmore, Sec'y, Chicago, 111. t Slowly but surely the Percheron breeders In the United State* following the trail laid out by American cattle breeders. Short - i, Herford and Angus breeders have brought their breeds to a tion in numbers and excellence, unexcelled in the world. Slight ress was made in cattle breeding until the number bred in this itry made selection possible; and the most rapid progress came ■ the breeds were well distributed and pure bred animals had me fairly easy to locate in the chief breeding districts. fin the past, the breeding of Percherons of the best possible has been retarded because of the limited number of breeding als from which selection could be made. The fact that the able animals were widely scattered over a vast area of territory further handicapped the work of constructive breeders. Selec - and assembling of the best females was impossible. These conditions still prevail in some degree, but much less than formerly. An analysis of the registrations of American bred ani - mals made between August 1st, 1910, and May 1st, 1912, has recently been completed by the Percheron Society of America. This covers most of the colts foaled in 1909 and 1910, some over age animals, and a few 1911 colts. 1 While it does not represent two full year's registrations, it does a very definite line on the distribution of Percheron mares, and the ion and relative importance of various breeding districts. tlllniois and Iowa contributed 50 per cent of the Percherons ded. Ohio, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana are the states next ne and together bred 22.8 per cent, of the animals recorded in time mentioned. Minnesota and Wisconsin follow closely and iuri takes an unexpectedly high rank, standing 9th. This is due le rapid development of draft horse breeding in the north half le state, where conditions are very similar to those prevailing e big six, or the corn belt states. The judgment of the most experienced buyers of draft horses for market purposes is to the effect that more good draft horses can be purchased in Iowa and Illinois than anywhere else in the United States. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that these states are older in draft horse breeding than any other, save Ohio. All experienced horsemen concede that the distribution of a number of pure bred mares of any draft breed in a locality results in hastening the introduction of better sires, for the owners of pure bred mares insist upon a first-class sire of the breed they are using. In numerous instances where stallion owners have declined to purchase better horses, they have of their own accord gone out and purchased good stallions, thereby forcing the local stallioners into the purchase of better sires. ■ The three leading states are those oldest in draft horse breed- Ohio was earliest with Percheron importations In 1851, but </seg>
            <seg id="p053">52 Ijis breeders purchased the greatest of the early sires — LOUIS OLEON — in 1856, and between that time and 1880 imported f times more Percherons than Ohio. Iowa breeders started with breed almost as soon as their co-laborers in Illinois and, like &gt;is, established a greater number of breeding centers than Ohio, • to 1880. From these three states, pioneers in draft horse breed - the spread has been gradual into adjoining states. It is a matter rprise that Indiana, lying midway between Illinois and Ohio, should made less progress in recent years than Kansas and Nebraska. Within the leading states, the breeding is centered chiefly in 10 or 12 counties. Illinois is breeding Percherons in 80 out of the total of 102 counties; Iowa in 96 out of 99; Ohio in 70 out of 87; Kansas in 72 out of 105, and Nebraska in 53 out of 92; Indiana in 67 out of 92. I Illinois and Iowa, the leading states, stand in marked contrast le particular. Most of the Percherons in Illinois are bunched iatively few counties, while in Iowa, they are distributed over ically the entire state. No county contributed over 7.2 per cent, ose bred in Iowa, while in Illinois the leading county, McLean, thed 15.8 per cent of all those bred in the state in the time con - ed. The first six counties in Illinois furnished 45 per cent. I bred in the state; the first six counties in Iowa but 35 per cent. The wide distribution of Percheron mares, already shown, means (re general demand for the best Percheron sires. The number en who own and are breeding Percherons, now in excess of active breeders, will inevitably hasten the production of better erons than have heretofore been bred in America. American •rs are excelled by none in the world in intelligence and skill eir live stock breeding operations and the work of so many minds cannot fail to bring a wonderful improvement in the within the next few years. 1 Careful selection of the best is now possible, although difficulty still be encountered on account of the area which must be covered taking selections. Success in breeding live stock is hard to win. This is particu - larly true in horse breeding. The development of Percheron breed - ing in the United States has been hampered by enemies of the breed, by division in the ranks of its supporters and by much hostile criticism from would-be authorities on breeding problems. These are incidents, history teaches us, in the development of every great breed of live stock and the steadiness and cool judgment displayed by Percheron breeders in surmounting all such difficulties have prob - ably never been excelled under similar circumstances. Percherons are today the most popular breed of draft horses in the world and far outnumber the other pure bred draft horses in the United State*. There has never been a time when the industry was on a firmer founda - tion, nor a better time for creative breeders to devote their best effort* to the development of better Percherons than the world has yet produced. </seg>

            <seg id="p121">120 The meeting was called to order by Hon. J. A. Ollis, Jr., of Ord, Nebraska, at Stock Judging Pavlllion, University Farm, at 9:15 o'clock a. m., who announced that owing to the long program it would be necessary to proceed with business. He thereupon delivered the following opening address: ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT J. A. OLLIS, JR. I We are gathered here to open the most important meeting to be in the state of Nebraska this year. The improved live stock ders of Nebraska constitute the largest element that had cou - ■d to the wonderful improvement that this great commonwealth made in the last few years. Not only has the wealth of the State ?ased at a heretofore unheard of rate, but the advance in everv of industry has been so great that it is necessary for one to stop ponder to realize what it means. I The Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders represent an in - try of vast proportions and one that requires great resources. In e naturally expect keen competition, and if we wish to succed we it study as well as work. It is not the man who puts in the great - number of hours at manual labor who is the most successful, but \ the one who labors and studies along intelligent and systematic It is just as necessary that you should have a balanced ration ■s It is for your animals. A proper amount of work, and a proper amount of study and research are indispensable to success. It is per - haps true that some of us are not so much in need of information r.s of a general waking up of our people to make the best use of the knowledge and talents we possess. We should have the determination to go forward and put forth the best there is in us. I The Improved Live Stock Breeders here assembled, and through - our state have had more to do with the general advancement of country than any other one class of people, and for this you Id be congratulated. However, I would not have you understand that the compara - tively few people gathered here are all that I include in this great claas, for the Improved Live Stock Breeders constitute a large and aggressive army; for it includes many of our leading bankers, mer - chants, business men. and especially our newspaper friends. It also includes those who are at home today — both men and women — who are devoting their time and attention to business that could not be neglected without great loss, for they are striving upon the farm and ranch to advance the cause of improved live stock. It is not always convenient for the farmer who is not blessed with an abundance of help to turn his stock out in the field to rustle and browse for itself and attend these meetings, but through our printed proceedings and the personal efforts of those present we trust they may get the good of this meeting. We sometimes get the mistaken idea that we are the </seg>
            <seg id="p122">121 patriots, and we are the people who make the sacrifice necessary to carry on this great work, and when we do we should disabuse our minds of it. I doubt if there is a single person within the reach of my voice today who cannot point to some of his friends at their homes who doubtless are making a greater sacrifice by remaining at home than we are by lending our presence. to this meeting, and who, in - cluding their wives, mothers, sisters and brothers, and employes, would be glad to be here if they could. I trust that every one present will do something to help make this meeting a success, by either asking questions, or giving valuable information, there-by benefitting not only those present, but the absent ones as well who shall read our proceedings, and our public In this connection I wish to say that I am proud of the news - papers of this state, for they have always been ready and willing to carry information to those who are unable to acquire it first hand. We are under many obligations to the press, and I cannot too strongly urge upon you to boost for them all the time. KI would also ask that you give us your individed attention to end that you shall absorb valuable information which you will be to disseminate throughout the various communities in which you thereby helping to build up and push forward this noble work. I The Improved Live Stock Breeders Association is in better con - on at the present time than ever before to do effectual work, as experience in the past has been felt throughout the state. Surely, have made an impression upon the people, for our organization the last year has been recognized by the state, and a sum of ley has been appropriated to defray necessary expenses. So none of this money has been expended except a small indebted - &gt; has been incurred for stationery and postage. One year ago K Society was incorporated, and now includes all the live stock iations combined in one, which is doing the special work that been done by those individual societies. Each society has a president in the Live Stock Breeders Association. All of these &gt;rs have been diligent in promoting the usefulness of the society fr as possible. They have advertised this meeting, and have pre - 1 a splendid program, and now this meeting is yours, and on my friends, depends the success or failure of this meeting, and if do your duty I bespeak wonderful success for this meeting. I see before me many men who own or are interested directly in pure bred stock, but if any of you have the idea that only pure bred breeders constitute the Improved Live Stock Breeders of Ne - braska, you are mistaken. Every man and woman in the state who is earnestly striving to improve his or her herd, or flock, is a live stock improver regardless of the methods along which he or she may be working. Just as much as the man who has his thousands invested in pure bred stock. And so I say those who are in a humble way striv- </seg>
            <seg id="p123">122 Kfor the improvement and the betterment of their conditions are backbone of this great industry. Th e success of the purebred der depends on the market value of his product, and it takes a munity of interest to achieve satisfactory results. I wish to appeal, not only to you, but to the citizens of this great Commonwealth to be alive to the opportunities that lie before you, and to realize that favorable circumstances await us at every hand, and if we wish to progress we must take a step in advance of the present movement. And by so doing you can pay the debt you owe your God and Creator who has enabled your lot to be cast in such convenient places, and where your responsibility is correspond - ingly increased. Therefore, I say, broaden out, grasp the advantages that are before you, and the problems of life, in the broadest sense, and put your heart and hand to the wheel you will have unbounded success. And so in closing I would suggest and recommend that you all commence this year with a determination to do better than last. Study your business, get acquainted with it. love it, and to you whose lot is cast among th e flocks and herds I say it is a happy lot. The one who loves the uncomplaining beasts of the field will find in them no mean company. Deceit, malice or envy do not abide in herd or flock. Someone has truly said, the business a man has is not simply his means of getting a living, but that he is a part of the world's work. Each human life is a tack, a nail, or a band of steel in the great machinery of the business of the world. When labor and thought are linked together in every phase of our lives we shall have less grit in the machine and more gold in the product, (applause) President Ollis: I have an announcement I wish to make. This afternoon the men's and students' judging contest will take place and I see that the rules provide that those entering this contest shall b« members of the Improved Live Stock Breeders Association. Any one may join the association by paying a membership fee of one dol - lar, and I believe that every one who does not belong should join the association whether they wish to enter the contest or not; so any wishing to join will pay a dollar and receive a receipt therefor, and as we have several receipt books here you need not be afraid of being turned down, as we will take care of all who seek admission. We have on our program this morning two numbers of great interest to all, and they will be discussed by men who we are proud tc have before us at this time. The first address is by a man who has been a practical horse feeder for a great many years, and a man who has made it 1 his life study, who has been very success - ful in that business, understanding it in all its details. He comes before you abundantly able to tell you the practical ideas in regard to feeding horses and their care, and breeding. They are matters that he has thoroughly tested and which he knows by actual ex - perience; so it is not theory but practice that he is going to give you. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 123 And before we begin I wish to say that if any time something is said that is not entirely clear to you you should feel free to ask auestions, as this meeting is for your good, and the speakers will answer them to the best of their ability. It is full and free discussion that we invite. Know take pleasure in introducing to you Mr. Frank Howard, wnee City, who will speak to us on the Feeding of the Draft for Market. (Applause.) THK FEEDING OF THE DRAFT HORSE FOR MARKET. By Mr. Frank Howard, Pawnee City. Mr. President and Gentlemen. tl exceedingly regret that the weather has not only injured our ness at home, but it has prevented a larger attendance upon meeting. Many horseman, cattlemen, and all kinds of stock men doing well to take care of their private affairs at home regardless neetings of this nature, however we feel grateful for this splen - audience and we trust you will all leave feeling well repaid for ng been here. Our topic this morning is Horses, and as I was leaving home last Sunday I hurriedly gathered up a few photographs which I thought might be of interest to you, and the first one I show you is entitled. "Six Percheron Blue Ribbon Geldings — Pabst Brewing Company." As you observe these horses are attached to a delivery wagon owned by the Pabst Brewing Company and are a very fine type of high bred horses. II am glad to see that the majority of our audience is young men. on the whole they are more apt and willing to accept new ideas, iften times the older ones are set in their methods of handling &gt;&lt;&gt;s and not inclined to take up with new improvements, but I will and interest you all and when I am through I will answer any stions you may ask to the best of my ability. tMy topic is feeding horses for the market. It is not in my line eak to an audience, as I have not trained myself to do it, so I merely content myself by giving you a plain horse talk as that permost in my mind. Sometimes my wife asks me to talk about s other than horses, but you all know a person is most apt to about those things that are nearest his heart, or those things enter into his daily life, and from which he derives a liveli- I have been engaged in the horse business about thirty-two years, and during that time it has had many ups and downs, but the greater part of this time the large draft horse, the horse that I want to impress upon your mind today, the horse that is large and hand - some, the horse that weighs from 1600 to 2200 pounds, and of which there is such a great shortage, is the horse that I wish to tell you </seg>
            <seg id="p125">124 ANNUAL REPORT Iethlng about. The up-to-date farmer and breeder is raising the draft horse, and when we see them we see something that is attrac- Feeding the draft horse for the market is a business much neg - lected In this the richest agricultural country in the world. This state is over 400 miles long and 240 miles wide, and we can raise anything the other states raise, and in addition thereto we can raise alfalfa galore. Illinois. Iowa and Missouri are considered fine states, but they have not made the success of alfalfa that we have in Ne - braska. Before entering upon my subject further I want to ask you all two questions. I want to see where we are at on the question of big draft horses. We have representativs here from the various parts of the state, and I would like to ask, how many of you know of half a dozen draft horses, I mean pure types of draft horses, that are low down, big bone, sound, good middle, ready tor the market, weighing from 1600 to 1900 pounds; all who know of half a dozen of that kind of first class horses ready for the market will please raise their hands. (No hands up.) I am sorry to say there is not even one hand up. Now, how many of you know of half a dozen little horses weighing from 900 to 1200 pounds, thin in flesh, of light build, and that will eat everything a man raises; how many of you Vnow of half a dozen in your county ready for the market please raise your hand. (All hands up.) I regret to announce that there are plenty of that kind. You see it is a one-sided matter, and at that on the wrong side. And now that I am on the best side of the argu - ment I can talk easier and with more confidence, something like a good lawyer arguing against a school boy. To emphasize the shortage of draft horses I will give you a little Illustration. The other day I went to the home of a small local dealer, and he had a few nice draft horses. We went to his barn and upon opening the door he started in by aaying he had the best ones in front, and he said, "Now, Mr. Howard, this one is sound and this one is sound," and so he went from horse to horse, and after he had shown me the last one he said: "that sounds like they are all sound, but there ain't any more like them in my neighborhood, and within five years I predict the people in this community will be doing their plowing with cattle." I thought at the time he was emphasizing it pretty strongly, but, gentlemen, we are coming to that condition unless we wake up and get busy. There is a shortage of first class horses in the country, and con - sequently a great demand. A friend of mine the other day said he had an outlet for a hundred head of good draft horses. These little horses — outclassed things — sell about like a lot of runty pigs. Let the fellow who thinks he is wise, but who really knows very little, raise that kind; but I hope it may not be said of any of you after yon go to your homes. Unless we improve our condition the saying of the small local dealer will come to pass. </seg>
            <seg id="p126">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 125 II will give $300 around for a bunch of truly good type draft s weighing from 1700 to 1900 pounds, but I do not at this time of one in my community for sale worth the money. I Now, Mr. horse raiser, and up-to-date farmer, I think you had ter get out your pencil and paper, and wake up, and begin to re a little and see if you cannot forecast a handsome profit. I &gt;w there are people who will try to argue against this, and tell you t in a few years there will be no more use for the horse, and that will be replaced by the automobile, but if you are wise you will 'egard such talk, for it will not be so. And I say to you frankly t if you will raise horses like this "Blue Ribbon" team I will pay :e $300 around for them. I now show you a photograph of some draft horses that I ship - ped to Chicago, and on which I made a handsome profit. I always thought considerable of them, as it was the first bunch of horses I finished and fed in this business, and I will pay $350 around for a bunch like them. I picked them up in my neighborhood, and as I said shipped them to Chicago, but as they reached a poor market I shipped them to Boston and Harris Brothers of that place sold them. Their average weight was 1760 pounds, and well built. There was a nice profit to me for feeding them, and a handsome profit to the man who raised them. But these little horses I spoke of a little while ago consume even more feed to fatten and when you do offer them for sale, they sell like a bunch of little runty pigs, for which there is little or no demand as the country is full of them. So I say, breed for the large ones, something of which you will be proud, and which will find a quick sale. II used to be a lover of the harness horse, and I now show you photograph of a harness team hitched to a buggy that I literally ihipped. It was the highest class pair of horses of their type in country, but I had to forget them, and today we have to look at Missouri mule or something like it to do the hard work. This ire of harness horses shows class, and knee action and are a high i pair of road horses, but today the up-to-date horse raiser, or up - ite farmer wants the heavy draft horse. I will in my humble way endeavor to give you my Idea as to breeding a draft horse, as the word draft horse means a great deal. Prof. Carlson who follows me will tell you more about It, and I am glad he is here to speak to you. He spoke to us last year, and he told ue: many valuable things, and you will all be greatly interested in his talk for when he tells you something it is worth carrying home and putting into actual use. I have been reading his paper, and if you would all read it I am sure you would know more about a marketable horse. But to get back to my subject. In the first place we should look to the dam — the mare to raise draft horses from,, for I think there is where the average horse raiser is lame. Do not think because you are breeding to a good draft stallion that any kind of a mare will raise a good colt. There is often a big draft stallion in a neighborhood and </seg>
            <seg id="p127">126 a number of small poorly bred mares, showing that they fall short in the dam. I consider that the type of mare to raise a truly draft horse from should be a mare that would weigh over 1500 pounds up to as large as they grow, and of good quality, low down, big bone, wide out and good middle and have all the qualifications of a pure type of draft mare. And when you have that type mare, with plenty of bone — good, flat, clean bone, you will get a foal that is worth something. Horse raisers, breeders of draft horses, do not be afraid of hav - ing good money invested in good brood mares to raise real draft horses from, as you cannot raise draft horses out of little, fine-boned piares. You may say you cannot afford to put $250 to $300 in a brood mare, but the people of rich Illinois. Ohio and Pennsylvania have them and they are not in as good position to raise and bleed them as you are out here in Nebraska. We can mature them and ship them to them in the east and make money on them, but still those eastern people think they can buy them and make money on them by raiting colts, so don't be afraid to invest your money in good draft mares, and keep the right type. And if you all do that we will soon see results and our trade with the eastern states will ma - terially increase. I Now a few words about the sire which is just as important as the Remember that like begets like, whether pure bred or scrub, stallion should be of the same type as the mare; they should be bone, low down, wide out and good middle and rugged in every and should weigh about a ton, for as a rule we fall short of ;ht in the dam. and to raise draft horses we must have the weight the bone. In fact he must have all the qualities that go to make ist class draft horse, and he must be able to transmit them to his eny. Coming up on the street car this morning I heard a young say that last spring he came up to the city to buy a stallion, and ad in his mind the kind, ty|:e and weight stallion he intended to but when he made the purchase they talked him into buying of inferior weight and type much to his disappointment later on. tarttd cut with g: o.l intentions and if he had insisted on getting t he wanted he would have been all right, and it would have been acentive to the seller to furnish that kind. As I before stated, do not get the notion that because the stal - lion is a high type draft horse that the mare can be of an inferior low grade stock, and by the combination get first-class colts. On the contrary you can look for disappointment under those conditions, for the mare might have bad blood in her, and you do not know how she is bred, and she might raise a very inferior colt out of a draft stal - lion, and thereby meet with disappointment, eo if you can get full blood marts with good, flat, clean bone, low down, you will be sur - prised at results. Horse buyers, when they start out to buy horses, generally have </seg>
            <seg id="p128">127 a system of looking over a horse, and this is not particularly true of the farmer or young man, who merely takes a cursory view of him. and never ask to have him unhitched, or if he have a saddle on ask to have it removed. The horse may be afflicted with one or more diseases and defects such as blindness, weak lungs or heart, or he may have a spavin, ringbone or sidebone or string halt, and after you bought him you would place the blame on the seller, and of course the seller is to blame for not mentioning those things, but in order to save yourselves much worry and money you should use your judg - ment and foresight in these matters before the transfer is made. As I said the practical horse buyer has a system of looking over a horse, and his system is seldom if ever explained to the public. If you will give me a few minutes I will give you an idea and my way of looking at a horse that I am about to buy, and if you will follow me closely and do as I do there is no need of getting deceived in the purchase of a horse. After asking that the harness be removed, I first step in front of the horse, look in his mouth and get the condition of the teeth so as to determine his age, and pretty nearly every intelligent farmer ought to be able to tell that; I next look at the eyes and find out regarding his sight and this should be done when he is facing out of a barn, not in sunlight, but in good barn light to see if his eyes are sound. Then step in front of the horse and examine the front limbs and look for splints below the knee; then look and feel for sidebones; then take a side view of him and see that he has no curbs on his hing legs and glance over the hock for any kind of spavin; then step behind the horse and see that the hips are alike; in fact look for blemishes of any kind or nature then look at the under and top line. Roll his main over and look for pollevil or swelling of any kind on" his head or neck, as often times those things are hidden from view, and see that he has no fistulo or similar defects. Then ask him to walk him off, then to take a trot, and last but not least, run him at the top of his speed about three blocks to test his wind, placing your ear close to his nos - trils when he first stops; then see that he has no crampiness, shiver - ing or string halt. I am merely offering these suggestions and hints to you so that when you come to purchase a horse you will know how to go about it, for you must remember that the man who is selling you the horse will invariably try to get all the horse is worth and make a nice profit. If you will follow this general outline that I have given you of looking at a horse when you go to buy you will not be very badly deceived. I believe the average man represents a horse as he is, but you know some fall short of it. t There are many other things to be considered when you buy a horse, but I will not speak at length on any one of these points, for example the color of a horse. That alone is an important ; in the draft horse as it has often much to do with getting a ' price or satisfying the buyer. Many of our highest buyers, and Armour, and Cudahy for example, work grays as a rule. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">128 ANNUAL REPORT I they pay very high prices for just the kind that suits them. Our reries work grays and roans, and some of them dark sorrels. The rers are generally high buyers, but what they desire is an advertis- Eolor. Then we have the National Biscuit Company that uses grays □me cities, as in Philadelphia they use grays altogether. So you the color of the horse is an important item and of great value in y cases. I For illustration take this photograph of Pabst's Blue Ribbon Six ■e Teem. I refer you to the front horse, he is what I call a per - color gray. He is a shade dark, but that shade is just right, for a he gets older it will turn light and he will be just right. Most ■em are a shade dark now, but they will soon be of uniform shade, wheel horses are perfect now. These horses bring fancy prices cost the breeder very little more to raise. When we horse buyers are buying a horse to sell in open tale rings we have to consider, and make a guess as to how he will appear in the ring, as some horses "get away from the whip," as we term it, better than others, and some have a lofty way of moving about to make them sell well. Some are sour and head-strong, and make a poor appearance in th e sale ring. A horse's best age for the market is from five to eight years. Some might be fed at a profit a little younger some a little older. We will now consider preparing th e horse for market. Before putting your horses on feed after you raise or buy them, especially If you intend feeding them for some time, there are a few things which ihould be done. The first thing is to float off the rough edges of his grinders, as they are often in bad shape for him to properly grind his food, and this is important in a feeding; horse. If he has any colt teeth they should be pulled, as a horse with a full mouth is of more value on the market. As to his feet, the ragged edges should be trimmed off and they should be neat and presentable. Good feet is a very important feature in this matter, as most of our horses go east to do hard work on paved streets, and the eastern buyers demand the best of feet. The western buyer is not so strict about the feet as they generally expect to use them on the dirt, nevertheless all buyers demand good feet. In fact I think any farmer or private horse owner should have sufficient pride in his horses to keep his horses' feet well trimmed, for he cannot tell what day he might want to aell them, but regardless of that it is much better for the horse. Remember that all these little things are necessary to make a first class horse. t There is another thing of great importance. Whether you are ng horses to feed, or buying them to feed, be sure to get them ed, big boned, good middle and low down. I would rather a horse d look a little coarse when I go to to feed him than to look too and delicate. When he gets the fat he will have the quality, for ity is fat. These are the best definitions I know of. Now, when you get in possession of one of these truly good types of the draft horse, my advice would be lo get him in fine shape before </seg>
            <seg id="p130">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 129 5 offering him for sale. Do not lead him in to show a buyer when in a ragged, rough and poor condition and then wonder what is the mat - ter with the horse-buyer. Too many of the poor ragged kind that are classed too thin in flesh when led in to sell really have no Job on earth. Mr. horse buyer does not want to hurt your feelings, so, thinking the best way to get rid of you without hurting your feelings will say, your horse is just a little thin for the market, and I might buy him next time I come. He goes away, and you go hom e feeling good toward the buyer, and thinking he is a good fellow; but if he had told you the truth, that you did not have the right kind of a horse for the mar - ket, or that your horse was no good on earth, you would tell your friends the horse-buyer was a fool and did not know a thing about • horse. And in that way the farmers and young men get the wrong idea about their horses. I am here to instruct you and tell you u near as possible the right type to raise. So after a while the same horse-buyer comes around again and you bring your horse to him and he looked him over as before, and he says, your horse has not done \ery well, has he? I think the market will be better a little later on. He still makes you feel good, but he does not buy your horse. Now, gentlemen, these are facts, and the truth is that your horse has no Job on earth; he did not have the right kind of a sire, or the right kind of a dam. Horsemen as a rule are born and not made like men of many other professions. The Lord has gifted us with certain talents, and peculiar faculties, as some are born preachers, some lawyers and some horsemen, and if we do not have a little taint or sprinkling of the genius of the horseman in us we had better study up and read as muck as possible about horses and their characteristics. II am a great advocate of raising horses that the market demands, my experience with the eastern buyers, or any others for that mat - ■ they invariably like a horse that is well fed and is fat. I often les talk with a farmer and he will say, I have some horses at home d I try to keep them a little thin. I tell him that I like them fat i up-to-date. He will then ask me if I buy them and feed them kill, I say, "no, I am not doing that, but I am trying to furnish and &gt;p something the trade demands." I like to keep what the other low wants, and as they Invariably want them fat, I in like manner nt to keep fat ones. This is just a suggestion but ft will prove a uable one to you if you conform to it. I Just another suggestion as to the feed. I have not found the ding of horses any great secret. It is just a little different from ding cattle. The horse is not as easily thrown off its feed as the r. I have often fed cattle, and if I made a slight mistake, or change y would all become upset in a short time, but it is not so with the se. Horses grind their feed better than any other livestock, there - e they need a different kind of roughness than cattle, a little more what may be termed a balanced ration. Their grinders are very rerful and consequently grind their food very fine and get more </seg>
            <seg id="p131">130 ANNUAL REPORT Kof it than other livestock, and if they do not thoroughly masti - and grind their food there is something wrong, and as hereto - stated you should investigate it. A good cattle feeder, or a good feeder would make a good horse feeder. Another word regarding feeding which I claim is the most pro - fitable of any livestock feeding if properly watched. I would advise, If you are feeding a short feed and only a limited number, keep thm up pretty close, that is, in box stalls or tied, and hav e a good little lot to turn them in Just a few minutes in the warm part of the day. They need exercise, and they do better if they can get it every day. If you feed the horses a long feed, say 60 or 90 or 100 days, or even six months, and feed them large quantities I would advise putting them In warm open sheds, keeping them a little warmer than you would cattle. If you are going to feed a large number, good warm open sheds with just an average sized barn lot is my idea, not putting over 49 in the lot, but twenty would be better. They should be closely watched when they are first put in, and if there are any bad ones that keep constantly biting and kicking they should be separated from them. The lot instead of being square should be round or six sided. When you first put up the horses, whether shipped in, roaded in, or if they come from your own pasture, see that they first have a good fill of hay before you put them on grain, as hay will not hurt an empty horse. Many people imagine they need something heavy at first to sustain life, but that is injurious to the animal. Another thing do not water them the first thing, but let them have their fill of bay. That will work in a similar manner to the turning of cattle into the stalk field empty, especially when you first turn them out in the fall, turn them in full, as it will be less injurious. After I have done as above stated, I then feed oats, corn and bran in equal parts. When I first put them on feed I make it a little stronger of the oats and bran, then gradually mix it stronger with corn. The feed-man should have a watchful eye on the horses he is feeding all the time, and he can tell a balanced ration when he reaches it. As to hay and roughness I generally feed alfalfa and some other good hay or rough- Bass with the alfalfa, as I think a change, or different kinds of rough - ness, balances a horse's feed much better. They should have free access to good water, plenty of salt, but not too much at a time. tWith reference to the water I would recommend at this season e year that the water be warmed, as cold water chills the horse, :es the temperature of the stomach and disturbs digestion. Re - ber that too much corn and too much alfalfa is strong on the ;ye, and you will find they cannot stand it, and may even go down JU. tBy this way of feeding a horse should put on from two to four ds a day. I generally weigh my horses when on feed and keep ord of it from day to day, and if they do not gain three pounds y I think they are not doing well. It is not necessary to curry </seg>
            <seg id="p132">131 much when feeding, for when a horse gets fat he becomes good-haired and sleek. Horses in some respects are very much like oysters — they hav« their season; so when you begin to feed horses for the market you should have a knowledge of the kind the various seasons of the year demand. However, I would say that extra good draft horses are gen - erally in demand the year round. Jersey chunks and grocery-wagon horses sell best in the spring, and southern horses, those intended for the cotton fields, sell best in the fall and early winter. I live down in the south-eastern part of the state, which is on« at the banner counties of the state. I have lived there 46 years, ao it must be a good county, and you can see by my appearance that I have been treated well, and I have prospered as well; and I regret to say that to my knowledge there is not one draft horse weighing over 1500 pounds of a good marketable type for sale in the county. It looks very much like we would have a horse famine. Do not under - stand that that applies to a general shortage of horses, but we hav« a shortage of what the market demands. The farmer will tell you he does not want "them big bulls," but if you can raise that kind and get $350 for them I say raise them, and you are shortsighted if you don't. If the market demands these small inferior horses then I say raise them, but you know the market is glutted with them, and there is absolutely no argument in favor of raising them. I used to be a fiend for harness horses, and in the early days before they used heavy draft horses the demand for them was good, but they have been replaced by the true type of draft horse. In those early days I would ship a carload of harness horses to the State Fair at Lincoln and I would get fancy prices for them. I also had a pair of harness horses of which the photograph I now show you is a cor - rect likeness, and which I considered the best pair of horses of its kind in the middle west, and I carried off a good many first and second tion for the harness horse, I believe in being an up-to-date man. and in a short time I sold another for $975. Three years ago when I had this pair of horses here, a man stepped up and said, "Mr. Howard, what will you take for them." I had several chances to sell it at a fair profit, but I knew it would bring more money and shortly there - after a man came to my place and bought them and shipped them te St. Louis. So you can see that while I have always had great admira - tion for the harness horse, yet I believe in being an up-to-date man, and not a back number. As the Scotchman says, "have something around you that will give the grapes." Have something around you that will give you the bread and butter. Know show you a picture of a bunch of horses that I sold at one sales that averaged $270 around. They were not fine, but just They were shipped to Boston and sold for $380. Here is a pair ppled gray horses on which I put 965 pounds in four months. ■rally hold my sales along in March. Last year my sale was held </seg>
            <seg id="p133">132 I lie 25th of March, at which time I sold 314 head, and the first ten aged $358.50 around, the first one of which was a dappled gray sold for $430. When I put him in the pen he cost me $300, and feed bill was about $50.00, making me a nice profit of $80.00. id a little high for it, but he afterwards went to St. Louis and ight $500 and from there went to Boston where he brought the lsome sum of $900, and I expect he is still making money. I have often been asked as to the beet age at which to buy. From five to eight years is the best for the market. I bought a four year old last year for $140. I fed him about five months and at my sale he brought $375, a gain of $235. If any of you cattle advocates can beat that please make it known. It cost me about $50 for feed, and af - ter deducting some minor expenses he was a net profit to me of about $175. I know we all like fat cattle and fat hogs, but we never think of shipping a bunch of hogs until they are ready for the market, and of course you expect a living profit on your cattle and hogs, but I am bere to tell you that with proper management and good judgment you can make more money off of draft horses than any other livestock on your place. I am not here to give my business away, but I am here to help build up our market and state and make it a better place for fine horses. And if you are at all interested in this matter and will take hold of it you can make a handsome profit. tThls country in which we live is the greatest and richest agri - xal country in the w jrld, and it is neglected in this line. If any &gt;u have not trk-d this branch of stock raising and you want to ire a little I will be glad to assist you and help you get a start if will call upon me, and I will help you buy such marcs or stal - that will make you money, for, as I said, there is a great shortage ;al good craft horses. Many of you will say you want a 1000 or 1200 pound horse, or team that you can use for road purposes in going to town and for general use. I will admit of course, that the farmer should have that kind of a Iior&gt;e for light work, but you should keep there heavy horses for your heavy work and heavy plowing, and then when they have reached the age of seven or eight years you can sell them to good ad - vantage, and you will find that your profit will be much greater than en your medium tnd light weight horses. I occasionally meet a far - mer in town and 1 ask him if he has any draft horses at his home and he will say, "yes." I then ask him what they will weigh, and he will say, "oh, 1150 pounds, or such a matter." That is his idea of a draft horse, but when he comes to offer them for sale the horse buyer does not care for them. You cannot sell a man a fork when he wants a hoe, and vice versa. Be up-to-date and raise draft horses. That is the best advice I can give you, or that anybody else can give you. They will make you richer and more contented with life, and will help pay off some of your notes at the bank, if you have any. Much good can be said of the mule, however, that is not what I </seg>
            <seg id="p134">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 133 I speak about, but the same reasoning and argument will apply to i that applies to horses, but if you do raise any, raise good ones — ig wagon and sugar mule, and have them 15-2 or 15-3. Always something for which there is a demand, and of which if possible is a shortage, and when you come to sell it you will have no diffi - in disposing of it. I had very little trouble disposing of my draft horses at my sale the 25th of last March. But the principal thing 1 did was to spoil the farmers in our community. 1 bought of Mr. Jones that $140 horse and sold him for $375, and now he is jealous of me, for they think I made that much off of every hdrse; but if I did, and with the number 1 sell every year, Nebraska wculd not hold me. However I do make a nice pro.1t on all of them, and I have a way of getting out and buying' them of people living at a distance, and when I have these sales I let my friends and neighbors in and give them an opportunity to make money at my sales. Now as to getting buyers at your place, or on your farm. If you have the horses the country demands it is an easy matter. If you live in some secluded spot, or over in the hills of Missouri where the James boys lived in 1S47, or if you live in a cave, if you will adver - tise in (he stock papers that on the 25th of next March you will place on sale 300 draft horses, you will get all the buyers you want. I have the addresses of all the leading horsemen in the country and thy will send their buyers to your sale and will bid the full market price. For instance in New York City is the firm of Fitxmorrill &amp; Carroll. They run a public auction, and they will send their Mr. McGinty out to look over your horses. Then in Boston there is Harris Brothers, they do an enormous business, and would send one of their representatives. Then in St. Louis the firm of Holland, Nugent &amp; Maxwell Commission Com - pany will send one of their men — probably Mr. Jesse Nugent. They sell more horses and mules at public auction than any other one firm rn the world. And as far west as California, Mr. George Dunn of Riverside, will come and buy horses for the orange districts. C. F. Clay of Ogden, Utah, is always on hand, and Mr. W. B. Blair of South St. Joseph and Indianapolis is always on the look-out for select stock. So if you live across the river or in a cave, if you advertise that you have 300 horses weighing from 1500 to 2200 pounds for sale they will come to you and bid as long as they can hold their breath. I have been having these sales for eight or ten years, and I hare never had the least difficulty in getting buyers. Of course, when they come I treat them well by setting a good table and furnishing plenty ei~ars and I make them believe I am a pretty fine fellow, but here is an argument in favor of the big horses: "Wanted; horses, mares and mules for southern and eastern markets for which I will pay the high - est market price in cash." That is the notice I send out, and you will notice I pay cash for the good ones, but for the little ones we trade most any old thing. Bring in your big horses with weight and Quality </seg>
            <seg id="p135">134 and get cash and I will ship them to Indiana where they cannot raise them as cheap as you can. This is good argument and horse sense. I But let me advise you when you have 300 small horses weighing l 900 to 1000 pounds for sale you want to advertise in all the pap - of the country that you will sell them in a very public place and will of course get a certain class of buyers who are looking for ething cheap but when you have the truly good type draft horses sale then send the bill to people whose names I just mentioned they will then come and offer you choice and fancy prices, and cash will be forthcoming on delivery of the goods. I want to ;e this as forceful as possible so you will see the importance of ing high grade stock. BWho is to blame for these little bad things? Who is to blame the man who raises a poor crop of corn? It is the man who tills soil. Now, Mr. farmer and horse raiser, get out ycur pencil and i little figuring. I do not believe you are up-to-date, and if you tot figure a nice profit on these big horses you are to blame. Some of you will say it is the local stallion dealer who is to blame — the man who stands the stallion. Remember the local stallion dealer will buy as good a stallion as the trade demands, and he will get along with as cheap a one as the mare owners are satisfied with. So if you object to the cheap one he will buy a better and heavier one. If you refuse to patronize him he will soon replace it with a better one, so if you make the proper demands you will get what you want in a fhort time. Tell him you want nothing but first class stock. Then your local stallion owner will go to his importer, and say, "I cannot get along with this small cheap stallion, my trade demands a first class stallion, one weighing from 2000 to 2200 pounds," and when the im - porter goes to Europe to buy these stallions he will not import the little inferior stock for Nebraska or Kansas, but he will buy higa grade stock such as is imported for Ohio and Pennsylvania, lie will import the best that money can buy. Do you farmers and horse raisers demand the best? If not, you should. Demand what the market demands and you will get it, and if you cannot breed to a good stallion do not breed to any at all. Re - member the best is the cheapest in the end. How many are there within the sound of my voice who have from one to a dozen little bad things around them eating up the profit that his good horses make? You cannot sell them, nobody wants them. My advice to you is to get them in as good shape as you can and sell them for the high dollar. Down in Philadelphia they have a little one-horse auc - tion they call the high dollar auction; they sell them for the high dollar. Don't let the runty poor horses eat up the profit that is made by the good ones. What is true of horses is likewise true of cattle and hogs. The best is none too good. When a buyer comes to your town to buy he picks out the good ones and leave* the poor ones in the country. I received a letter from </seg>
            <seg id="p136">135 J&gt;mmission man some little time ago and it said, buy some good down heavy draft horses regardless of cost; get possession of i. He says horses that stand 19 hands high and one and a half es wide may look all right but we cannot sell them; but get them down, wide out, big boned with good middles, which is the type market wants, and that is the type you see in this picture, and is the kind that makes a nice big net profit. I have shown you e pictures to give you an idea of what the market calls for today, if you can get anything better than these well and good, but set 1 as good if you can, and you will have no trouble disposing of I have given you my general, idea of the horse business as to breeding, feeding and general care, and I trust that I have not wearied you with this long rambling talk. I have told it in my own language and in my own way, and as this is the first public speech I ever made in my life I trust you will overlook my mistakes and short-comings. At one of my sales a Mr. C. M. Gross was auctioneer and instead of making the opening speech, called on me, and of course I made a few impromptu remarks, and just how well they took I am unable to say, but before the day was over I sold 350 horses at a nice profit. At one time I shipped a load of horses to Macomb, Illinois. They were fine horses and Mr. O'Leary was the auctioneer. It was a bad rainy day and he felt sorry for me and so expressed himself to the few who had come to the sale, and in opening the sale he turned to those present and said, "I will now introduce to you Mr. Howard from Ne - braska." I told them I was not much of an orator, such as Nebraska was proud of, but I said: "I have the groceries to present to you today. In other words, I have the horses, and regardless of what they bring; two weeks from today I will sell two more cars in this ring." We Nebras - kans are noted for one thing, when we fail once we try again; and somehow those people took a shine to my horses, and ever since that time my word is good with those people, and I sold them a great many horses, both mares and geldings, and have saved them money on them. If any of you have any questions to ask on the breeding of horses for the market I will be glad to answer them to the best of my ability. ■ Dr. Leonard: I would like to know the difference you make in feeding of the young and older horses for the market? ■ Mr. Howard: The same feed for the four year old would answer the five, six, seven, and eight year olds. • Dr. Leonard: And how about exercise and air? Mr. Howard: As I stated, you should have a good warm open Ehed and let them have ample exercise. When you first put them on feed, watch them closely for a few days, and if there are any kickers or biters they should be separated and put into box stalls, but even those should be turned out a little while each day in warm weather. They should have a stated amount of exercise. Dr. M. T. Bernard, Grand Island: How do you feed them? </seg>
            <seg id="p137">136 Mr. Howard: When a horse comes off the road, or is shippee in, or comes from the farm, he should first be fed all the hay he wants then after that he should have a mixed ration of bran, oats and corn Do not try to make them fat the first week. If I was selecting the hay I would use choice timothy hay. The blue stem is all right, bu I like it best for bedding. Mr. Wm M. Ball, Auburn: Are you in favor of alfalfa? I Mr. Howard: It is good to have a good big feed rack full o fa, and then have some other kind of good roughness, and while are eating the alfalfa they will also consume other roughness it puts them on what we term a balanced ration. A horse wil more good out of grain than any other livestock. There is no h turning a bunch of hogs behind a bunch of horses, but as you mow, there is after a bunch of cattle. The horse grinds his food i perfectly than any other animal, therefore they get more good nourishment out of the food than the cattle, and therefore the e must have more roughness, and plenty of it when you put them eed, but fill them with hay at first. Dean E. A. Burnett, Lincoln: What proportion of corn to oats would you feed after the horse went a month on feed? Mr. Howard: I would not use over two-fifths corn, and the bal ance corn and cats, and I have had very little use for the veterinarian I have a good barn, well ventilated, and I never myself called a horse doctor. But last fall when away from home I had a road stallion tha was quite a glutton, and I changed men on him. He would fill him self up and get colicky and was subject to these spells; so while was up here my wife called me up and said Jay Moore was sick and that she had called the veterinarian, and that the horse was tremb - ling, and that he had the colic and the veterinarian thought he woulc die before morning. I said, "tell the doctor to go home and you g to bed; turn Jay Moore into the mule pen and let him alone." knew what was the matter with him, and I am afraid the veterinarian did not. (Cheers.) The Doctor stayed up with the horse ail night an gave him medicine every two hours, but he did not ki'.l -him. Man j eople wonder how I get along so well without a horse doctor, am they often ask my hired man about it, and they say: "I want you to tell me on the q. t. what he feeds them." and all the man could an •wer is, that Howard gets them fat, and never gives them medicine 1 am not a dope fiend, but give my stock good food and at proper in tervals. I am a little different from the average horseman, I do no use the corn after it is worked over, I use it in its first form. If the horse's diet is carefully watched, nature will take care of him an&lt; there will be little or no sickness. ■ Mr. F. E. Delano: How much corn do you feed a horse weigh - 1600 pounds? Mr. Howard: When we feed ear corn we generally measure it by the basket, and when we feed shelled corn, it is so many quarts or so many bushels to a bunch of horses, but as I said we give them </seg>
            <seg id="p138">137 I balanced ration, feeding them light on corn at first and gradually easing it. This year oats is high and I am telling my men to cut oats off and feed heavier of bran and corn, for when hay is high don't make much mistake in feeding bran, for the bran takes the e of hay, but as I said, you should watch them when feeding e quantities of corn, for it is very heating and has a tendency Dunder the horses, and by all means keep corn out of them at first. Mr. W. M. Ball, Auburn: Don't you blanket or stable the horses? Mr. Howard: The longer I remain in the business the less do I care to blanket them. The buyer does not like to take them out from under a warm blanket and ship them. Whenever a horse gets fat he will get sleek and smooth and good-haired. Fat is quality, and qual - ity is fat. When you get fat steers they get good hair and sleek. Of rourse Just before you sell them it is advisable to clean them up, and if they are fat they will clean up in a few days. I say a few days, 1 mean by that a couple weeks they should be curried, depending upon the conditions of the horse. Another point is to buy a good horse when he is thin. That is where so many men fail. When he gets fat he will have quality and good hair. If they are high grade they gain rapidly and look much better after fattened than you would imagine. I would advise any little farmer, if he has any good geldings, or his neighbor has any good ones that he buy them and feed them for the next two or three months, get them fat and they will bring him a profit. It is a good time of the year to invest, and if y»u use good judgment you cannot lose anything. The Illinois and Iowa farmers are now finishing out their horses, but we in Nebraska are lame in that respect. Remember they will sell better, and even if you do not sell them they will look better to you and do better work for you at home. When you come to mate money lay your hobbies aside and buy the horse that the market demands, and the horse that your neighbor or the man in the city wants. If he wants an up-to-date horse, and a pure bred horse, furnish it, and lay your hobbies aside. I thank you for your attention. (Applause.) I President Ollis: These meetings and discussions are exceed in - teresting and I regret that we cannot allow you to go for another hour, and I am sorry so many of you were not here promptly at opening of the meeting to hear all of Mr. Howards talk as he red his subject in all its various phases and covered quite fully y of the questions asked by you.

            <seg id="p139">138 ANNUAL REPORT HORSE BREEDING PROBLKMS. By Prof. G. L. Carlson, Norfolk, Mr. President and Gentlemen: I have talked to you people so often, at least many of you, that what I shall have to say may be a repetition of what you have heard before. We have just listened to a valuable talk by Mr. Howard, and I regret that It could not have been heard by every farmer and farm boy in Nebraska, for it would relieve me of much responsibility. The keynote of his address was tha't you need better horses, and that you produce what the other fellow wants. I have been talking sound horses, and better horses, and better bred horses so much and for fo long a time that a great many speak of me as the Nebraska horse crank, and so Mr. Howard has made it mud easier for me to speak kl did not see one of the programs of this meeting until I ar- I here this morning, hence did not know what was expected of so I will talk off-hand upon some of the more common problems orse breeding, and I think all I shall say can be based upon the y "Are we doing as well as we might or should?" I am not really thinking of you men here when I ask this question. You who are witnin the sound of my voice are not as much in need of anything I might say as the man who is out upon the farm today and who does not attend any horse meetings, or go anywhere; and who never attends our institutes or agricultural meetings where progres - rive methods are discussed. He is the problem after all in horse breeding, and in the breeding of every other kind of live stock, and be is the one who hinders the development of this particular industry in our state. Your presence here today is proof of the fact that you are representing the best intelligence of the state, or you would not be here, so I will try to confine my remarks largely to the needs of the man who is absent, rather than your needs. I To emphasize what I may say later on, I will ask you a few itlons which will emphasize the need of more thought, and of a er training if we hope to succeed in horse breeding. I will also to cover the little every-day problems that confront us. It is the e mite that is needed to be known more than it is those things that ' a few students know. I How many farmers are there in Nebraska who know how to pro - r care for a horse, and who know how to give him reasonable in order to be successful as a breeder? Stop and think of it for &gt;ment. How many farmers are there in Nebraska who know how arness and hitch up a horse? That is one of the most common - l duties we have upon the farm. Perhaps it never occured to you what every farmer in our state knew how to do that. I believe i show you that not one in a thousand know how to do it. How r horses are there upon the farms of Nebraska today ten years </seg>
            <seg id="p140">STAiLION REGISTRATION BOARD 139 Ei of age that are not covered with scars at the shoulder and Have you ever seen very many? I have not. I know those would not have those scars there if they had been properly ed and hitched. You can readily see that. In Great Britain I have personally inspected about 312,000 horses and I cannot recall ever seeing one with a sore shoulder or neck trouble. I know that a groom over there would not be able to hold his position if he permitted any horse he was handling to con - tract a sore neck or shoulder. You can readily see that it is not necessary to have a sore neck or sore shoulder if you will give the matter proper study and attention. And because of just such little things is one of the causes why we do not have more foals, and It is one of the causes why we lose so many young foals. tHow many farmers are there in Nebraska who change the draft n they change the hitch from the harrow or disc to a wagon? Did er occur to you that it is absolutely necessary if you wish to keep shoulders and necks of your horses sound? You can readily see point. Just imagine taking a horse that is drawing on this angle refer to an oblique angle — and change him to a horizontal or level t without changing the draft. I We have the representation of a level draft when we hitch him to igon and we have the reverse when we hitch to a disc or bar- In the countries where horses are handled successfully you notice that three or four times a day they change the draft aa change from one implement to another. They change and re - lge the collar to the shoulder as the necessity demands. I can - recall ever seeing a Nebraska farmer doing that, and that is we have so many sore necks and shoulders. Another cause of sore shoulder is, after your horses have stood in the stable all winter and before you begin working them in the spring, you will find that their necks will be a little thicker and fuller than later in the summer, after they have worked for a time in the field. You will flt your collars when you first begin work in the spring, and after they have worked a little while they will begin to shrink, and many of you never watch the time they begin to shrink. You should change the collar to meet the change in the size of the neck; and generally when any of you have noticed that change you in - variably get an old pad and stick it under the collar, thinking it would remedy the trouble. Did it ever occur to you that when you pad a collar you in no way change the draft upon the shoulder of that horse? The draft has got too far out, and has reached a tender part of the shoulder, and there will be a rolling there, and it is because of the rolling movement that you get the sore shoulder. It should flt as snugly as it is possible to make it. You cannot get it too tight If the collar will go back to the shoulder, the depth of the collar has little to do with a sound shoulder, and we pay more attention to it than to the width of the collar. 99 Per cent of the collars made and </seg>
            <seg id="p141">140 ANNUAL REPORT sold upon the market are too wide for the horses that wear them. That is a common fault of our American collars; they are too wide. They should fit snugly. If ycu will place your fist against the neck and shoulder you can readily detect where the draft should come, and if the collar is half an inch too wide it will come out over the shoulder and we then have that rolling motion which is the main cause of sore shoulders. I want to ask you who have not given this thought that the first time you hitch your team, raise the collars and look at the shoulders, and you will discover it, and you will also be surprised by observation to know the few horses that have not at one time had •ore shoulders and necks, which is not necessary. And furthermore, after your attention is called to it and you do not use your influence to remedy it you will be guilty of extreme carelessness, and in ad - dition thereto you will knowingly unfit your horse for the best ser - vice he is capable of rendering. The more common problems of the horse breeder would be v type, quality, the breeding in the stallion, sterility and barrenness, care and bandling and feeling and marketing. Probably about all the prob - lems of the horse would come under those heads. I talked to you last &gt;ear on the subpect of barren mares. It is not necessary to take up that subject today, further than this, that in the sterility of stallions it may be well to remember that nature made every male a producer. If he does not produce the fault is yours generally, and not the horse's. It may not be yours wholly. It may be the fault of the man ahead of you who owned him, but it Is largely yours because you bought him, for you had no business to buy him if you did not know he was a pro - ducer. I might in this connection say that all horses are not virile iu the same degree. Same stallions inherit a great amount of virility from their ancestors, eni they inherit the tendency to virility, and their ancestry on the part of the dam or sire were so virile that it matters very little how we handle them, or what we do with them, they continue to remain breeders. But there are others that inherit a tendency to be shy as breeders and it is with those that we have trouble. If they are not fed correctly, if they are over-fed; if they are - over used in service, or if they are kept with too little exercise they are the ones that first go wrong as breeders. There are horses that have never been given any exercise in their lives, but kept in little box stalls and yet they remain good breeders all their lives, but they •re In the minority. We find that the tendency to sterility in stal - lions is an increasing one. It is increasing every year in spite of all that we are Baying against it or for it, and in spite of th e education that is being carried out to the farmer and breeder throughout the KWe do not pay attention enough in the first place to get our ling stock from virile families, well known virile breeders. The ness in our breeding system has been that we have known so about the horse w e buy, and we know probably nothing about </seg>
            <seg id="p142">141 this matter except what some man tells us. That is how most of this sterility comes about. The same rule holds good and applies to the mare. Barren - ness is actually increasing in* this country in spite of all that has been done and said for, or against it. The same forces are at work here and many of our mares, our best individual mares that have descended from shy breeders have a tendency to barrenness, and that tendency in increasing because of it. Added to that is the want of proper care, over feeding, feeding too much corn, and abuse in the use of these animals. A farm mare should work and can work and raise a good foal, but statistics show they do not breed as well when they work as when they do not. It is because of the abuse, rather than the use. It is those things that are telling, and they are operating to in - crease the barrenness among our farm mares. I Another thing, we are careless in the attention we give to the &gt; when driving her and then permitting her to stand in a draft" 1 over heated, as for example, driving her to town on a cool day, ; her out in the street and letting her remain there until thor - ily chilled, and for years thereafter you will notice an inflamed itlon of the mucous membrane throughout, and this will give you ble in the breeding barn; or they may be caused by some of the ;s heretofore mentioned, or by a cold or catarrhal condition, or result of influenza, but we will find those conditions present be - p of want cf proper care and attention. IThen another problem is that of the less of foals. So much has i said and done in the last 25 years in th e interest of the breeder, elp him in limiting the loss of the young foals, but as a matter act the loss of young foals is increasing. Right here we have ence of the real need of attention along this line. As I said at beginning, it is not you people here that need this advice so much, not you that is the cause of the low per cent of live foals, and the ; per cent of dead ones. It is the farmer who is not here. He is one hard proposition to reach. He is not a reader. He gets very i from livestock journals, or bulletins, and nothing from a meeting this. It is the man back on the farm today who gives us the most ble. I Some foals are lost because we are careless in making prepara - for their arrival in the handling of the mare before its foaling, instance, we find right out here on every hand, farmers that have . farming and raising foals for 30 to 35 years, who will tie their ?s in with other horses and let them remain there until after foal comes. It would surprise you if you would go out amongst farmers and get a full report of cases of exactly that condition, the loss of foals from that source is the result of gross carelesa - and negligence. The little foal in his first efforts to get up is apt ide around and get under another team and be stamped to death, l assuming that that does not occur, and that the mare has been </seg>
            <seg id="p143">ANNUAL REPORT 142 given a place by herself there is Quite ft loss In parturition which we »ill all say is an unnecessary loss. Any one who will go Into the stockraising business, even to the extent of one brood mare, should be considerate enough and thoughtful enough to make the necessary preparation for it, and place the mare in such a place as will insure the safe arrival of the foal and its future care. The trouble is most of our farmers are careless, or they were born tired and have no special love for hard work and they take things the easiest way. They will often try to save the mare and destroy the foal in cases of dif - •cult parturition, from which there is quite a loss, but if these sug - gestions are carried out the percentage of loss at parturition will be practically nothing if the foal is alive when it comes. Then, as soon as the little foal comes at this time of the year. •r for the next two months — and we are having foals come now, and taving constant trouble with them too. Some farmers will breed tiieir mares at any time when it is convenient to get them to the stal - lion, or more often when it is handy, because some stallion happens to come to the barn. The mare may be strong, and the foal may be •trong when it comes, but the mare has njt been exercised and the foal will have a low of vitality. Then, too, the barn has not been put in proper condition; it is dirty and filthy, and infection is the result and disease claims the foal. The place may be a cold one where there usiderable draft, and remember the foal drops from a temperature of 100 or better, and often in case the mare has fever the temperature will be 101 at the time of parturition and when it drops into a tem - ature of 40 or 50 you may know the consequences. You can Imagine how you would feel if you were to pass through the same performance. Pneumcnia is the invariable result and death follows, •nd the farmer wonders what the trouble was. They seem strong when they come, and in perhaps an hour or two they will suckle the ■tare and run about the first day, but the next day they will appear stupid, their ears will droop, and they will probably lie down and W) few get up when they once lie down unless they are assisted, and I have never known a foal with vitality enough to withstand pneumonia at that age. If you will place your ear behind the shoulder you will bear a rasping sound, and if you hear this you will know the foal is lost, or soon will be, and to further satisfy you, after the foal is dead II you will open it you will find the black blood about the lungs and even about the heart. Then we have trouble in the foal voiding its first feces. If it does not expel its first feces very quickly after It is foaled the chances are against its ever doing so without help, and if it is not given proper attention at that period death is apt to follow, and we have quite a percentage of loss from that source, which is always an early one, coming at this season of the year when the mare is shut op and inactive; but later in the season when the mare can get out </seg>
            <seg id="p144">143 lated. However, even at this season of the year there will be no low if you give it proper attention. See that tb« first feces is voided, and in expelling it 1 would much prefer warm water that has been ster - ilized by boiling, and dissolving a mild soap in it, and continue giving the injections until you are sure the first feces has passed. It is much better than medicine which often results in indigestion and much future trouble. Sometimes the foal is ruined because of dysentery. We have it in foals the same as with calves. It is not the result of infection; It is excessive feeding of the mare. The milk may be too rich, and you feed too heavy at the beginning, and this trouble is the result. There is no better way of handling this trouble than to take away the grain from the mare, and if you know the mare to be a heavy milker, draw out some of the milk, and do not be afraid of the foal suffering for want of food with a good milker. In this connection we also have trouble with working the mares out in the field and leaving the foals • I home where they should be left — never permit them to run in the field. But when the mare is working and gets warm and returns to the barn and the foal sucks the mare while she is heated we have in- Camation of the bowels; and it is not always inflamation as we under - stand it. It is a bacterial condition set up because of the heated condition of the milk and a large per cent of them die. This can be entirely prevented by milking the milk away from the mare when she comes from the field, even when you think the mare has not been over heated, milk her dry and let the foal wait at least 30 minutes before sucking. You may think it is not getting enough milk, but in two or three weeks the colt will begin to eat grain and when you begin to feed it grain, feed it clean bright oats, and it should be also allowed to get good water at any time. If you follow those sugges - tions you will have little or no trouble in that direction. With reference to the use of the right kind of a stallion, I am glad Mr. Howard brought that up, because I feel safer with him behind me than if he was not here. I believe I made the statement to you men last winter that the United States had never owned 50 draft stallions .that were sufficiently good to be a credit to the breed they represent. There are people who laugh at such a statement, but I will challenge any man in America to show me 50 draft stallions In America that has ever made their district famous for the character of its horses. That Is the only test of it. Particularly good stallions may be produced now and then, and it would be a poor district, indeed, where there could not be found one now and then. But there are 100,000 horses in Nebraska that will not sell for the cost of their feed. None of you responded to Mr. Howard when he asked if you knew of half a dozen high class horses for sale in your counties. Can you not see the point? You are all producing a class of poor scrubs that no one wants. They are a loss to you. And it does not apply to grade alone. The pure-bred scrub is much more of a scrub than the scrub that claims no breeding, because there is no deception there, </seg>
            <seg id="p145">144 We will never overcome that until we first know a stallion. That ts the problem so far as horse breeding is concerned. You will never overcome this tendency to purchase 99 undesirable horses where you purchase one that is high grade. The horse out of a job, as Mr. Howard expressed it, is the horse of Nebraska, and when you run across one that is high class, he is noticable. But this is not wholly the fault of the dealer. When you leave here to buy a stallion yflu in - tend to buy a stallion to suit your pocket book and when you have that thought in your mind you will go home with horses that will not be worth a single dollar so far as quality and soundness is con - cerned. Another thing; There are scattered all over this state a class of horses that are claimed to be good breeding that in fact are not. There is a tendency to so many poor bred horses. We flnd ■tallions that are good, and appear fair to the eye but there is nothing behind them in tbe way of breeding that makes it possible for them to sire a high class draft foal. These are the things we must attend to if we ever wish to improve the draft horse, and it does not matter how many automobiles you get, there will always be a demand for good draft horses. I say it takes a draft horse to make an automobile, because of the fact that every manufacturer of automobiles employs good draft horses, but you will never get them unless you start witn the right sires. I believe Dr. Anderson is on the program, and I believe he, today, better than any one in Nebraska can tell you a thing about this. We have one good horse in the country where we should have one hun - dred; and we have more stallions in the country than we need. It is not to increase the number of stallions, it is to decrease them if necessary; but it is to increase the quality of those we have. You cannot get something for nothing. No one ever succeeded in getting anything that way unless he was a crook, and I know you do not want to be a crook. We must have the sires first. It does not matter as to tbe breed. Mr. Howard will tell you the people do not ask him questions about the breed of the horse when he goes to sell one on the market, but they do exact of him that he gives them a good horse; they want a good draft horse, or gelding of proper size bone, con - formation, and one that is capable of doing heavy work and continu - ing to do It for a long term of years. I Then there is another point with reference to feeding the horse, necessarily for the market but for farm work and for breeding. , if 1 am permitted to use figures, suppose we take a 1200 pound e, and here is something for our veterinarians to interest thein - 's in. Very little has been said regarding the amount of fojd horse will assimilate. Take an average 1200 pound horse, some assimilate more than others. 2 Vs pounds of protein is all that average horse of that weight can assimilate. If you feed beyond you will find that you have not only wasted it but you have in - d the health of the horse, because he cannot dispose of, or void </seg>
            <seg id="p146">145 the excess of protein or albuminoids except by the way of the kid - neys, and in feeding an excess of protein we have inflambation of the kidneys; we also have azoturia, in which the liver becomes involve 1 because of the excess of albuminoids. But let us illustrate by a 1300 pound horse; if we take 12 pounds of corn which contains .98 of a pound of protein, and take 12 pounds of alfalfa that contains 1.32 pounds of protein, we have a total of 2.3 pounds Right there we have practically the amount of protein that should be given a horse, and which is all he should assimilate in a day. Now then that means il he is a good feeder and eats 40 pounds of alfalfa you have not only wasted 28 pounds, but you have injured his health. How many farm - ers back upon the farms of Nebraska today understand that as they should. There Is need of more of this work being done and more Information carried to the farmer who does not attend these meet- I will not attempt to take up any more phases of this subject, but there is one I want to speak upon. I want to take up the phase of the farm home. You will never get better horses, or better cattle, or better hogs or sheep until you have better men. The real problem of horse breeding after all is the problem of the farm and the farm »I never go away from home in any of my work that I do not i more than I leave there, and I expect to get the best of you le here. I will take more with me from you than you get out of Last week while at Topeka I was in a room covering about an acre of ground. There were two long lines of typewriter girls at their desks with just a little partition of 30 inches between them. I no sooner entered that room than I could see efficiency stamped on everything within the room. I was so interested that I mentioned it to the manager, and I asked him if he had any problems to solve in the way of getting efficient help. He says, " we havn't much else; that Is all we have." I remarked that I never had seen greater evidence of efficiency, and order and system in a room similar to that in my life. He said, "that may be true, but it took three years to solve and bring it about." He told me when they inaugurated their system and began employing the girls, they took them on a week's trial. It they proved fairly good but not quite up to the standard they would carry them for 30 days, and if at the end of that time they prove! in - competent they were let out. They made a study of those they could use and those they could not, and what was the solution of the prob - lem of the efficiency of that room? It was the mother teacher, the home In which they had been produced and reared. He said that they found without a single exception those they could not use came from homes where system and method had never been known. Thit those that proved efficient in many instances came from humble homes, but from homes where there was system, order and effi- </seg>
            <seg id="p147">146 eleney, even though there was little school training. With all our institutions of learning there will never be produced a teacher that can take the place of the mother teacher, and even she must be helped. We must have our institutions of learning as well, but the first place ii the home. The problem of horse breeding is not in the production of the horse alone, but it goes farther and deeper than that. It is the problem that must be traced back to the farm home In all walks of life. Without giving any names this manager told me of one young woman that applied for employment. They put her to work. She was the daughter of a well to do man, and she did not have to work. Her father was a lawyer, and prominent politician, and that helped her to get the position. They kept her a week and found they could not use her, but because of her social standing and position they decided to keep her thirty days. One of the young women of the establishment made an investigation of that home and the found that when she entered her home one wrap was thrown down on one chair and another was placed on another and when she came to leave it was, "Mamma, where is my hat, where is my coat." Here you see was the cause of her inefficiency. There was no train - ing in that home; she had led a life of idleness, and also one ot carelessness, and this destroyed her usefulness and her happiness (orever. So you must often go behind the stable and field to solve the horse breeding problems; you must go to the man and find out how he lives in his home, and how he conducts and manages his It is often the habit of many speakers to deal largely in pleasant - and storks, but I will not give you any of them, for I could not help you by so doing. If you get help and instruction from any source it must be by plain truthful statements of fact. This, was deeply impressed on me in Great Britain. You may talk to a British audience and deal in pleasantries and even oratory but you will fine* your audience visiting all over the room, but the moment you tell them of their shortcomings and failures, or wherein they need help they will publish the address broadcast over the empire. They get results and are in advance of us in many respects. It's the things we cannot do in which we need help. There is one thing we often hear in this country which I believe if a great weakness, ana something I hope none of you will do from this time on, and that is of berating and speaking sarcastically of the foreigner. If we remain at home we do not hear of those things, they are not brought to our notice, but the moment you go out among the people you hear it. I told you I got more out of the people than they do from me. We often hear our American farmers speak of their Bohemian neighbors as "Bohonks." The other day I heard two or three farmers in speaking of Swedish farmers as a bunch of "Oles;" and also speak of the Dutch as the "Wooden Shoe Dutch." But let me tell you what these folks are able to do. A couple months ago I at- </seg>
            <seg id="p148">147 tended a corn show at a town not far from this. The crops were poor in that country this year. I received a report of the average yield of corn, and the American farmers in that country reported 20 bushels was a good yield for them, but there was one man at that show, a Bohemian, by the way, who was carrying off all the prize*. 1 made inquiry of him, and found he spoke poor English. I was lu - troduced to his son and he said this past year they had 119 acres In corn which produced 59 bushels on the average per acre. They have i-stem on that farm, and every field is numbered, and no crop ee from any field that is not weighed and an account kept of it. &gt;und the young man was managing the place, and 1 felt prouJ n I learned that he was a product of this institution. The Amer - farmers have been making fun of the University graduate who rags to corn stalks and those things, but when they can prcJife bushels of corn to the acre when the old style farmer only gets they begin to sit up and take notice. So I say, do you see anything bat Bohemian neighbor that should cause our American farmer to r with contempt? In another district in which I worked this last year, it was a Swedish district, in fact they hadn't anything else much but Swedes in that community, and all had a fair corn crop. I found one farm of 800 acres, and inquired about it. and found they marketed MM 600 hogs, also cattle. A few years ago the son of the owner of that farm graduated from this instit.ution. Just after the boy graduated and came home, the old man bought a boar, and when the boy came home he looked at him and told the father he lost whatever he paid for him. He paid $35. The old man could not understand it, and when the boy got to arguing with him the old man even thought the boy's head was swelled, but he did not get relief, and so finally the old man went to the old lady, and he tried to get her to think the boy's head was swelled, but she gave him little consolation, and fin - ally the old lady said, "Pa, did you ever stop to think that maybe the fault is yours? That changed the old man's way of thinking a little, and finally he told the boy that he could go out and buy a boar and see what he could get, and he would pay for it. The boy went out and it took him some little time to get just what he wanted but he finally selected one and it cost the old man $102.50. The boy then began to see there was some responsibility resting upon him so he says to the father, maybe I made a mistake, and it may be that you are wrong. It would be a mighty good thing if we could find out who is right and who is wrong. Now I will give you your first choice and we will divide the 62 sows that we want to breed, and you handle 31 and I will handle 31 and we will keep them separate, and when we come to market the pigs we will see if there is any difference. So he gave the old man his first choice, and they went through the lot. When they came to sell the young crop 14 months later, the net profit of the boy's share over that of his father was $368. That was not a bad </seg>
            <seg id="p149">148 ANNUAL REPORT investment After All. It is the scientific farming and stock breeding that counts, and the old farmers are beginning to realize it from the fact that they are sending their boys to this fine center of learning. It is the boys we must depend upon. There is little hope for the old man. but there is for the boy, and I think our work should be in that direction. Another problem that has to do with the production of better horses is the problem of keeping the boy on the farm. You hear this complaint wherever you go. Now, what has really been done to keep the boy upon the farm and to make his environments pleasant and attractive? A short time ago I was before a class of boys and girls and I bad in my hand a couple of flowers and I was telling them about the life of the flower, and as I started to talk about it two old men within the sound of my voice began to visit with each other, as they did not think it made any difference to me whether they disturbed me or not. But in a little while I took up the sex relations of those flowers, a relation which does not essentially differ from that of the animal or man. I noticed they soon stopped their visiting and when I had completed my talk one of these men came up and told me he had lived upon a farm 62 years but he never knew there was any •ex business about flowers. Do you see why the boy is not staying on the farm? What has been done upon the farm to interest him in farm life and in those things that are worth living for. Gentlemen we must wake up. Did it ever occur to you that practically every banker and mer - chant in America has one hope, one desire, and that is that some day he may be able to buy a i lace in the country where he may die a peaceful death; and we see the farmers all tumbling over one another to leave the farm to go to the city to live a life of idleness, and to be in the way of others who want to do something. If I wanted to show to all the world what a complete failure I had been as a farmer I do not know of any way that I could do it so well as to leave the farm and go to the city to die. I do not know of any way that would be so effective as tTiat. Think of it! Why is this? If the farmer says he is going to the city to live because he has not the schools in the country and cannot get them, whose fault is it but his own if he has not the schools there. Did you ever think of that? The farmers of Nebraska can have anything they want if they only know how to get it. The reason they do not have it Is because they do not know how to get it. One further word. How many of you when you send a man down here to Lincoln ever know really what you are sending your lawmakers here for? Did you ever think of it?

Chairman and Gentlemen: I took the pains to make a few notes for this discussion this - afternoon. This is a very important subject, and I am sure, in order- </seg>
            <seg id="p151">150 ANNUAL REPORT to get a correct understanding of this stallion situation in the state of Nebraska it is well for us to understand at the very outset something about what has been done in other parts of the country. This move - ment for the regulation of stallions has not been local. It has been very general, and in order that you may understand fully what has been done in other states I have made a few notes which is a review of the stallion legislation In the United States. I The first legislation in the Vnited States having in view the im - ement of horses was enacted in the state of Wisconsin, April 22, 5. This law went into effect June 1st, 1906. Wisconsin there - took the initiative in enacting, a law which would regulate the ice of stallions in that state. I will read a small part of that because other Btates have copied very largely after the Wiscon - law. The first three sections are as follows: I Section 1. Every person, firm or company standing or traveling stallion for profit or gain in this state shall cause the name, ription, and pedigree of such stallion to be enrolled by the de - ment of horse breeding of the college of agriculture, university nscomin. and procure a certificate of such enrollment, from said trtment, which shall thereupon be presented to and recorded by register of deeds of the county in which said stallion is used for ic service. Section 2. In order to obtain the license certificates herein provided for, the owner of each stallion shall make oath before a notary public that such stallion is, to the best of his knowledge, free from hereditary, contagious or transmissible unsoundness or disease, or. in lieu thereof, may file a certificate of soundness signed by a duly qualified veterinarian, who shall be a regular graduate of a recognized veterinary college, and shall forward this affidavit, or veterinarian's certificate, together with the stud book certificate of registry of the pedigree of the said rtallion and other necessary papers relating to his breeding and ownership to the department of horse breeding of the college of agriculture. Section 3. The officers of the department of horse breeding of the said college of agriculture, whose duty it shall be to examine and pasE upon the merits of each pedigree submitted, shall use as their standard for action the stud books and signatures of the duly author - ized presidents and secretaries respectively of the various horse ped - igree registry associations, societies or companies recognized by the department of agriculture. Washington, D. C, and shall accept as pure-bred, and entitled to a license certificate as such, each stallion for which a pedigree registry certificate is furnished bearing the signature of the president and secretary of a government-recognized and approved stud book. IYou will note the main things in the Wisconsin law are these: In order for a stallion to be given a license it is necessary for &gt;wner of that stallion to present to the department of horse- </seg>
            <seg id="p152">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 151 Ping of the university of Wisconsin a statement from a graduated inarian with bis own oath that the horse is sound, that the horse 10 transmissible disease. And it also provides that the certl - regtstered shall be one that is approved by the United State* rnment. These are the two main things that are given in this They name in their law what these diseases are which should dis - qualify a stallion or jack from public service. The Wisconsin law is probably the most drastic of any law that has been made concerning the regulation of stallions. They disqualify a stallion for any of the following diseases: "Cataract; amaurosis (which is glass eye); periodic opthalmia (moon blindness); Laryngeal hemiplegia (roading or whistling); Pulmonary emphysemia (heaves, broken wind); Chorea (St. Vims' dance, crampiness, shivering, string-halt I ; Bone Spavin; ringbone; sidebone; navicular disease. Bog spavin; Curb, with curby forma - tion of hock. Glanders, farcy; maladie du coit; urethral gleet; mange; melanosis; and the department of horse breeding is hereby authorized to refuse its certificate of enrollment to any stallion or jack affected with any one of the diseases hereby specified and to revoke the previously issued enrollment certificate of any stallion or jack found on investigation by the department to be so affected." The Wisconsin law disqualifies a stallion for any one of these diseases. The Wisconsin law has of course been the subject of very much criticism on the part of some stallion owners because it has put out of business a large number of the stallions of that state. The Wisconsin law has been watched with much interest. Many people over the country thought that Wisconsin was starting out in a way that would be entirely too severe, and would be really a hardship to the horse industry. I think any one who has watched the effect of that law since the date it first went into effect will agree that while it has worked a hardship in some cases the final results are favo*. able to the horse-breeding industry of Wisconsin. The Wisconsin law provides for a renewal each year of the certificate issued. Iowa was first to follow Wisconsin in enacting a law relative to the registration and publication of pedigrees of stallions, which was April 10, 1906. If you will keep in mind these dates it will help you in following this. Remember the first stallion law that was enacted in the United States was in the state of Wisconsin April 22, 1905. That is the beginning of stallion legislation in the United States. It went into effect June 1, 1906. The State of Iowa was the first state to follow Wisconsin, and passed the stallion law April 10, 1906. That original law was repealed March 30, 1907, and a new law substituted, which provides, that any owner or keeper of any stallion kept for public service, exchange or transfer, who represents such stallion to be pure bred, shall cause the same to be registered In a </seg>
            <seg id="p153">152 tbook recognized by the Department of Agriculture, Washington, .. and shall forward the same to the Secretary of the Iowa State ■d of Agriculture, who shall verify the registry certificate, enroll &gt;on his books and issue a certificate giving a description, etc., of stallion and the volume and page of the stud book in which he gisterei. This Iowa law did not, as originally passed, require a inarian's certificate relative to tbe soundness of the stallion. I At the last session of the Iowa legislature (1911) the law was n amended to require an examination for soundness, which in its ieione corresponds very closely to the Wisconsin law, which dis - ifies stal'ions for public service if afflicted with the diseases pre - sly mentioned. The Iowa law as it now stands Is very similar to Wisconsin law, in that it disqualifies entirely a stallion with any of these several diseases which I read to you a moment ago. The i people evidently found. Just as we found here, that the exami - on cf the certificates of registry was not sufficient, that it was ssary to examine for soundness as well. I The Minnesota legislature enacted a law similar to that of Wls - in which was duly signed by the Governor, April 25, 1907. lesota was therefore the third state In the Union. The Minnesota further provides stallions shall be examined every four years un - sn years of age, and after the first examination shall be exempt ; examination at ten years of age or over. After they reach that they are no longer examined. Therefore the Minnesota law cor - onds very closely to the Wisconsin law, just about as drastic and t as severe. The Pennsylvania stallion law became effective January 1st, l»08. I am trying to read these to you in the order in which they were passed. This law, like those previously mentioned, permits the owner to file a personal affidavit or a certificate signed by a graduate veterinarian as to the soundness of his stallion. The Penn - sylvania Board is authorized to make needful regulations and to pro - vide for official examinations upon volunteer request from owners of stallions, and to issue certificates of approval for stallions that are approved in respect to purity of breeding, soundness, conformation, breed, type, and their suitability to improve the horse stock of the state. The Pennsylvania law further provides that stallions afflicted with hereditary, contagious, or transmissible unsoundness, or dis - eases, may be refused licenses by the Board, and when a license Is so refused, the stallion shall not be used for public service, for profit or gain in tbe state, provided, however, that the license may be re - fused under this section only when it Is certified to the Board by the state veterinarian that the stallion in question is afflicted with here - ditary, contagious, or transmissible unsoundness, or diseases of such nature, or that the abnormal condition is accompanied by such a defect of conformation as to render it probable that the progeny of the said stallion will be especially liable to such unsoundness or dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p154">153 eases. They do not want the horse to have conformation that will make the progeny liable to be unsound. Blemishes and deformities due to accidents shall not be regarded as unsoundnesses within the meaning of the act. That is entirely proper. If a horse is deformed or blemished by accident there is practically no likelihood of his transmitting that to the offspring, so it would be entirely unreason - able to shut a stallion out for any blemishes due to accident. It must be some natural deformity which is likely to be transmitted. tThe Utah law went into effect May 13, 1907. This law creates ite Board of Horse Commissioners. Other features are very ar to the Wisconsin law. The first stallion law passed in Ne - ;a was what is known as the West bill which became effective , 1909. This law provided only for the examination of pedigree*, new law which provides for the examination for soundness be - effective July 7, 1911. ■ I think possibly most of you are familiar with the provisions of first law passed in this state. It was thought at that time to be a good starter in the way of stallion legislation in Nebraska, and it probably was, but it did not meet every condition as it should. The law as it was passed at that time, as most of you know, put the entire matter in the hands of the Professor of Animal Husbandry of the University of Nebraska, and it was simply this, that all certificates of registry had to be sent here and examined, and if it was found that the certificates were issued by a society recognized by the Department of Agriculture at Washington we issued what is called a state license. There was no examination for soundness of any kind. It was to pro - tect the public of this state from breeding to what is advertised often as a pure-bred stallion, when as a matter of fact it is nothing but a grade stallion. I remember we received a large number of certificates that were issued by what we called bogus companies, companies which sent out pretentious certificates, and any horse buyer who was not familiar with the names of the recognized societies could easily be - lieve that the horse was a pure bred stallion, when as a matter of fact it was simply a grade stallion. There are several companies in the United States carrying on an illegitimate business registering grade stallions, and it goes out to the public as a pure bred because it is given on highly colored certificates issued by this bogus com- IThen, too, there are a number cf stallion owner? 'n the state have stallions of mixed breed, that are likely to lead the public slieve they are registered stallions, and the law was passed to i check on that. The public ought to be informed to a certainty whether or not a stallion is a registered or grade stallion. tThis law in some ways corresponds to the pure food law. You now what the pure food law is, and you all know that when yon an article of food It must have the name on the package, and are entitled to know whether it is adulterated or pure. The same </seg>
            <seg id="p155">154 thing is true as to the stallions. It puts the Government stamp upon breeding, ao that a party know whether or not he is breeding his mares to a pure bred stallion or merely a grade or mongrel stallion. At the last session of our Nebraska legislature a new law was ptsrii which provides for an examination for soundness. I think many of you have received copies of this law, if you have not you can procure copies by writing the Stallion Registration Board in care of the State House, and they will send you a copy of the Nebraska stal - lion law. I do not believe we have any extra copies here, but they ran be had as stated, and you get there the provisions of the new lav. I will not take the time to read it to you, but I will say that It deviates from the old law, first, by putting this in the hands of the Stallion Registration Board. It grew entirely too cumbersome to handle here; and at my own request I asked the Legislative Com - mittee to provide for a stallion registry board; so that it could be handled at the State House rather than here. Furthermore, it is hardly a part of our educational work. This Stallion Registration Board consists of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture; the Deputy State Veterinarian; and the Professor of Animal Hus - bandry, University of Nebraska. It provides for the' examination of pedigrees, but It differs from the old law in this state, in that certi - ficates are issued for grade stallions as well as pure bred stallions. We also have a provision in the new law to the effect that we have a veterinarian's examination of every stallion owned in the state. whether grade or pure bred; and that I think is a very valuable fea - ture of our Nebraska law as compared with the laws of the other states: and I believe Nebraska is the only state having that feature. I The other state laws make it possible for a stallion owner to ■e by his own oath, or by a certificate of some veterinarian that ames. a certificate of soundness from the board. In those states u own a stallion all you need do is to get a statement from your veterinarian that your horse is sound and that goes in to tnc i, and that is what they act upon. Our Nebraska law makes this provision, that these veterinar - ians who examine stallions must be appointed by the Board, and they must be thoroughly competent in every respect; and they must be Impartial. An illustration of the law of the other states is this: If a man chooses his local veterinarian to examine a stallion that local veterinarian is almost certain to favor that stallion owner if he get3 any business. That is perfectly natural and human. If you have a stallion and you employ this local veterinarian and you pay him con - siderable sums of money for looking after your horses, and you go to him and say: "Here is a stallion I want examined so I can send the certificate to the State Board, now you make it as easy as you can, I give you all of my business." It is up to you to treat him right. What else could you do? The average veterinarian will be as l'heral as he can, and perhaps he will not see certain blemishes. He will </seg>
            <seg id="p156">155 thoughtlessly overlook them. At any rate be will be as easy as he can. That has been the experience in the other states, and the law in those states has been to some degree a farce in that it makes it too easy, and is a loop-hole (or fraud and deception. So I think cur Nebraska law is a decided advantage over the other states in that re- Our inspectors are men who either give all of their time or a large part of their time to the inspection of stallions, and there is no favoritism phown in any way because they do not live in the com - cunity in which the stallion is owned. Another thing that was incorporated in the new law, and which I believe is an improvement on the Wisconsin and Minnesota laws is this. Our law is not so much of a hardship on the stallions already in the state. As the bill was originally drawn it was largely copied after the Wisconsin law, and that -disqualified stallion- for all of those unsoundnesses that I mentioned in the Wisconsin law. This seemed a hardship to all of us. We got together and talked over the situation, and we thought it would be a hardahip to the stallions now in the state to put into effect a law so drastic as that. We felt it would reduce too much the number of stallions now in the state, and would be too severe on the owners. Our new law as drawn up and passed by the legislature met with almost universal favor in the legislature, as there were only nine dissenting votes in the House and but one or two in the Senate. This law provides that the veter - inarian shall certify by affidavit that to the best of his knowledge and belief such stallion or jack is free from such hereditary, infectious contagious or transmissible diseases as: urethral gleet, melanosis, periodic opthalmia (which is moon blindness) laryngeal hemiplegla (which is roaring or whistling) or serious defect in general confor - mation. Those are the serious diseases that stallion owners, as the for in this state, and are not a hardship on the stallion owners, as the percentage of stallions affected by it is small. Our records show that out of 4,434 stallions that have been registered in this state but 55 stallions have been disqualified. That is not a hardship; in fact you will all agree with me that any stallion having any of those diseases should under . no circumstances be used for breeding pur - poses; and a stallion must be in a precarious condition to come under the provisions of our law. I When they put into effect the Iowa and Wisconsin law I presume put out of business a large number of stallions probably half of i, as the list of diseases provided for in their law, which I read to is very large. It would probably put out of business in this state l a third to half of the stallions now in service, and we thought e put it into effect in this state it would reduce the number in state too much, and we did not feel like doing that even though other states passed such a law. But the provision which we did enact into our law, and which </seg>
            <seg id="p157">156 ill believe to be a very good measure is, that all horses which come the state after the law goes into effect are disqualified by any of diseases mentioned in the Wisconsin law. That is to say, stal - ; which come into this state after this law became effective are jalified if they are afflicted with ringbone, sidebone, curb, or curby formation of hock, and all these diseases which I before tioned, but as I said that in no way effects the stallions in the i before the law became operative. It will keep out the unsound ion in the future. It refers to imported horses as well as those h have been recently foaled. I The first stallion law passed by the state of North Dakota went effect January 1, 1910. That law ha; the following provision: "The f aim of the law. like those in most of the other states. Is to bar stallions afflicted with any unsoundness or infectious diseases (i standee for public service, and to provide a means by which public may be able to know for a certainty whether the stallions pure breds or grades." In the North Dakota law the presence of any one or more of the following diseases shall disqualify a stallion from public service. These diseases are hereby defined as infectious, contagious, and trans - missible diseases or unsoundneeses for this act. I will read you the diseases which disqualify a stallion in North Dakota. You will see we are very much easier on them in this state. They disqualify them when afflicted with: "Cataract, amauroeis, laryngeal hemiplegia (roaring or whistling), chorea (St. Vitus dance, Crampiness, String - halt) glanders or farcy, maladie do coit, urethral gleet, mange, bone •pavin. sidebone' and curb when accompanied by curby hock." For any of those diseases in North Dakota a stallion is disqualified and cannot be given a certificate. Secretary Richards of the North Dakota Board reviews the sit - uation in that state with respect to the necessity of stallion regula - tion, and as this applies equally well to other states of the Union, I quote, as follows: "Any one who is familiar with the indiscriminate way in which farmers breed to stallions, knows that to have these things regulated by law, serves as a great protection to many, which without doubt will result In raising the standard of the horses our farmers raise and increase materially the wealth produced from horse raising In the state. There is no reason why the public should not be protected against dangers of this nature if they are incapable of protecting themselves. To say that some of the farmers of North Dakota are not capable of detecting whether or not a stallion they may select to use on their mares, is affected with some hereditary unsoundness or Infec - tious disease, or that they are not capable of judging of a stallion's breeding, is not speaking disparagingly of their intelligence. Few fanners can be expected to be able to recognize all the unsoundnesaes and infectious diseases, or obtain accurate information concerning </seg>
            <seg id="p158">157 i&gt;reeding of r. stallion unless they have had considerable experience le horse business, and have made a special study of it. There is eason why it Is not proper for the state to prohibit by law any from using on his mares a stallion with a hereditary unsound - or infectious disease even though he willfully desires to do it. iding the grade of the horses raised in the state can be bettered ils way." It does look pretty drastic to make a law which will prevent a man from breeding his own mares to any sort of a stallion he chooses to select, but you will see the import of this by this quotation. Most of you know, I think, that in the legislatures of this country we are copying after the laws of France and other European countries, notably France and Belgium. I will not go into detail but I will car that France has pained its great prominence as a horse breeding country because of government control of horse breeding, and they hare taken a very advanced stand. Nebraska has gone farther than any state in this I'nion, because we not only proviie for unsoundness and all those things, but we classify the stallions and we put a stamp on them. We have three forms, one for pure breds, one for cross - breds and one for gra'es. The public has the full benefit then of the inspection by these experts. I do not care to go into this much far - ther, but I will quote a little further from the North Dakota law: "Lack of conformation is generally accompanied with an un - soundness. Regardless, however, of this fact a horse that has an unsoundness, is discounted in value greatly; consequently it is very desirable to reduce the possibility of raising unsound horses to the minimum. The only v.ay that this can be hoped for is to use nothing but sound stallions and mares for breeding purposes. 'Like produces like' has become axiomatic. For this reason no argument is necessary to impress upon the horse raiser that a large per cent of the colts from an unsound sire will inherit the unsoundness or a predisposi - tion to the unsoundness." tThe South Dakota law is very similar to that of North Dakota, lar laws have also been passed in Illinois, Colorado, Idaho. Kan- Oregon and Washington. A number of other states have pi— nil ion laws last winter, among them New York. The movement sfore has become very wide-spread and in all probability every i in the union will have such a law within the next two years, if the statutes of any state do not provide for the regulation of ions that state immediately becomes a dumping ground for un - d stallions from neighboring states. JThat is exactly where we would have been this year if our pre - law had not been passed in Nebraska. If that provision for the ilnation of stallions for soundness had not been passed at the session of the legislature we would have been getting in here to - unsound stallions from Iowa, North and South Dakota, Kansas other surrounding states. </seg>
            <seg id="p159">158 In this connection I wish to say that the Kansas law provides for the examination for unsoundness, but it does not disqualify a stallion. There they merely put on the certificate of the stallion the name of the disease, so when you breed to a stallion in Kansas you walk up and look at the certificate, and on it you will see whether he has ringbcne or sidebone or bog spavin, but it does not disqualify the stallion. I heard the other day about a certain horse that was imported into Nebraska recently since this law went in to effect. As soon as the horse came in to our state he was examined, and the inspections show that he had a disease which would disqualify him under the provisions of our law. It was suggested that the horse be sent to Kansas. That was done and the horse is now in service in Kansas. That shows the value of our law. The Kansas law does not disqualify him, but it merely puts on the certificate the name of the disease and a party may breed to that stallion if he wants to. That horse was unsound and could not be stood in this state, and properly so; and the Kansas people will sooner or later discover their weakness. That is probably one of a great many similar instances. Therefore, I say we are fortunate in having that provision in our law, for our farmers are protected and are now reaping the benefit of St. In fact, this movement has become so general and of such im - portance that it would not be surprising if the United States Govern - ment would undertake the passage of a law relative to the importa - tion of unsound stallions from foreign countries. If the enactment of these laws by the various states, or the national government will bring about that improvement which is so much desired, it will surely be a step in the right direction. It would seem that whatever has been true in other countries relative to the improvement of korses by legislation, would also be true in this country. Notwithstanding the increased use of the automobile, there is certain to be a great demand for good horses in this country, and tlie industry is a very promising one for Nebraska in particular. No other state excels us in natural advantages. The grassy plains in the western part of the state and the increased acreage of alfalfa so rich in the nutrients that make bone and muscle, are especially favorable for the breeding of horses, and it would seem that it is to our interest to do all that is possible by legislation, education, and co-6peration, to make this a state having an enviable reputation for the production of the best that there is in equine flesh. (Applause.) Chairman Howard: We all enjoyed Prof. Smith's talk, for It was full of valuable information, but we will now hear from Dr. Bos - trom who will talk to us on another branch of this subject, namely "Necessity for Registration." I only wish there were more of our horse breeders and farmers here today. I now introduce to you Dr. A. Bostrom, our State Veterinarian. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">159 NECESSITY FOR REGISTRATION'. Dr. A. Bostrom, State Veterinarian. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: I After having listened to such a splendid discourse on the National jrtance of Stallion Registration it appears to me that the necessity stallion inspection would be self-evident at least from this stand- tl desire to call your attention to another well known fact, that ons are sometimes affected with contagious, infectious and here - y diseases, which can be transmitted both directly and indirectly, It is my opinion that this is one of the reasons why many of the s in the United States of America, and the several countries of pe have enacted into laws such regulations which will have a •ncy to prohibit the breeding of diseased animals. I Some of you can well remember the outbreak of Dourine in ions and mares In the Northwestern part of this state in 1895 902, which necessitated the quarantining of several counties of state, and also a great portion of South Dakota. In this out- Ic hundreds of horses and mares were killed on account of being ted with this disease; and it took seven years to completely p it out. It is claimed that all of this was caused by one stallion h was brought into this state from one of the eastern states. Another outbreak of the same kind was discovered in one of our neighboring states last summer, and upon investigation it was found that one or more stallions had been imported from Europe and used for public service in this community. Before the disease was dis - covered several stallions and a great number of mares had already been infected. Many of these have been killed, and some are still under quarantine. Out of this bunch one stallion was brought into the state of Nebraska, and after changing owners several times, was finally located and killed. As far as I know this State Is today free from this disease. tA general stallion inspection every year, I believe, will prevent infectious diseases, and the most effective method of preventing omissible diseases of live stock would be to begin before the ani - is born, and this can be done only by prohibiting the breeding of sed animals. The object of the stallion registration law is to prevent infec - tious and hereditary diseases, and to encourage the breeding of better horses. tThe natural law of heredity in both the animal and the vege - kingdom is so apparent everywhere and at all times, that it is well known that like produces like. That the owner of a stallion believer in hereditary transmission, he demonstrates every time showing and pointing out the good and strong points about his on. If the good and strong points are transmitted to the off - g, it is equally true that bad and weak qualities of the parents </seg>
            <seg id="p161">160 Kalso be transmitted to their progeny, and for these reasons I be - stallion inspection is necessary. I thank you. (Applause.) Prof. H. R. Smith: I referred in my talk to the fictitious cer - tificates that are often issued, and I now have in my hands specimens of them. This one I now show you is a certificate issued by the Amer - ican Percheron Association. They give the name as nearly like that of a recognized association as possible. That association accents a stal - lion out of a grade mare. Another one even more pretentious is one coming from LaOrscge. Illinois. Then here is an official certificate of registry issued by the American Horse Registry Association of Des Moines, Iowa. As you observe, it is a very deceptive certificate. There is an abundance of gold on it. In fact it takes lots of gold to cover up the imperfections of certain classes of horse breeding. t't is not at all surprising that a man, unless he is thoroughly ned on pedigrees, will accept that sort of certificate; for the cate shows the breeding pedigree, and it has a stunning picture p man at the head of it, and everything about it looks attrac - and intended to deceive. That association accepts stallions out ide mares. Here is one of the American Jack Registry. I The associations which are registered we have pedigrees of, and will find them in the pamphlet containing the laws regulating public service of stallions which you can have for the asking. American Saddle Horse Breeders' Association, and the Perch- Society of America, and the American Sire Horse Association, the American Breeders' Association of JacRs and Jennets are all Here is a photograph of a certificate which is not recognized. Here is another. The recognized associations are all published In this little booklet, and I would suggest that before closing the program you provide yourselves with one of them. You will then have a perfect check upon your future operations. That has been made legal by publishing the laws of the state, and the laws as published in this pamphlet have been made legal by -official act of our legislature. t Chairman Howard: The last number on this section, but not the in importance is the "Benefits of Registration," and I know of no who is better qualified to Inform you than Dr. J. S. Anderson, of ird, to whom was assigned this topic, and we will now hear from BEXKFITS OF REGISTRATION. By l!r. J. 8. Anderson, tff-ward. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: kit was without my consent or knowledge that this number on the -am was allotted to me, but I am willing to discuss it, because if I been asked to select my own subject I would have taken this </seg>
            <seg id="p162">161 6 very one, as I cannot think of another that is as easy for me to say something about as the Benefits of Registration. You doubtless would get much more good out of this subject if I had prepared a paper, or had previously arranged the details of it, but owing to the fact that I have been indisposed, and confined to my home since Christmas, I trust you will overlook many things, as my remarks will naturally be scattered. However I will do as well as I can. I Many of you who own stallions and are interested in this subject, perhaps would like to criticise or ask questions, and I would be ised to have you do so as this meeting is for our mutual benefit, matter has been pretty thoroughly gone over both this morning afternoon by more able speakers than myself. Mr. Howard gave an outline of the benefits of proper breeding and proper feeding, gave many valuable suggestions that no one will dispute. He and other speakers spoke of the benefits of registration, and what you e in the past and will continue in the future to lose by a failure to e pure bred and better stock. He presented the practical side and ; when you go to the market the horse-buyer will tell you whether did right or wrong. The idea that some parties can stand up and tell us what is right and wrong as to this registration without advancing any reasons for it is not worth discussing. We hear many criticisms along that line, and you see them in the newspapers quite frequently. And while in a ■ease I felt guilty, due to the fact that 1 was pursued first, and last, and a little all the time, I felt like resenting some of those things. But to sum it all up you know what it means. Your minds are pretty well made up and I could not change them, nor could others. It means that the man who is doing the complaining, and who will continue in the future to make the complaints, is the man who is being hurt in some way or other. He has an animal that is not right, and he would like to get it through, and he would like to have some one help him do it. tl think Mr. Carlson in his address this morning told you something is worth remembering. In order to get a good animal, in order to a good animal, you must begin by first having good men, men who a system. You never saw a shiftless, indifferent man with a good ty of crop or stock around him. I have lived nearly half a century never to my knowledge did I see one. In order to have a good of animals about you, well bred, well kept and well trained, you first have a good man who is a successful manager, regardless of Dior or nationality, you will see examples of that every day of your tWe all can accomplish great things if we will exert our energy in right direction. As an illustration of our possibilities let me cite to Tom Bass who educates saddle horses. He is a colored gentle - . When Tom Bass leads a horse into the ring they all take their off. It has been possible for a colored man to get the credit that men on earth today have acquired in the line of educating and ling saddle horses, for he has surpassed most of them. And if he </seg>
            <seg id="p163">162 can do it surely we ought to be able to do it; but we go along in the same old way without accomplishing anything. I have often heard men complaining about their horses, and about our system of registration, and about certain parties feathering their neat and pocketing the money, while the facts are that the State has cut off such persons opportunity for illegally feathering their own nest. There may be exceptions, but that is the rule. Every one of you know it. I have heard men (they are not attending this meeting) complain about our inspection and about the way in which our registration is carried on, that it was unfair, and sometimes those complaints come from men who apparently have quite a little influence and personality, men who I would liked to have had respect for, but the more I investi - gate them the less regard and respect I have for them. I have often investigated such cases and find it to be so. You ask their neighbors, friends or associates the kind or grade of horses they handle, and you find they have a lot of unsound stock. Without any exception that has been my experience. Every man I can now think of that has com - plained of our present plan of registration is a man who wants some - thing for nothing, and because you will not stoop to his level he is against you. But for the sake of our profession and this industry and our state we cannot afford to take a step backward. After we have perfected our law an 1 have given It a good test you will all find that the benefits derived from it are unspeakable. Of course there will al - ways be more or less criticism. We criticise the other fellow and he criticises us. However none of us are perfect, and we like to sing our own praises, for in truth we have all made mistakes, but if we will all take this matter in hand, and thoroughly investigate our horses, and the other fellow's horses, It will stimulate a better disposition on the part of every one to raise a better horse and be a better man. The horse dealer will make more money out of his profession honestly and less dis - honestly. Disnonesty invariably comes from the poorer classes, who handle the lower grades of horses. Without attempting to bore you I will now give way to others who may have something to say. (Ap plause.) Chairman Howard: We have listened to the able speakers on our new registration law, and from the interest and attention you gave, I am sure much good has been accomplished. I have been all over this state and am fairly well acquainted with the stallion situation, and since hearing these remarks I am more than ever in favor of uphold - ing this stallion law. I believe if we had had this law ten years ago we today would have double our present number of high grade horses. I am in favor of anything that will give us better horses. Since I spoke to you this morning I have come to the conclusion that we are at the very beginning of a draft horse famine in this state, and I hope this law will have a tendency to make us raise high grade draft horses. We live in the center of a great agricultural country. We can raise all that the other states raise, and with our wonderful possibili- </seg>
            <seg id="p164">STALLION REGISTRATION 30AKD 163 ties in alfalfa the horse and cattle problem ought to be solved for all time to come. I As you know, I live in Pawnee county, a very rich country, ad- Ing the Kansas line and 40 miles from Missouri. You can blind - me and take me to the borders of my county and I could find my home, and I make the assertion that there is not -one draft horse awnee county for sale worth the money — not one gelding. I do not w of one good marketable, low down, wide out, good middle, geld - for sale worth the money, and if there was I would surely be there uy it, but I can find any number of those tall things, 19 hands high an inch and a half wide. Have any of you any questions you wish to ask? Mr. Don Gridley, Humbolt: I do not want to be classed a* a knocker, but I really do think the law might be improved. What if any effect will this law have on increasing the type of draft horse that we want? Does the present law as we have it get the type of horses that is producing this class of horses? If it does, well and good, if it does not where are we better off than we were before? Dr. J. S. Anderson: It will tend to bring about the class of horses Mr. Howard talked about. We cannot step directly from our present condition into that higher class of horses referred to by Mr. Gridley, but this is a step in the right direction. We do not attempt to say the law is not defective, but by living up to the law we will gradually improve our condition. That is my attitude in the matter. Having bred un - soundness does not mean that we ought to continue. By weeding out the poor ones we will improve the breed of horses. If we would at - tempt to destroy all the stallions that are unsound or undesirable, also the mares, we could not stand the expense and loss. We would be mobbed if we would attempt it. I believe with Prof. Smith, that we will find after a while our law will not be strong enough. It will need amending. Our ambition should be to get sound horses and eliminate the unsound ones. Some men will say that periodic opthalmia predis - poses to unsoundness. I can take you to a man's place within two miles of my home where a mare that went blind two years ago gave birth to a colt that had one blind eye, there was no pupil and the iris looked like the bottom of an ordinary saucer. I can take you to an - other one of the same kind. It is not only probable, but it is almost positive that sooner or later the diseases will be reproduced, and there - by get unsound stock; and I believe that as soon as the stallions be - come unsound they should not be permitted to stand. This law it a step in the right direction. It is not right that we should be allowed to breed mares when unsound. How will you eliminate it? Breed to a jack, and then yru get an unsound mule. (Applause.) Mr. Dan Gridley: We will eliminate the unsoundness but we will not eliminate the improper conformation. As far as I know, it might be probable that in Pawnee county, or in Richardson county where I live there may not be one horse that was rejected, and there might be, but suppose there was not, how is that law going to affect this situation? </seg>
            <seg id="p165">164 Kwill we get the right conformation under this law? I do not think »n do it. Prof. H. R. Smith: It is not the purpose of the law to be educa - tional. The law is simply to regulate the things which can be regulat - ed by law. There is no question but what we need a betteT horse than we have, but that will have to come through a different way. It will have to come through education, education of the public. The law as passed, protects the public. The average man who breeds horses does not know sidebones and those various defects — at least, many do not, and they must be pointed out by someone who does know. At the same time the average man does not know whether a horse is grade or pure bred. As I said, the law is to protect these men, but when it comes to improving the size and conformation that will have to come very large - ly through educational means. What we want today is a full discus - sion. There is no question but what it is possible to improve this law. There is every probability it will be improved by the next legislature. We want you to ask questions and bring out points so the next time the legislature meets they can improve it. We want the law improved, and we want this law to be the best law it is possible for us to have in this state. We want it fully discussed. Mr. H. Beck: I wish to say a word in regard to a recent ruling of the board. I have had several stallions inspected. * I have a stallion that cost me $1600 that got out of his stall and became lame and was inspected thereafter. In his inspection statement he said the horse had a bone spavin. I did not believe he had and took the matter up with the board and they gave me the privilege of picking a man, and they to pick one provided I would put up $50 to guarantee expenses in case I was wrong. I first proposed that I would pay for the examination If they would send a men there to examine him. I did not know what they required. Now, where I think the board did not use me right was in turning the old affidavit made by the first inspector over to the man they had appointed to make the second examination. I thought they ought to let this man go there and make the examination Independent of any knowledge derived from the first man, and make the examina - tion independent of anything but his own personal examination. Prof. Smith: What was the decision? »Mr. Pert: We have not yet had a decision. They picked their and I picked mine, and the two men were to meet here today and a third man. ■ Prof. Smith: We turned over the affidavit of the first man to second man? Mr. Beck: Tea Prof. Smith: The second man ought to work without any assis Mr. Beck. That is the only fault I found with the stallion law. Prof. Smith: That is not the fault of the law. Mr. Beck. It is the fault of the board. Prof. Smith: That is right. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">165 I Mr. Beck: The horse was lame when this man inspected it. He out of his stall the night before and got a little piece of a nail in foot that I had not discovered when the examination was made. I ected the man for making the affidavit he did, for I believe he was est, but I criticise the board for giving his findings to the second i. He should find out for himself what the trouble may be with horse. Dr. J. C. Bowman, Tecumseh: If they told this man to go there how will he decide whether this other man was wrong or not? if they decide whether this man was wrong. They would have to know what this lameness was before they decide against him. They would have to override his decision about its being a bone spavin. They might find something else and they might overlook its being a bone spavin. If my attention was not called to it I might overlook this bone spavin and look at the foot: The idea is, when you override the decision you would have to call that man's attention to that affidavit. That is the only way you can override it. iNow in regard to faulty conformation of horses. If I were inspect - 1,000 head of horses for this Stallion Registration Board, I would lemn at least 25 per cent of them on faulty conformation. Serious cts in conformation as this gentleman said: 19 hands high and inches wide, should disqualify him. There are many like that. ouB defects in conformation would then be faulty conformation. If mporter brought horses with faulty conformation into the state I was inspecting them I could condemn every one of them. How - , this law will stop them coming into the state and being raised and within the state. In order to get the big horse you must breed or import him. Mr. Beck: I am not handling any runty horses. The horse I re - ferred to is a draft horse, and he was shown in Denver last winter, and he went out of the Denver ring as a prize winning horse. tMr. C. S. Rees: In the western part of the state many of our lers are using grade horses on their own ranches but they do not them to breed their neighbor's horses. They use them for their private purpose only. Do they come under the law? tProf. Smith: I will read you the section: "Every owiler or keeper ly stallion or jack kept for public service, every owner or keeper of stallion or Jack kept for sale, exchange or transfer who represents stallion or jack to be fit for service, and every owner or keeper of stallion or jack kept for sale, exchange or transfer shall procure rtincate, etc." That does not include It. I Mr. Beck. In regard to ordering horses to come a great distance the purpose of inspection. Out in the western part of the state they often required to come a distance of 20 miles and more, and they obliged to remain over night in a small town where there are no ac - odations, and I would like to know if our law compels us to bring horses to certain towns named by the board, or wTiether, if we r to pay the transportation of the Inspector to that place from the </seg>
            <seg id="p167">166 town designated by the board, or furnish an automobile or other con - veyance, whether he will come? I think if we are willing to furnish the transportation he ought to come where the stallion or horse is. tProf. Smith: The inspection towns are about 20 miles apart, and presumed to be 30 miles across country to another railroad town. e matters will have our attention. i.Mr. Wm. Ball, Auburn: I would like to ask a question of the gen - an who was speaking about inspection. If a horse had been •cted early in the fall, and has been working for exercise imme - ly prior to that inspection, and is thin in flesh, not up to the tge in weight, and the inspection is taken at that time, does the al weight of that horse in his worked down condition have to ar on his bill the next season when he is 300 to 400 pounds heav - }r can the owner have the weight changed to conform to the facts? I would also like to ask another question. If a colt, for instance, coming two years old, that has not been recorded, and his weight is taken, which is probably 300 pounds lighter than he will be at the be - ginnig of the breeding season the next spring: the colt has not been recorded, but is supposed to be eligible and supposed to be recorded between the time of inspection and putting him on the stand, will you have to place a certificate or a bill or poster on the door where the stallion is kept giving the weight as 300 pounds less than the colt at that time actually weighs? I Prof. Smith: The law does not provide that the weight of the I shall be placed on the certificate. I will ask Mr. Nelson, the As - lt Secretary who looks after these matters, to answer that question. Mr. A. E. Nelson: We have always told the men in cases like this to sign an affidavit, when they thought the weight was not correct, and send it together with the license to us and we would change the license and return it to them. We realize that sometimes a horse is a little thin when the inspection is made. At first we did not require this affi - davit. Some would write in and say, probably a month after the ex - amination had taken place, and the papers were returned to them, that the horse weighed much more, in fact very much more than our friend here stated, and much more than he could possibly gain in that time: and so we required an affidavit. If any stallion owner had his horse Inspected some time ago and the weight today is incorrect, if he will sign an affidavit before a Notary Public, giving the exact weight to date, and return it with his license we will change the weight on the Now, regarding horses that are pure breds and have not been re - corded. The only way we have of knowing whether or not a horse is a pure bred is by the papers sent in. That is absolutely the only way. If a stallion is accepted by any of these recognized associations as pure breds and he shows to be a pure bred, the papers are accepted by the board. If there are no papers to show him to be a pure bred then they are not accepted as such. These "pedigrees" come in to us in various </seg>
            <seg id="p168">167 forms. We have received them written on the back of book paper; one came in written on a part of a match box; one came in on a piece of ordinary scratch paper; and some have come in nicely type-written. They will have a nice long name — probably a French one, with a num - ber, but when you examine them you find that the sire and dam are not recorded and the "pedigree" does not give the breed of the horse. The only way we can tell whether or not a man will get a pure bred license for a pure bred horse is by getting the papers for a pure bred horse. Mr. Beck: Under our present law we have to send in our pedi - grees so they can take the number and society they are recorded in, and that handicaps some of us in selling horses. I know in our com - munity horses were examined the 21st of last October the pedigrees were sent in and they have not yet been returned. I wrote for mine after they were in 30 days and they were sent me. That often handicaps us in selling our horses, and we think they are held too long. The inspector is supposed to know these societies and which is good or bad, and if he took the numbers and sent them in, could it not be fixed ud so that they would answer just as well, and we could retain our papers? ■ Prof. Smith: I do not see any reason why that could not be done, I think the law would have to be modified. Mr. Beck: I mean by amending the law. Prof. Smith: It would have to *be amended. .Mr. Beck: 1 do not think that amendment would do any harm. Mr. Nelson: If your certificates are recorded in the stud book, you will find on the back of them a little red stamp which says, "In - spected and examined by the Nebraska Stallion Registration Board," and then comes the date. When that stamp is on your certificate it never needs to come back into our office. Last year when the office was opened there were three letters left in the bottom of a file, and that was the beginning of the Nebraska Stallion Registration Board, about the first of September. Now there are twelve clerks working all the time. There was an immense amount of work, and many details to be looked after in order to get the work systematized, and for that reason some papers have been delayed, but they are in safe keeping and will soon be sent out. When they are stamped on the back it does not make any difference who buys that horse or who owns him, when you find that stamp on the back you may know the certificate is good. Mr. Beck: A man told me last night that he had a horse sold, but could not produce the papers, and finally had to let him come home. He had the horse sold provided he could produce the papers. That handicaps the horse dealer. I think something should be done to get them back to us sooner. » Chairman Howard: In giving a statement of the pedigree of your e, if you haven't it with you, you can guarantee it to be as you , and let the customer go home, and he can take your word for it, at soon as you get the pedigree from the Board you can send it to </seg>
            <seg id="p169">168 ANNUAL REPORT §1 sold a horse weeks ago and I knew the certificate was all right, here but I guaranteed it, and the man took my word and took the away with him. KMr. A. E. Walter: I would like to inquire what Is a curby forma - of hock. Dr. J. S. Anderson: It is a hock that is not properly supported, or balanced. The width of the hock may be good, but not well sup - ported. As an illustration. You put a support under one corner of a building only and you havn't a good support. You must put the support under all parts. If you have a hock that is only supported at one-third, or one-half, or three-fourths, and the balance not well supported you have a curby formation. Mr. B. F. Moore: In issuing certificates to people, does not the law provide the different diseases? If a horse has any of these defects and is marked so that the man who breeds can see what he is breeding to, would it not be better? I have not seen the law; it says it shall be marked. It occurs to me that if people want to raise better horses they ought to know what they want to breed to, and that should settle the question. In the course of 10 or 15 years we would have bttter horses than we now have. Horse owners would not have to dis - t.fse of them for nothing because they had these defects. In time you wculd not have horses with the/e defects at all. So I say if there was a diagram of the horse on the certificate as indicated it would be better. Mr. Wm. Ball: There is one question in regard to the type of horses. It occurs to me that in this law there is no provision regarding the type of the horse that these horse buyers might be guided by in se - lecting Btallions for public service, as there may be many of us who are not qualified and do not know the required type of draft horse to buy when we come to make our selection, etc, and could that not be handled in the way of sending out to the people of Nebraska that are in the horse breeding business a type fully describing the height, weight, general build, etc, of the horse that is the type of horse that the market or the country requires? Would that not be beneficial to the breeders and prospective buyers of Nebraska more than to make laws to compel them to buy such a type of horse when they are not qualified to judge? It appears to me that this Board would have a per - fect right to mark off and have printed the type of the horse and give the required length between joints, the width of bone that forms the foundation of the animal, the general conformation, etc, in order to educate the prospective buyer. Chairman Howard: I think I have the gentleman's idea and know how he feels about the matter. I agree with him, but I would express myself in a different way. I have not given this law very much thought, but it occurs to me if you want tc judge a horse from an individual standpoint that we would judge him from a score card standpoint, and allow so many points to each part of the horse, such as the eye. </seg>
            <seg id="p170">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 169 ear, mouth, etc, and say that 100 points would be perfect. I do not pretend to eay now how many points he should have to pass, but (or Illustration we would say he would have to score 80 or 85 points. It occurs to me that would be a good way to score a stallion and get his Individuality. We might say 1800 pounds or a ton should be the stan - dard weight of a draft horse. Anything below that would cut off so many per cent, or if he showed curby hock we could cut off so many points and if he showed spavin or ringbone or sidebone we would cut off so many points, but he would have to score 80 points to pass. I offer this as a suggestion. While I have the floor I want to say one more word about this stallion law, and particular about the winding of the horses. I had four inspectors at my place and they merely asked my boy to walk them down the street 50 yards and trot back. We can't get off that kind of wind on the market. That will not pass. If you do anything, do it right. If you are going to wind a horse, then wind it, and when you stamp it good wind make it stand for good wind, and if his wind is not good, say it is not good wind. This idea of walking them half a block and trotting them back at the end of a halter would not do in New York or Philadelphia. If that is the right way to wind them I am in favor of it. I am not a knocker, but a booster, but that is not the war I get my horses winded, and I do not think our state inspectors ought to let them off so easy. We should do everything right when we do it. Be sure you are right and then go ahead. Dr. DeCow: I ask if it is advisable in testing the wind of a heavy hor«e weighing 2000 or 2200 pounds to run him down the road three or four hundred yards and back, barefoot, in order to know whether you are purchasing a sound horse? It is possible to test his wind with - out moving him out of his tracks. There are other ways of finding out whether or not the horse is windy. If a stallion whinnies will he not tell you whether or not he is windy? I do not think it is necessary to move a horse a yard. I know personally I would not make any fat stallion trot too far. Another thing, there is a considerable difference between a windy horse and a horse that is excessively fat. You will invariably find a horse weighing a ton that he is just a little bit wheezy just like fat men. So many farmers and horse men and horse buyers will call a horse that wheezes windy, especially when they are buying him and want to bush the man a little bit. I Mr. Howard: I have never been able to put a horse up in the -ket for sale and let him go through by merely letting him whinny. re is one rule to go by, he has either good wind or bad wind. You it draw the line. I do not care if he weighs 1000 or 2000 pounds, has good wind or he has bad wind. There is no question about this, man can tell a windy horse without running him for his wind. I e these signs to go by. I hardly stop with merely looking at a &gt;e. and hear him whinny, and watch him breathe; but to make a tare , I want to run him to the top of his speed two or three blocks. He indy or not, and you cannot draw any line on the fat or poor horse. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">170 Pw: I wish to make one additional remark. As I under - it does not say anything about windiness. It says laryn - ;ia. I will ask the opinion of a man who has no equal on liplegia, or who has no superior in the United States. I hear from Dr. Anderson on that. I Dr. Anderson: I am glad to see Mr. Howard and Dr. DeCow and rs discuss this matter, because it interests me and every other horse- This question is asked me a great many times, and I definitely ie roaring or whistling, laryngeal hemiplegia. I have been called ! or four or five hundred miles to operate on a horse that was re - d as too windy, and when I arrived there I found upon examination he was windy. A horse may be ever; so sound and at the same have a manner of holding his head in a way that he chokes elf. Mr. Howard: When you test a horse for his wind, if he blows only from the nostril you pass him for good wind, if he blows clear from the nostril? Dr. Anderson: No. You take a bass horn and let a man blow in at the little end and the noise will come out at the large end. And, thic illustrates my point with reference to the horse. The noise only has one place to come out at, and that is at the nostrils. The noise may be down pretty well in the throat or in the anterior portion of the air chambers. You will find many defective things in connection with the breathing apparatus of a horse, but the one referred to In this law is laryngeal hemiplegia. The explanation of it is this: It is a paralysis of the muscle that tenses the vocal cords in the larynx. If they are drawn tight, or pulled to the sides, the air passes in or out without mak - ing any noise, but if the muscles that tense these things or retract them does not act properly they hang across there loosely and they make a noise like a sliver in the crack of a barn. The vibrations produced in that way make a noise. It is emitted at the nostril, and it Is an easy matter to mistake a noisy windy horse for a horse suffering with laryn - geal hemiplegia when he hasn't any trouble in the larynz at all. In examining stallions and passing them or turning them down on this ground is rather a treacherous thing. I have passed some and t expect criticism, but I did it with conscience, and am not ashamed of my actions. I would like to have every one who owns a horse to speak of these matters and we will settle them agreeably. I have In mind one particular horse, a large one weighing 2100 or 2200 pounds, the kind of a horse that Mr. Howard described to us. That horse in a sense is windy; he makes a noise when you trot him from here to the door, at the same time he would not pass in the market. Mr. Howard would not buy him; but the explanation is this: This horse has been entered in the stud book some 12 or 14 years. I do not know his age, but he has been kept very fat during this time — he is immensely fat, and the thickness of the fat from the skin to the nearest rib is several inches, and of course he is windy. But you take old men who are fleshy when they lie down to sleep they usually make a noise and they are not necessarily </seg>
            <seg id="p172">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 171 windy. Old stallions do the same thing. They become (at in the throat; every part of their anatomy is fatty; the vocal cords and all of the little mucous membranes that make up the intricate structure of the larynx is involved, and there is the inclination to make a noise. I pass a horse of that kind unless I think there is paralysis. I would condemn a young horse quicker than an old one. The young horse that develops It is to be turned down in preference to the old one. Professor Smith in reading the Minnesota law presented a good idea. As he said the Minnesota law provided that after the horse is ten years of age or over he is exempt from examination. Old horses, as well as old men, are not quite as sound as they were once, but maybe they are better sires than the younger ones. (Applause.) Prof. Smith: In regard to incorporating into the law something that would encourage better conformation and better size, there is only one state law that incorporates the word conformation and that is Pennsylvania. I believe I am right in saying that we have the only state law which d'soualifies a stallion for serious defects in conforma - tion, and it is in harmony with the suggestion that was made, and I be - lieve it is right. I believe one speaker said here this afternoon that the law should provide for some encouragement to size and conformation. In the future it is to be hoped that the law will make it possible to pro - vide certain standards as to conformation and size. But at the present time there is enough knocking as it is. If you would shut out stallions for. slight defects in conformation you would have a still harder time. This will have to come later. But we hope that in the future we will give better and more attention to the question of conformation and size. There are a few more minutes left and we would like to hear from others on this question. Prof. G. L. Carlson: I am glad that question was raised. This law was not intended to be an educational measure, but one for promo - tion and advancement. As others have raised the question as to how the averpde m-"n of the country wi'l know how to select his sires. I be - lieve a few moments could be profitably spent in discussing it. I do not think we could ever pass a law, and I do not think we will, that will afford much assistance in that direction. But you men here today, and others to whom you can carry the word can do much in that direc - tion by aiming to get or establish a standard by which draft horses are to be judged. I take this from reports I receive, and from going round over the country. A great many young men come to me for advice or information as to what stallion to buy or select. T.hey say, we cannot learn anything at the fairs. If you will study the decisions of the judging of horses at our fairs you will find there has been very little that is really educational. That is perhaps more true of the county fair than of the large shows. Mr. Howard has told you of the requirements of the buyer regardless of breed. He wants size, he wants ruggedness of constitution, he wants plenty bone of good quality, he —.-in •. ai /-»ni n tr ch mi 1 H pt* ft n H ft Ion c iinriprlinf 1 ftnd h p w&amp;n ts ft sood </seg>
            <seg id="p173">172 ANNUAL REPORT elastic pastern and a bock well supported. There is very little in the breed. It would be very easy for our fair association managers, and the agricultural colleges together, to establish a standard by which all draft horses regardless of breed could be judged, and it would be a few years only until the young men of the country would have something by which they could go out and buy a horse under. I do not Ihink we will ever solve it any other way. It can be done through the fair asso - ciation. When a young man goes out to the fair and sees judging done he takes it for granted that it is a good horse because he is well aired. He then goes to another fair and he sees another type. This should be remedied, and they should get it through the agricultural Mr. Frank Howard: I am glad Prof. Carlson volunteered this in - formation. That is what our meeting is for, and we want to discuss everything pertaining to this business. The discussion has been very thorough and I for one have received many valuable suggestions, and you doubtless will say the same. We are all of the opinion that we want better horses. I sell my horses to men who are fine judges of horses, and I learn many good lessons by so doing, and if you will get on the train and go down to St. Louis or Chicago or New York, or go to some nearby horse market, and watch the big draft horses sell, and study the requirements, you will get lessons that will be of value to you when you come to buy your stallion. We raise horses, cattle and hogs for the money there is in them, and as I said we want to raise what salts the other fellow. And so far as this law regulating stallions is concerned I believe we all agree that it is a good one. This is the first time I ever put in as much time at a meeting of this kind in my life, and it has been a constant round of pleasure, an.1 I wish there was more practical horsebuyers here, for they would say "amen" to wha* I have told you. There is not only a shortage, but there are hardly tny draft horses in the country. I was talking to one of my friends, Mr. \P. B. Blair of Indianapolis, Ind.. I sell him a great many horses, and he says, "go out and buy those big horses regardless of cost when you can find the right kind, and I will take them off your hands." He said he had an order for one hundred head and he hadn't even one horse in the stall; and he makes a specialty of draft horses. I was asked by Mr. Nugents of St. Louis by letter to buy all the big draft horses I could get as he said they have more orders than they could fill from New Tork, Boston and Philadelphia. I also have letters from Fitxdorrell ft Carroll of New York of similar import. They tell me to buy good horses and they will see that I get good money for them. Gentlemen, you do not know the situation. We are about to enter a draft horse famine. I believe that will conclude this part of the program. 1 Chairman Howard: We have w'th us today. Mr. Odell. the Secre - of the Nebraska Farmer's Congress, of Lincoln, who has some - ; of interest that he desires to bring to our attention, after which </seg>
            <seg id="p174">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 173 we will enter into the judging contest. I now introduce to you Mr. Mr. Odell: The other day when the thermometer showed 28 de - grees below zero, 400 representatives from 85 counties of Nebraska met •t Omaha in the Nebraska Country Life Congress, and among other things adopted the following resolutions. These resolutions have been adopted by the Farmers Grain and Livestock State Co-operative Asso - ciation, by the The Nebraska Farmer's Congress; by The Nebraska Country Life Congress, and they were adopted this morning by the State Association of County Superintendents who are now in session at the Capitol; and this afternoon they were adopted by the Womens' Home Economics Association; also the Good Roads Association; and they have Just been adopted by the Corn Improvers' Association. They are as follows: PARCELS POST t Whereas, The United States has agreements with more than a ? of foreign countries permitting packages weighing up to eleven ids to be mailed at any point in the United States to points on opposite side of the world at the rate of twelve cents per pound t Whereas, The limit for packages of fourth class mail matter een points in the United States is four pounds and the rate en cents per pound, thereby charging the American citizen six - cents more for sending a four-pound package from his local post - &gt; to his nearest neighboring postoffice than it charges for the same age to the farthest part of the world, therefore, be it t Resolved, That this congress demands that the senators and rep - ltatives in congress from the state of Nebraska support a country - ', unlimited parcels-post law that will give to the American citixen same advantage in trading with his fellow citizens which he now ys in his trade relations with foreigners. EDUCATION. First — The Rural School. tWe favor the teaching of higher grades in the rural school, where inded, until such time as we secure the consolidation of rural ols; the consolidated schools to be established in the country and, •e possible, to have a high school department, offering vocational ing, particularly in agriculture, farm mechanics and domestic ce. ■ We disapprove of any scheme of aid for high schools in cities towns under the guise of advancing agriculture through the teach - of agricultural subjects, unless the advantages are offered to the </seg>
            <seg id="p175">174 ANNUAL REPORT rural community in encouragement of consolidation which will tend to give the farmer's child equal advantages with the child of the city, and teach the children of the farms in the terms and amid the sur - roundings of the life which they are expected to live. Second — The High School. I We recognize that the country teachers come ,in large measure, the high schools of the towns and cities, and that their fitness nds largely upon the education' which they receive in these schools, gnizing the dominant nature of agriculture- in the life of Ne - ka, we call upon the Department of Public Education to exercise powers vested in that department to the end that practical agri - iral subjects and vocational training be incorporated in the courses udy of the high schools in the towns and cities, to the end that teaching force shall be more fully equipped for their important in the rural school. We Relieve that the laws now in force give the departments of public education full power to meet this requirement. Should the laws now in force prove insufficient for this purpose, we pledge our aid and influence to such reasonable amendment of such laws and shall accom - plish this declared purpose; provided, that equal recognition be given to the consolidation and development of the rural school. Third — The University. I We commend the important and valuable scientific and experi - tal work done by the University of Nebraska in the interest of farmer; especially in the school and college of agriculture and carrying of popular education to the people through the depart - t of agriculture extension; and we pledge our support and co - ation for the university. t Recognizing the imperative necessity of the education of the ler in the business side of farming, we express our cordial approval endorsement of the work of the department of farm management ie University of Nebraska. We realize, however, that the problems arising from the rela - tions between producer and consumer demand more equitable rela - tions, and the education of the farmer in better and more economical methods of distribution. We wish to go on record as believing that this phase of business education is fully as important and timely as education in better methods of production. tWe, therefore, request the chancellor and the board of regents ie University of Nebraska that they take such measures as may to them proper to establish in connection with the school and je of agriculture, and with the departments of agriculture, exten - and farm management, divisions for the study of agricultural &gt;mics, with special reference to the conditions under which crops </seg>
            <seg id="p176">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 175 ' are sold, and methods of practical operation among farmers in mar - keting, distribution, banking and credit. tWe further recommend to the authorities of the university that results of this study be embodied as rapidly as possible in the [ of the department of agricultural extension, through the ium of bulletins, farmers' institutes and short courses, to the end practical business education be disseminated as rapidly and thor - ily as possible among the farming population. We recognize that in the college of agriculture, more than in any other college of the university, it is imperative that members of the faculty of such colleges should have a personal acquaintance with people in all parts of the state, as well as with climatic and agri - cultural conditions in all portions of the state, and that such acquaint - ance cannot be acquired in a few years; and we most strongly urge that a member of the faculty of such college, having acquired such acquaintance, thereby becoming in a much larger measure useful and helpful to the university and to the people of the state, should not be suffered to sever his connection with the university by reason of a tender of an increase in salary by a university in another state. SPKCl'LATIVE INVESTMENTS. t Whereas, a large proportion of the investment propositions now 3d to the public are of the speculative and doubtful character, bing vast amounts of money belonging to un-informed and inno - investors to the serious detriment of every legitimate form of ess and industry, and Whereas, a considerable proportion of these doubtful enterprises are speculative land-selling schemes which cannot be reasonably expected to yield profitable returns upon their fictitious capitalization, which is reflected in corresponding increase in the price of agricul - tural lands in sections where permanent agriculture has passed beyond the experimental stage; such speculation and consequent rise in prices imposing an added and unnecessary burden both upon the producer and the consumer and increasing the difficulty of securing a home, therefore, be it I Resolved, That this etmgnm sets the seal of its disapproval jhatically upon all forms of speculation of this character, and par - ilarly upon such as are based upon speculation in lands which tend absorb the earnings of Nebraska farmers and reduce our agricul - il population, and be' it further Resolved, That the legislative committees of the bodies repre - sented in this congress be instructed to co-operate with the director of conservation of the State of Nebraska in preparing a bill for intro - duction at the next session of the legislature providing for registra- </seg>
            <seg id="p177">176 ANNUAL REPORT seekin gto do business in this state, and the examination of the busi - ness standing and reliability of such concerns and the investments they offer, where such investigation may be required. The concurrence by this body is asked for in connection with the Dr. A. Bostrom: I move the adoption of these resolutions as read by Mr. Odell. The motion was seconded, put and unanimously carried, and the Chairman declared them adopted. Prof. Smith: It was suggested that it would now be an opportune moment to organize a Nebraska stallion owners association, or what might be more appropriately termed the Nebraska Horse Breeders' Association. There will be no fee connected with it. Your member - ship in the Live Stock Association will entitle you to membership in the Nebraska Horse Breeders' Association. In view of the situation that has been outlined by Mr. Howard and others It would be Well to have some organization intended to promore the horse breeding in - dustry of this state, and to discuss such questions as you have been dis - cussing this afternoon, and I would like to get the sentiment of this body as to the advisability of organizing at this time what might be called the Nebraska Horse Breeders' Association which would include the mare owners as well as the stallion owners. What is the feeling of you gentlemen? Mr. A. E. Nelson: In order to advertise this meeting more effec - tively we have caused to be sent to various farmers and horse-breeders throughout the state this Special Horse Program advertising this meet - ing, and at the bottom of the bulletin we inserted the following: "You are invited to be present at the organization of the Nebraska Stallion and Jack Owners Association immediately following the Tuesday pro - gram." Since then people have come to us and talked about this, and they are very largely of the opinion that we should not exclude the men who are also mare owners, which is generally speaking the ordinary farmers. I believe it would be a good idea if we could get together, form an association of that kind and hold our annual meetings and publish the proceedings thereof in connection with the report of the Stallion Registration Board ; and that we should publish such articles and information as would promote and advance the horse industry in this state. I Prof. Rail: I do not know how many of you were here this morn - and heard Mr. Howard make his remarks' on the feeding of horses the market, and the particular value of the draft horse. I do not how there can be any disposition to criticise the suggestions that dvanced this morning to the effect that the draft horse is the horse ought to be raised in this state; and also the tremendous signifl - ■e In connection with that is the statement that he made of the real </seg>
            <seg id="p178">STALLION REGISTRATION UOAHD 177 scarcity of that sort of horse in Nebraska. When he asked if any man knew of half a dozen draft horses for sale in their respective counties to make it known, not one instance was brought to light. I do not know how fully it has been brought out here today, but I make the assertion without fear of contradiction that there is no country, and no state in the United States that is better adapted to the production and propagation of draft horses than the state of Nebraska. We have the climate that makes good horses; we hare the soil that raises good horses, and the cheapest feed that is produced anywhere. If you have the climate, soil and feed, then the remaining fourth element is brains. You men know that Nebraska as far as educational statistics and facil - itits are concerned has a lower percentage of illiteracy than any other state in the Union; therefore there is no dispute but what we have Cue brains, and these four elements when combined will produce something worth while. But if you do not know where you are, and if you do not have a definite purpose in mind the combination of all the factors in the wcrld will not amount to anything; and organized effort is what we want. Do you know the value of the horses in this state? Do you know how many horses we have in this state? The 1910 report of the State Board of Agriculture places the value of the horses of this state at fifty - seven million dollars. Now, you heard what Mr. Howard said about the value of the 1150 pound horses and the possible profit in them? If you was raising the right kind of horses they would be worth at least one hundred and twenty million dollars, and the cost of feeding them would if anything be less than what it costs to feed our present inferior grades, and they would be paying you a handsome interest on your investment. Not only that, the earning capacity of the one hundred and twenty million dollars would be real and not theoretical. I have been in and down this state in the last three or four years in connection with the work at the State Farm, in judging county fairs over the eastern part of the state, and the infrequency with which I found what might be considered a good horse anywhere in this state has been a startling thing to me. a surprising fact. Having seen and visited the barns of the Illinois farmer and stock breeder, and having seen and visited them in various sections of Iowa, and then compared them with the barns and stables of Nebraska, one is forcibly impressed with the backward and unprogressive system at present in vogue in Nebraska. We are doing nothing in the horse breeding work. We are ■imply reproducing horses without any definite idea as to what they will be, or whether they will amount to anything. The only way to overcome this is for us to get together and improve our situation and lend encouragement to the man who wants to do something by placing better stallions in his neighborhood, and be getting betteY mares in your neighborhood. It is practically impossible for one man to attempt much, but it is the community interest that counts, and by getting to - gether we will accomplish much. I did not come here to make a talk but I have the interest of the horse-breeders and their work at heart. I have not written much, but </seg>
            <seg id="p179">178 ANNUAL REPORT PI have had inserted in the papers an article on horse breed- In mind some things that would improve it, as for example breeding in communities, and if this association was or - ■ould establish sections where definite work could be done, w of anything that would result in greater efficiency, or momentum to it than an organization which will bring to - nly the stallion and jack owners but the mare owners as Prof. Carlson: This question was brought up last year. We failed to organise, but we should not let this opportunity go by without doing something, and to save delay, I move that the Chairman appoint a committee of three men to take this matter up as to time and place for this organization which is to be known as the Nebraska Horse Breed - en' Association. IMr. Beck: I suggest that Prof. Carlson add to his motion that Chairman of this meeting, Mr. Howard, act in conjunction with e three men, and with that added, I second the motion. Prof. Carlson: I will incorporate that in my motion. Chairman Howard then put the motion, and said: I This institution is lame on the horse end. Mr. Smith has the cattle of it, but the horse end of it is not being advanced as it should, in favor of going out and buying a carload of horses for the state ebraska, and let the state use them and demonstrate with them, they cannot help but make money, and they can then show the g men of this state what we are doing. I can make more money ne horse than I would give for that steer that stands over there to the window. Mr. Johnson: I put the first stallion in this state in the year 1874. IThe motion was then unanimously carried, and the Chairman ap - ed the following committee to act in conjunction with himself in lizing the Nebraska Horse Breeders' Association: Dr. A. Bostrom, State Veterinarian, Dr. J. S. Anderson, Seward, Prof. Howard Gramlich, University of Nebraska K Chairman Howard: The next number on the program is a Horse ing Demonstration by Prof Howard Gramlich, of the State Uni - ty of Nebraska. Prof. Howard Gramlich: The hour is getting late and we will not have much time for demonstration, as we have two classes of horses to - be judged. At the time this program was made up I did not know that Prof. Carlson would be here during the afternoon, when they asked me to give a horse judging demonstration. Prof Carlson knows more about a horse than I could ever expect to know in a life time, and I will ask Dr. Carlson to kindly act in my stead, and as one of our horses is now in the pavlllion I will ask Dr. Carlson to give you a few practi - cal pointers about this horse, and point out to you where he is deficient and where he is proficient. </seg>
            <seg id="p180">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 179 HORSE JUDGING DEMONSTRATION By Prof. G. L. Carlson, Norfolk. I The horse in which I am now demonstrating belongs to the e Farm and la doubtless familiar to many of the students. The thing the buyer cares to know is the age, hence we look in the ith. The breeder does not care so much for age. Then we notice general conformation, soundness and quality. As breeders we do care much about the age, however it is well to know the age of horse, and how to tell the age. Then see that he has a good eye. i horse has a remarkably good eye. There is an eye that will never wrong unless you knock It out; and such an eye is not often seen I is somewhat of a hazel-gray. We find that periodic opthalmia prevails so much seems to have a taste for the slightly blue eye, we seldom see it in an eye such as this. I could improve the eye a little in expression, especially over the top, a little cleaner cut. not very expressive. I Another thing we generally overlook in a horse, and it is quite luable thing, is its intelligence. This is indicated by the size "f orehead, or in other words, the distance between the eyes, and the nee between the eyes and ears or the height of the forehead, tively speaking the brain capacity of the horse is small, but the ire or quality is remarkably good, being next to that of man. The &gt;r the brain the more intelligence we find. The brain being lo - 1 here, the intelligence would be indicated by the brain capacity een the eyes and immediately above. This horse is above the age in intelligence, but we can improve him somewhat. He could lightly wider between the eyes. The head is very good, but I Id like it fuller in there. As to the ear, in judging the quality of the horse we pay consid - erable ai'ention to the ear. You never saw a very thick, short ear in a horse ttiat was nnt a little wanting in quality. We learn that in the thoroughbreds and the harness bred type. You notice in them the ear is slender, thin and pointed. This ear for a draft horse Is very good, better than the average. The carriage of the ear is excessive of a quality that we should not overlook, it shows the temperament. We find in the horse that carries his ears erect, that in every move - ment he makes we notice a slight movement of the ear. It is always very responsive to your command, and is something we should not overlook. While on the other hand if the ear is slightly drooped one way or the other we will find a sluggish temperament. In other words, with such a horse we find that we have to do considerable work in order to get results. As to the looks of the ear and its loca - tion on the head, if we find a horse narrow between the eyes and nar - row between the ears you will always have a timid horse, one shying at everything he sees. If we find a full head here we have an ex - pression of self-will or determination and you will find such a horse </seg>
            <seg id="p181">ANNUAL REPORT 180 dangerous when frightened; he pay* little attention to the bit and Is likely to go through a wall or over it. On the other hand, with width between the ears, we find courage, which is of great value in the horse, and fullness with width between the eyes gives us the best head of which we know". Now as to the nostril. The opening should be large in this horse I would have it larger than it is. The skin could be a little more refined, and show a little more quality. We notice that nature in - rariably harmonizes these things. If we have a large lung capacity we will always have a large nostril no matter what the genus to which the animal belongs. This is a little email, I even like the lip thin and refined which also indicates quality. One of the things Mr. Howard like* is a good big long mouth. The short mouth is generally associated with a poor feeder, a long deep mouth with a good feeder. The under lip should be refined and thin and the lips should be carried together. You often find horses when you work them with the lips apart and and slightly moving. If you ever see a horse of that kind, you will find one that along in the afternoon is looking for the barn, and he becomes tired very early in the day. If there Is determination you will find the lips together. Here we have a very good set of jaws and wide apart. Dr. Anderson said that was a good point, and I hope you will remember it. I like to see the jaws on a gelding thin at the bottom rather than thick, and in a stallion you will find them thick, which is an evidence of masculinity. The throat should be thin and clear. One of the essential points as we go back from the head to the body is a neck of reasonable length. We do not fine very many draft horses with necks too long. We do find a very few but they will be •••ociatel with the type that is 19 hands high and an inch and a half wide that Mr. Howard spoke of. But in a typical draft horse, com - pactly built, with good width, we seldom find a long neck. We like to see a good crest. The buyer is willing to pay a little extra money As we eo down underneath here, one of the essential th&lt;ngs about a horse is that he be well built down between the legs. I would like to see this horse four inches lower than he is. I wculd criticise him considerably in heart girth. If he was deeper here you would find he would be larger there. Remember that all the vital organs of this horse that have to do with life are located in here; so that a good heart girth tells us the whole story of the vitality of the horse. We find a tendency among some breeds, more than others, in the draft horses, to be quite wide in front and very badly cut up in between the legs, and it is with that type that we have trouble with the wind. We very seldom find defective wind if the horse is well filled down here, very deep for there we get the lung and heart capacity. Here is a thing I wish to call your attention to. I referred to it this morning, and will now illustrate it by this horse. I said very few </seg>
            <seg id="p182">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 181 come there on that horse. You will notice if you press your list in there, that is the only place he could draw easily. Put your fist fhere and you will gee the tendency is to work out over the bone all the time. You cannot get your collar too tight here against the neck. This horse, hae had a sore shoulder, because the collar was too loose and not properly fitted. They should fit as tight as possible against the neck. I do not care how far down the collar comes, as it has nothing to do with the draft or soundness of the shoulder. The farmers seem to pay more attention to the depth of the collar than the width. Get your draft at the right spot here in the shoulder no matter what is down below. He does not draw down here. There is the point of draft on this horse. You must fit the collar to the horse, and con - sider the different slopes of the shoulder. There is much difference in the slope of the shoulder, this horse is criticised for the slope of the shoulder which is too straight. II believe the breeders of all breeds concede to the Clydesdale best gait at the walk; it is largely because of the position of the . and he is more sloping in the shoulder; he has the shortest top for the length of his body, and the longest under line of any be breeds. It makes it easy for him to raise the forefeet and put n forward. If we have action in front we must have a sloping ilder. A straight shouldered horse is a horse that stumbles. You ■r saw a sloping shouldered horse that stumbles. This horse is straight. The slope should be about 45 degrees. We also criticise this horse in the length of the back, caused, in part, by the straight shoulder. Here is the mechanical principle involved. We should never have the back longer than the hind quar - ter or the depth of the shoulder. If we have the back shorter than the other two measurments we will have the nearest approach to the arch which is the strongest self-supporting principle known to the science of mechanics. We cannot get too long a hip or hind quarter. We cannot get too long a croup. The slope, or angle of the croup is not essential at all so far as the utility of the horse is con - cerned. We find the horse just as strong with a steep as a straight croup, but when you go after the other fellow's money you find that he will pay more for the straight croup, as it adds to the beauty of the horse. We should have him well muscled. We cannot get too much muscle anywhere. It takes muscle to draw a load. We will now refer to the front part. We find here quite a dif - ference in the breeds in the arm and forearm. We have in one breed what we call a bulging arm and stifle; it is muscular development, and the horses move heavy loads with greater ease than those that do not have that muscle. It is generally evidence of vitality, because we find associated with it a horse that is compactly built and having a large heart girth. We do not need to fear too much muscle either in </seg>
            <seg id="p183">182 ANNUAL REPORT The knee la essential. I would criticise this horse in not having enough knee. We find the horse that endures hard work and strain, if he is a heavy horse, is the horse that has a good wide kne« in front, and good width from the top to the bottom, and it should be well supported at the bottom. If it goes in here at an angle at the bottom of the knee we are liable to have too much weakness. Another very important essential in the front part of the horse Is the pastern. Statistics show a large number of geldings that were •old as sound upon the market afterwards go wrong in front because of defective pasterns. Here it should be of good length and elastic. In the draft breeds we seldom find too long a pastern. Out of every ten horses we find seven too short in the pastern, and it is a'so stated that eight oat of every ten are too straight. It is the short, straight pastern that gives us the sidebone, which we all object to, because of the greater concussion resulting, and want of elasticity. I believe in the past we have given too much attention to the foot and not enough to the pastern. We have found by actual tests which the Scotch have carried on. that an ordinary foot with a good pastern over it will often with good shoeing improve in quality, while the best foot in the world with a short straight pastern will soon go wrong, and by constant pounding will soon destroy any foot however good. A good foot is told very quickly. It means a high foot, broad at the heal, and high at the heel. If it is broad and high at the heel you will find a good frog that helps in carrying out the purpose of the pastern in dissa - pating concussion. A high and broad foot is an indication of the strength of the wall of the foot. If the wall of the foot to sufficient - ly strong to sustain the weight of the horse it will grow in an up - right position. If it is not strong enough it spreads and we have the big, flat, round foot which is not desirable. N,o matter how long the horse may be in body, he should be short in the back and as long as possible in the underline. If he has a sloping shoulder and a short back and a long croup i\e will be long in the underline, and as a result you have a good mover. The remark I made about the arm and forearm will apply to the hind leg. We never can get too much muscle, and we cannot get too much of a good thing. I was once told by a dealer that after I got through scoring a horse one could not sell him in the market, because of the many weak points I would mention. But the points I bring out are itial to the good horse, and you cannot get them too good. The perfect points should be your ideal; get the best hock, the best pastern, the best foot it is possible to put on a horse. The hock is the most important part of the horse, more so even than the pastern, because we find in the United States about 21 per cent of all geldings sold sound upon the market at four and five years of age, go wrong because of defective hocks. Dr. Anderson described the curby conformation. The hock that is not supported </seg>
            <seg id="p184">STALLION REGISTRATION BOARD 183 wide a hock. I never saw one, neither did you. We will never get one too wide at the true joint below the hock. The thing that per - haps most of you make a mistake in, in the selection of the hock. Is In selecting what we call a finished hock. Instead of being smooth and round and finished, if you use those terms to describe it, It should be very rough, and prominent in all its parts. The strong hock that stands by a horse for years, even though he may work ever so hard, will be found of that kind. It will be prominent in all its parts. We criticise this horse as being too smooth in the forepart of the hock. The smooth hocks are necessarily just a little bit meaty and too short on bone. But if they are smooth we will find with hard work they soon become filled. We find the filled hock is nice smooth hock. tWe concede to the Clydesdale the best hock, and you will notice the true Clydesdale hock is very nice in front because if its inence, and it is very thin behind, giving it a triangular form, rries its width on down to the fetlock. We do not need so good Kistern behind as in front. Sixty per cent of the weight of the age horse is over the front legs, and because of the extra weight pastern should be more elastic in front than behind. The pas - behind should be about 35 degrees and in front not less than legrees. I The back of this horse is straight enough, but he should be I in a little better over the coupling. If he was filled here with cle he would be better. In most of the draft horses in use they ar thick at the top. That is made possible by the extra muscular lopment which they need to move heavy loads, and if this horse muscled through here he would be better. He is deficient along back. He is too straight in the shoulder and we would criticise horse in the pastern. IGet the legs as near together in the horse as you possibly can. horse is deficient in the breast and not filled well lower down. ything he is too far apart at the ground. In Scotland they have I stem of stretching a rope for a distance of 300 feet, when they ? a horse judging contest. One horse at a time is put to the test traddling this rope, having the right legs on one side and the left the other, and if he can straddle that stretched rope without hing it he is considered a well balanced horse and of proper ormation. Of course the legs should not be spread too far apart, he should be able to walk along without touching the rope. The ter way for a horse to move is in a straight line without friction, we have very few horses able to do that. We know what is red in the horse, and we recognize these good points when we them, but we do not get enough of them. A horse that will measure 84 to 86 inches heart girth should measure two inches more in the flank girth, and if he is in the feed </seg>
            <seg id="p185">ANNUAL REPORT 184 yard he will measure more. This horse is slightly too high in his hips, and his underline is a little short. A member: How about the hame? »A wagon calls for a lower draft than a harrow. With all the iting of our greatness in America, after all has been said, we great only in our own praise. We hare never had a hame made in America that is properly made to pull a load, and the way in which they are made in this country it is a great deal of work to change our draft. In the old country they are more simple. They are far ahead of us in this matter. They can change the draft in the fraction of a second. ■ A member: What do you think of the Humane Collar? Would recommend it? tProf. Carlson: The Humane collar is good, but still it is not I it should be when it comes to the draft. On heavy horses you &gt;thimes get narrow siie, and they will chafe the horse here by g too wide. If you have the wide horse you want to get the frame. The point of draft is illustrated here. You cannot go a barn in America and find a horse that has been worked to extent that does not have scars, but all that could be avoided if had the right collar. ■ A member: What do you think of the sweat collar? Should use them? Prof. Carlson: Burn them up. A member: How do you like the steel collar? Prof. Carlson: The tubular steel collar is the best in the world. There is a tubular steel collar that very few Americans have ever reen. They are the only collar for drawing heavy loads. We do not Tiave them here. We have not become progressive enough. A farmer can use the steel collar successfully. Our Government is using a few of these in this country, and there are three cities in America where some of the heavy transfer horses are using them with success, but they are not made here. They are imported. The last time I was talking with one of those transfer companies they had to send abroad for them. ■ Our time la up and I believe that is about all I have to say at time, (applause) ■ The remainder of the afternoon was consumed in the men's students" judging contest </seg>
