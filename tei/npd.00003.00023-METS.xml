STATE LIBRARIAN 

FOll THE 

TWO YEARS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 1900

<seg id="p003">
To His Excellency, W. A. Poynter, Governor of Nebraska: 
I herewith respectfully submit the biennial report of the 

condition of the State Library for the period commencing 
December 1, 1898, and ending November 30, 1900. 

Lee Heedman, 

State Librarian. 

December 1, 1900. </seg>


            <seg id="p005">
REPORT. 

The number of volumes in the State Library, November 30, 

1900, together with the number of accessions for the last 

biennial period, will appear from the following table 

BOUND

Number of volumes, November 

Total, November 30, 1900. .39,439 3,965 43,404 

The appendix to this report contains a list of the accessions 
to the library alphabetically arranged. In making additions 
to the library by purchase, no departure has been made from 
the methods adopted by my predecessor and outlined in his 
several reports. 

Allow me to call attention to the several recommendations 
made by D. A. Campbell, the librarian immediately preceding 
me, in his last report. 

The room in the capitol building occupied as a library is 
not of sufficient capacity for the purpose. The local bar of 
the capitol city and the bar of the state make use of the 
library room constantly. It is proper that they should. 
About one hundred forty students from the law department 
of the university likewise make continuous use of the room. 
This is also proper. But it is next to impossible to accommodate 
so many in the available space and with the number 
of tables now furnished. When we take into account the

official rights of the supreme and nisi prius judges and of the 
executive departments of the state and members of the legislature, 
the rights of citizens and academic students, with 
courtesies due visitors, when we consider the increasing demands 
commensurate with the growth of the state and its 
institutions, this demand for more space seems an imperative 
one which it is siucerely trusted will not be overlooked. Such 
!emand is made doubly strong from the fact that more books 
re being added to the library. This happens in the ordinary 
jurse of events. Forty-five states and four territories issue 
jports, most of them annually or semi-annually. The Nationl 
Reporter system has nine sets of reports, to which new volmes 
are being constantly added. The new volumes of Canadian 
and English reports and the new editions of standard 
legal text-books need only to be mentioned. The popular and 
stereotyped expression "up to date" applies to a law library 
with as mucn emphasis as to anything modern. 

The shelf room is already crowded. If the traveling library 
system, so ably and justly recommended by Mr. Campbell, 
were adopted, it would hardly furnish the necessary 
relief from over-crowded shelves, as most miscellaneous books 
now in the library could hardly be spared for that purpose. 
The specific remedy for these t\fin evils of small space and 
overcrowded shelves will be for determination by the bodies 
charged with that duty. 

The appropriation for the purpose of new books should be 
liberal. To the current wants is added the fact that many 
books in the library ought to be duplicated, triplicated, or 
multiplied. One copy can hardly satisfy the contemporaneous 
want of a supreme judge, a district judge, a lawyer, and 
a class of law students. There is, too, a paucity of works 
in the library on international law and political economy. 

The force provided for the library work is insufficient, </seg>

Court reports have appeared, and volume 59 and a portion 

of 60 are in type.
