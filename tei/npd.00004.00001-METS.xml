Poynter, Governor and Cornmaiider-in-Chief, Lincoln, Neb.: vSir — I have the honor to submit the following report of the work in this department for the biennial period from November 30, 1898 to December 31, 1900. t Since my last report all the Nebraska Volunteer organ - ions of the Spanish-American War have been mustered of the United States service. The Second Regiment &gt;raska Volunteer Infantry mustered out at Omaha, Octo - 24, 1898, of which you are fully informed in my last E&gt;rt, covering the years of 1897 and 1898. Since that od the Third Nebraska Volunteer Infantry was ordered luba, leaving the United States at the close of the year 3. The regiment performed well all duties assigned to hile in the Army of Occupation, and participated in the Memorial Services held at the graves of the Sailors and trines, who perished with the Battle Ship Maine, on Feb - ry 15, 1898. After the Island was pacified the regiment ; ordered to the United States for muster-out; leaving i&gt;a April 7, and arriving at Augusta, Georgia, April and were there mustered out of the United States </seg>

Bryan, late of the Third Nebraska Volunteer Infantry, a Committe of Citizens, friends and relatives of the members of the regiment, to welcome these gallant men back to their home State. The first section arrived at n p. in. and the last two sections at 2:30 a. m. I made provision for the care and comfort of the sick, placing those in need of hospital care in the hospitals of Omaha. I am pleased to state, however, that a very small percentage of sickness prevailed among the members of this command. RETURNING OF THE KIRST NEBRASKA. ()n Juae [6, [899, information was received at this office that the First Nebraska Volunteer Infantry was re - lieved from the firing line and ordered to take transports for the United States. On July 1, Colonel Mulford wired this office of the departure of the regiment on the transport Han - cock for the United States, stopping at Nagasaki, Japan, where the men were given shore leave. On July 15 the regiment left Japan fur San Francisco, arriving in San Francisco Bay July 30. By direction of Your Excellency and in accordance with General Orders, No. 17, A. (i. ()., Lincoln, Nebraska, July 20, 1899, I proceeded to San Francisco, accompanied by Colonel W. L. Stark, Member of Congress from the Fourth District, to make necessary arrangements for the care of the members of this command, keeping in mind your special instruction regarding the sick and wounded. I arrived at San Francisco on July 23 and was met at the hotel in the morning by Captain Green, Aid-de-Camp of (ieneral £ iied the compliment- of the </seg>

I immediately proceeded to the General Hospital at the Presidio where I found a number of sick and wounded men of the First Nebraska; most of them suffering severely from change of climate, from the tropics to that of the cold damp atmosphere of San Fran - cisco. I personally met every soldier of the First Nebraska and talked with each and every man regarding his ailment, condition and needs, when I presented them to the executive officers of the hospital and the same were supplied with - out hesitation. By your direction and with the advice of Major Snyder, Surgeon of the First Nebraska, chest pro - tectors wvre purchased for the entire regiment. Arrange - ments were made through General Shafter to provide heavy ■woolen clothing for the men immediately upon their arrival at camp, upon requisition being made for same. Through the courtesy of General Shafter, I was invited to visit the camp of the First Nebraska at the Presidio and make any arrangements deemed necessary. In company with &lt;ieneral Shafter's Aid-de-Camp I personally visited the camp and found all that could be desired to make the camp a healthy and pleasant one. On the following day another transport arrived with a number of members of the First Nebraska, wounded and suffering from disease. These men were cared for in the same manner as the ones arriving on July 24, above men - tioned. On July 30, after retiring, telephone message was re - ceived from the Harbor Master that the transport Hancock was sighted off the Farallone Islands. Immediately, with Your Excellency and Colonel Stark, I proceeded to the tug </seg>

Taylor of the First Nebraska, we proceeded to the Bay where the Hancock lay at anchor. On arriving along side of the Hancock our tug was hailed by the guard. Upon being informed that the Governor of Nebraska was on board and desired to welcome the officers and men back to their native land, I need not recall to your mind how quickly the rails of the transport were lined with men, and the cordial greeting given you by Colonel Mulford, commander of this splendid regiment. On the following dav the transport was docked at the government dock, but the Colonel of the ment deemed it not wise to depart from the transport for camp until Monday morning. At 8 o'clock Monday morning the regiment formed upon the dock, with the proper military escort, and marched through the city of San Francisco to the Presidio, where it was welcomed by Your Excellency. Your address of welcome was responded to by Colonel Mulford by calling for three cheers for the Governor of Nebraska, which were given with a will and followed by a tiger. The regiment remained in camp at the Presidio until August 23, the date of muster-out of the United State - vice; and were returned to the State without any expev the members of the regiment, by reason of your appeal to the citizens calling for, donations to a fund for re - turning the First Nebraska to their homes. By your order I again proceeded to San Francisco to make necessary trans - portation arrangements, and to care for the sicR and wounded in transit; all of which was performed in compliance with your order.

After .the muster-out of the Second Nebraska Volunteer Infantry the work of re-organization was commenced. The policy suggested by me and concurred in by your prede - cessor, Governor Holcomb, was approved by you, of organ - izing the companies of the Second Regiment in the towns where these companies were located prior to the muster into the United States service. This policy has borne good re - sults in securing the services of veterans who had seen serv - ice in the Spanish-American War. The Second Regiment and Troop "A" of the Nebraska National Guard were com - pletely organized on the 6th day of June, 1899. Upon the muster-out of the First Nebraska Volunteer Infantry the labor of re-organization was commenced, and this grand regiment, with a history running back to the Civil War, completely re-organized, and all companies mustered into service and all field officers chosen, on the nth day of June, 1900. son-Commissioned Staff -lospital Corps Ottir.-r- : Total s umber not reported for transportation 43 s Total number of officers and men trans- ported - </seg>

Cav - alry, I am pleased to report, have been returned to the State. The Ordnance stores returned are in good order, in fact as good as those transferred to the troops on entering the United States service. The Quartermaster stores re - ceived are all in good order, but of an inferior quality, the clothing being coarse and of a poorer grade, the tentage be - ing that used in the Spanish-American War, not in as good order and the quality not as good as the properly trans - ferred. EQUIPMENT OK THK NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD. The Nebraska National Guard is equipped in a better manner than ever before. The men are armed with Spring - field rifles, caliber 45, woven cartridge belts with plates, bayonets and scabbards with hook attachment, haversacks, canteens, knives, forks, spoons, tin cups and an abundance of ammunition. The troop is armed in the same manner as when in the United States service. Battery "A" has the same old obsolete arms, viz., 33-inch Rodman muzzle - loading rifles and the necessary equipment. The enlisted men are furnished with the undress uniform of the United States army, consisting of fatigue caps, blouses, tror. leggings, dark-blue flannel shirts, campaign hats, berlin gloves and the necessary tentage to supply all the wants oi the Guard. The messing facilities for the entire Guard are very good by reason of the purchase of Huzzacott ovens and Huntsfield ranges, both doing good work and giving ex - cellent satisfaction. </seg>

The experience of the commissioned officers in the Spanish-American War ha? taught them the wisdom of keeping proper records of the property accountability. It is a matter of mutual interest to the State and the officers concerned that these statements be made promptly, and I desire to impress upon the officers the importance of render - ing their accounts of property received from the State matter of instruction as well as duty) promptly, which will enable this office to keep up its records.

In this connection I desire to return thanks to O W. L.

The greatest drawback seems to be in the uring of a suitable target range. I had obtained, early the season, permission to use the target range at Fort x&gt;k, but the permission was later withdrawn by reason of : complaints of the citizens in and about Fort Crook on rount of the projectiles falling beyond the range. I sin - ely hope that during the coming season this important inch of the military service will be taken up and carried : more successfully. ENCAMPMENTS. I During the biennial just closing, the Nebraska National lard in 1899 camped in Lincoln Park under command of lonel A. E. Campbell of the Second Infantry. The camp instruction was thorough and your attention is invited to ! report of the Camp Commander, which is made a part this report. For the year 1900 the Nebraska National arc! went into camp of instructions at Hastings, and in npliance with paragraph four of General Orders No. 24, ssumed command of the camp. As Brigade Commander • report is appended, and your attention is respectfully ited to the same. In both of these camps practical in - uctions were given in field work. The troops were issued the regulation army ration allowance with the addition of milk, butter and eggs. The A the ration allowance per man was a trifle less than 20 cents per diem, making a saving to the State of $991.20 over the system in vogue at other encampments. All companies were supplied with field cooking outfits, thus </seg>

The general satisfaction given in conforming to field customs. in the matter of subsistence was most satisfactory to the offi - cers and men, and made the camp what the law contem - plated, purely a camp of instruction. FLAG C\SE FOR FLAGS OK THE CIVIL AND SPANISH-AMERI- CAN WARS. I The Twenty-sixth Session of the Nebraska Legislature &gt;ropriated $1,000.00 to erect a flag case and to provide a -proof door for the vault in the Adjutant General's office. :h of these were much needed, as the flags of the Civil r were going rapidly to decay by reason of old age and lospheric influences. The case erected in this office now itains the flags of the Nebraska Regiments in the Civil r and the flags of the First, Second and Third Regiments the Nebraska Volunteers and Troop "K" of the Third ited States Cavalry in the Spanish-American War. ere are also a number of trophies and relics that are of y great historic value and will be highly prized for all NATIONAL APPROPRIATIONS The General Government appropriated in 1899 $400, - 000.00 for arming and equipping the malitia of the United States. The organized malitia consists of one hundred and fifteen thousand officers and men. This appropriation was divided among the States according to their representation in Congress, PROVIDED that each state maintain a reasonable force of organized malitia, not less than one hundred men for each representative in Congress. Nebraska's share in this appropriation was $6,900.90. The present session of Congress made an appropriation of one million dollars </seg>

            <seg id="p023">ADIDTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. 23 1 wish to again renew my recommendation made in my prior report in the matter of armory rent. By resolution of the Military Board $100 per annum has been allowed each company, troop and battery for headquarters, and I wish to state that this allowance was as large as the appropriation made would warrant, and I submit that $8.33 per month will not provide suitable armory in any city or town in the State. The companies have stored in their armories military prop - erty consisting of arms, clothing, tentage and other military equipment valued at $2,000, and it would seem to me that $200 per annum would be a very conservative sum, and I would recommend that the legislature make this annual allowance, separate and distinct for the armory rent of the Nebraska National Guard. OFFICERS' SCHOOL OF INSTRUCTION I wish to again repeat my recommendation for the necessity of an officers' school of instruction. While the National Guard of the State are very efficient in the per - formance of their duty, yet it is necessary for the commis - sioned officers to constantly keep up the study and much more can be accomplished in an annual school of theoretical instruction lor the commissioned officers of the Guard. This school could be held at any point designated 1&gt;'. and would result in giving the Guard a better corps of offi - cers, and I wish to repeat again that the only weakm the National Guard is in the personnel of the commissioned officers. The enlisted men are of the best young men in the State, and with each company commanded by efficient officers who are thoroughly instructed in the care of their K EC&lt; &gt;M M KNDATIONS. </seg>

CHANGES RECOMMENDED IN MILITARY CODE. 1 would recommend an entire change in the Military Code of the State conforming to act of Congress re-organiz - ing the Army of the United States. This would permit the nization of the Nebraska National Guard along modem and allow the organization of an Engineer's Corps. Signal Corps and Hospital Corps, which the present law not permit. The necessity for an Engineer, Signal and Hospital Corps is too obvious to need your attention further. And especially as to the need of a well equipped Hospital Corps; I need only point to the suffering during the Spanish-American War, and if the medical department had been provided with trained Hospital Corps, a great deal of this suffering might have been avoided. RE-EQUIPMENT OF THE BATTERY. I would earnestly recommend that the Hatter}- be equipped with modern breech-loading guns for the same :is that are advanced to supply the modern soldier with modern and up-to-date weapons to meet an armed foe on equal footing. The Battery stationed at Wymore ha~ a splendid organization and has kept in existence under very trying circumstances, and it is but justice to the National Guard of the State that this organization should ' i rough t up to the same perfection in equipment as artillery in the United States Army, and this can be done out of the increased allowance allowed by the United </seg>
            <seg id="p025">25 Mo»t of the States having troops participating in the battle of Shiloh, April 6th and 7th, 1862, have erected monu - ments giving the positions their respective regiments occu - pied from time to time during the engagement. The First Nebraska did its full duty in this, one of the fiercest battles of the Civil War. Its officers and men are now becoming enfeebled by age, and if Nebraska desires to have the bene - fit of their experience in locating the monument and mark - ing the positions of this noble regiment it must be done im - mediatelv. I would therefore recommend that the sum of fiive thousand 15,000' dollars l&gt;e appropriated for the erec - tion of a suitable monument and tablets marking the position of the Hirst Nebraska in the battle of Shiloh. RECOMMENDATION FOR ENCAMPMENT. I would most respectfully recommend that in all future encampments that the matter of squad and company drill be dispensed witlr for the reason that all time in camp should be employed in regimental and battalion drill. The companies at their home stations have no oppor - tunity to participate in the above-named drills. I would also recommend that in the future field target practice be given under the supervision of instructors of rifle practice in the various organizations. The medical department is not supplied as completely as it should be for the want of funds. At present the medi - cal department is supplied with medical chests, hospital tentage and a small amount of hospital supplies.

SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR MEDALS. The Twenty-sixth Session of the Nebraska Legislature passed a joint resolution authorizing the Governor of Ne - braska to provide for the presentation to the officers and men of the First, Second and Third Regiments of the Nebraska Volunteer Infantry and Troop "K," Third U. S. Volunteer Cavalry, in the Spanish- American War, but failed to make the necessary appropriation to carry the resolution into effect. I would recommend to Your Excellency that the sum of $4,100.00 be appropriated to carry this act into effect. Suitable medals for this purpose can be provided for this sum, and the same will be highly prized by the vol - unteer soldiers of the State. By reason of the manifold duties of the Adjutant Gen - eral of this State, who not only performs the duties of Adju - tant General, Quartermaster, Commissary General and often times performs the duties of Paymaster General, thereby absorbing more time from the duties of his office than he should be called upon to give. In addition to the dut the above-named officies, he has to compile, file and collect the claims of the State against the United States &lt; iovern - ment incurred by the Governor of the State in the lati with Spain. I would therefore invite your attention to the need of increased clerical help in this office. During the past year I have been obliged to obtain at various times temporary cleri - cal help, and as yet have been, unable to finish up tin amount of work that has accumulated in this office during </seg>

CONCLUSION. In conclusion I desire to state that my very best efforts have been made to place the Guard of the State upon a practical and efficient basis. Constant effort is necc and constant labor is required to maintain the Guard at its present high standing. It niust be kept in mind at all times that the National Guard is composed of citizer diers ; the ranks are filled up with men who devote con - siderable time and money and a large amount of patient labor for the purpose of establishing and maintain: well-trained corps of citizen soldiery. They take up this work through patriotic motives. They necessarily have many other obligations and duties. The fact that the National Guard of the State have distinguished themselves in the volunteer service of the United States by reason of their efficiency as State Ti is just cause why the State should be more liberal in the support ot its citizen soldiery. I desire to express to the officers and men of the Na - tional Guard of this State my thanks for their kind treat - ment. Since I assumed the duties of administering the affairs o this office, Apiil 17, 1895, they have a! treated me with the utmost courtesy, kindness and consider - ation. And I desire especially to thank the officers and men of the First, Second and Third Regiments of the Nebraska Volunteer Infantry and Troop " K. " of the Third </seg>

The camp was located in Lincoln Park on the site of the encampment of 1896. The space occupied was re - stricted, but sufficient for a camp of regulation formation, with restricted distances, the company streets being twenty - five feet in width and the battalion intervals forty feet. The quarter stretch of the race course afforded a good drill ground. The weather during the entire period of the camp was ideal for military purposes, although the men were rendered somewhat uncomfortable by the low temperature in the early mornings The regimental headquarters was established at Camp Stotsenburg on September 8th, one day previous to the ar - rival of the companies, and, as provided in General Orders j 1 , from Adjutant General's office, August 16th, 1899, the company quartermaster-sergeants and the cooks re - (1 to the Camp Commander on that day.

            <seg id="p049">ADJITANT GENERAL'S REPORT. 49 The Brigade went into camp west of Hastings, at the Fair Grounds, on a plat of ground of ample size, sloping gently to the west. A number of water barrels were laid at the foot of each company street, filled with ice water, afford - ing constantly an abundance of good water for the men. A water barrel for each cooking tent for cooking purposes was also provided. Previous to the arrival of the troops the camp was laid out and the grounds staked off under my direction, by the yuartennaster of the Second Regiment — the Brigade camp in Company columns at full distance, with the Cavalry and Artillery in the rear of the General Headquarters. The reg - iments were divided into battalions of four companies each, and were assigned to places according to rank. The battal - ions were commanded by the Lieutenant-Colonels and Ma - jors of each regiment, respectively. The Second Regiment was on the right of the column and the bands on the right of their respective regiments. Line, Field and General officers were encamped in their proper positions as provided in reg - ulations. I In the rear of the company streets were located the ;s tents, and in the rear of the mess tents was the field king outfits and kitchens, and beyond the kitchens were sinks and laterenes, where the refuse was dumped daily covered by the police detail at the proper call. The iment was supplied with Hunt's field ranges, which e perfect satisfaction. The Second Regiment was sap - id witli Buzzacott cooking outfits. The field cooking tits were a vast improvement over the many ingenious trivances employed by the Nebraska National Guard at ner encampments. These field cooking outfits enabled 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 ADJTTANT GENKRAL'S REPORT. the cooks to prepare the food issued to them expeditiously. and to serve it in a much better manner. The Commissary Department was in charge of Lieuten - ant (iascoinge, Quartermaster of the Second Regiment, and was well administered. The rations were issued promptly and the department met all the demands upon it. Of the Quartermaster's Department in charge of Lieutenant John k. Quein, 1 cannot speak too highly. His administration while in camp was most satisfactory. However, in the return of the Quartermaster stores and Ordnance to the Adjutant General's office in Lincoln, by some oversight, the same was not properly invoiced and bills of lading were not properly made out in shipping the same to the Quartermaster General at Lincoln. The camp was a most successful one. The officers and men came to camp with a spirit to acquire as much knowl - edge as was possible in the six days prescribed in the en - campment order. The transportation services were splen - did. The first company arrived at the grounds at 7 a. m. and the last company at 5 p. m. To secure this prompt moblization it was necessary to arrange for special trains for portions of the command. The camp was laid out with company, battalion and regimental parade. The grounds had sufficient slope to enable the battalion, regimental and brigade commanders to overlook their respective commands. The camp was designated "Camp Lee Forby" in honor of Captain Lee Forby, Company "('..".First Regiment Nebraska Volunteer Infantry, who was killed in action March 28, 1899, at the battle of Marilao, Philippine Islands. The dutv calls, as announced in Field Orders No. 1, </seg>
            <seg id="p051">ADJUTANT r.EXF.RAL'S REPORT. 51 were followed as closely as possible. On the first day of the encampment, at the usual hour, both regiments held parade, which was very creditable considering the great distance many of the companies had traveled and the wearied condi - tion of the troops generally. On Tuesday morning, the 2tst 'mat., the regular pro - gram of exercises was carried out as prescribed in Field Orders Xo. i. In making the rounds of the camp I was pleased to note the splendid care given the sick, and the effective work of instructions in the Hospital Corps. Four men were detailed as litter bearers from each company, and under the able instructions given by Captain Mullins of the First Regiment, under the supervision of Surgeon General Barns, these men tnade most excellent progress in the litter bearers' drill. At the close of the parade the troops passed in review before the Brigade General and acquitted themselves most creditablv. On Wednesday, the 22nd inst., Field Orders No. 1 was modified by Field Orders No. 6, which permitted the troop and battery to have full possession of the parade grounds in the morning for cavalry drill. It was most interesting to see the cavalry under command of Captain Kinney, and also the excellent work did by the artillery in conjunction with the cavalry. This drill made these two branches of the service more popular with the other members of the Guard. I am pleased to commend to Your Excellency the splen - did work in the medical department in charge of Surgeon General Barns, and in particular the first aid to the wounded. In the Hospital Corps one hundred men trained in the litter bearer drill. The drill work was such </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 Arji|TTpAT^*p ( ' K \ F R M * dl* T*f~\ D T as lifting the wounded and carrying them to the hospitaf and again removing them from the litter. This was all done in accordance with the manual published by Surgeon (General Barns. tOn Thursday, the 23rd inst., the usual order of exer - were carried out. The day was hot and oppressive, the burning dust made it most disagreeable for the ■rs and men. In the evening the Brigade Commander, accompanied by Colonel Hayward, Colonel Killian, Captain Murdock of Battery "A," and Captain Kinney of Troop "A," went to tlu- Burlington depot to meet Your Excellency upon your ar - rival in the city and to welcome you to Camp Lee Forby. After being informed that other arrangements had l&gt;eeu made, myself and the above-named officers returned to camp just in time to witness tha^nost severe wind and rain storm that has visited this sectioifof the State. Many of the tents were blown down. It was most gratifying to note the cheerful disposition of the officers and men, under these trying conditions, and watch them making the rounds of the camp, giving instructions in caring for the tentage and otherwise remedying the havoc done by the storm. Before the storm ceased I issued orders to the several Commanding Officers, directing them to have their cooks make an abun - dance of hot coffee and give the men a lunch and all the hot coffee they cared to drink. This had a marked effect in re - moving the depressing effects of the storm, and it accom - plished good results, for the next morning every man was ready for duty at the usual calls. On Thursday, the 24th inst., the Brigade carried out the usual morning exercises. After dinner it was deemed by me, after consulting with the Commanding &lt; officers, </seg>
            <seg id="p053">53 to receive Your Excellency in the city, escorting you to camp by giving the officers and men a practice march, teaching the officers to care for their men while on impor - t.nit duty of this nature. The splendid condition in which the men arrived in camp speaks volumes of praise for the judgment of the Commanding Officers of the various organi - zations. tin the evening the regular regimental parade was held the entire Brigade passed in review before Your Excel - y. I was proud of the many compliments bestowed n the officers and men of my command. Officers' Call I had the pleasure of presenting Your ellency to the officers of the Brigade. The few kind re - ks made by Your Excellency on this occasion made a last - impression upon all the officers present. I On this evening, as on all evenings, the officers and were entertained in camp by concerts alternately by the t and Second Regiment bands. During the concert I was notified by telephone message that some of the enlisted men were rioting in the city. I immediately detailed Major McDonnell of the Second Regi - ment to take all necessary measures to quiet the disturbance and report to me from time to time all movements of his command. Major McDonnell's report is attached, and I de - sire to compliment him as Commanding Officer, Captain John C. Hartigan of Second Regiment, Captain William S. Kin - if Troop "A," Lieutenant Robert D. Clapp, Officer of the Day ; Lieutenant Carl H. I'ilger, Officer of the Guard, and the enlisted men composing the patrol guard. The officers did their duty most creditably and returned to camp at midnight. IOn Saturday, the 25th inst., the usual morning pro - m was carried out. </seg>

At Litter Bearers' Drill I issued orders to the Surgeon General that each company should receive one hospital pouch. Each pouch to contain (our (4 ) manuals, rolls of gauze, antiseptic bandages, tourniquet, surgeon's knife, scissors, first aid appliances, wire splints and other necessi - ties for emergencies. Instructions were that each company should take these pouches to their home stations and have the same on haud in all emergencies. The drill for the prize of the Governor's Challenge Cup took place at 9:30 a. m. in charge of Colonel Kilian of the First Infantry, Companies "F" and "G" of the Second In - fantry competing. The competitors were required to com - ply with all conditions of Field Orders No. 9. The judges were Colonel Kilian, Lieutenant-Colonel Harry L. Archer and Major William K. Moore. The decision was unanimous in awarding the prize to Company "G." I At 11 o'clock a. m. the "General" was sounded and the last note of the trumpet all tentagt except Brigade adquarters and Company '"B," Second Regiment, was vered. The various commands moved off the grounds compliance with Field Orders No. 10, and at 3 o'clock m. all the Ordnance and Quartermaster's stores were ided on drays and moved off the ground, when Captain tn F.

I. The 2nd Regiment, Nebraska National Guard, t assembled at Camp Lee Forby, Hastings, Nebraska, ust 20th, 1900, in compliance with General Orders, No. from Adjutant General's office, August 1st, 1900, as ified by General Orders, No. 27, from Adjutant General's e, August 10th, 1900, for instruction. All the companies of the 2nd Regiment, with the exception of Company "B," of Ord, Nebraska, reported at Camp Lee Forby during August 20th, 1900. Said Company "B," by telegraphic instructions of Brigadier General P. H. Barry, ordered to remain at its home station. ill. Camp Lee Forby was under command of Briga- General P. H. Barry. I III. Commencing at 5:30, on August 20th, 1900, the Regiment took up the regular routine of duty as cribed in Field Orders, No. 1, Brigade Headquarters, ip Lee Forby, August 20th, 1900, and continued the same 1 slight variations until August 25th, 1900, at which : Company Commanders were ordered to return with their mands to their respective home stations per Field ers, No. 10, Brigade Headquarters, Camp Lee Forby, just 24th, 1900.

The work of the officers and men during the week was excellent. The duty calls were responded to promptly. The discipline was very good, and all the officers and men showed the utmost desire to accomplish all the good possi- ble. The parades held each evening were of an unusually high order. The work taken up included squad, company, battalion and regimental drills, in close and extended order. The various companies were instructed in Guard Duty, Minor Tactics, Administration and the essentials of Military Field Engineering as regards the sanitation and drainage of a V. The health of the regiment was excellent. Dur- ing the week the sick report in 2nd Regiment was as follows: August 20th, in quarters and in hospital 1 " 2ISt, " " " 2 " 22nd, " " " ,2 22nd, " " " ,2 11 23rd, " " " I 11 24th, " " " 6 " 25th, " " " 6 There was no sickness of a serious nature, which, con- sidering the unusual hot weather and the severity of the drills, shows remarkable endurance on the part of the men. VI. The 2nd Regiment had for duty officers and men as follows: August 20th, 1900 471 " 21st, 1900 471 " 22nd, 1900 466 " 23rd, 1900 466 " 24th, 1900 467 * * f Vl » f\ 4 </seg>

This I consider a very high percentage, consider - ing the uncertainty of full pay and the short notice upon which the companies were assembled. fVII. In my opinion, Camp Lee Forby accomplished a t deal of good along all lines for the regiment. The ciation of officers and men who were not in the United es service, with those who were, was of great benefit to regiment as a whole. I VIII. I desire to make the following recommendations future encampments: tA. I would especially urge that each regiment be en - ped separately . I This I deem best for the reason that it is impossible in brigade encampments to have that unity of action neces - for the best discipline; it is more difficult to identify ain men guilty of disrespect to visitors, and of other dis - :rly conduct. An unhealthy rivalry, very apt to termi - : in jealousy and bitter feeling, may develop in a brigade impinent between the officers and men of the different meats. It is practically impossible to obtain a place ;e enough and in other ways desirable for a brigade en - ipment. iB. I would recommend that the encampment be of at t ten days' duration. tC. I would recommend that, as far as possible, Com- Commanders be given full control over, and be made mally responsible for, the conduct of their men. ID. I would recommend that at least two days of the :ampment be devoted to field movements, battalion for - tions and practice marches. </seg>

Hereto attached I transmit a special report of the occurrences of the night of August 24th, 1900, and of the competitive drill for the Governor's Cup on August 25th, 1900. Very respectfully yours, (Signed Wm. Hayward, Colonel Commanding 2nd Regiment, Nebraska National Guard. A REPORT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 24, I9OO. On the evening of August 20, about 9 o'clock, word was received at Camp Lee Forby that a row was in progress in the City of Hastings, growing out of an injury received by a soldier. Thereupon, acting under direct orders of the Commanding Officer of the camp, Brigadier General P. H. Barry, I organized a provost guard, composed of about one hundred men of the 2nd Regiment and Troop "A," and dis - patched same to Hastings under command of Major John McDonnell, following shortly after myself. Arriving in Hastings a few minutes after the provost guard, I found Major McDonnell in charge of a wrecked saloon, known as the "Brunswick," and the street filled with a very large crowd of soldiers and citizens. At that time I heard num - erous threats of another attack on the saloon and personal violence to the proprietor thereof, who, however, could not be found. I at once directed the provost guard to order all men to return to camp and to arrest all soldiers found in Hastings after 10:30 o'clock. </seg>
            <seg id="p108">106 ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. Seeing the mob well under control, and aside from threats above mentioned, no signs of drunkenness or dis - order among the soldiers, I returned to camp about 10:45, leaving Major McDonnell of the 2nd Regiment in command in Hastings, whose careful and prompt execution of the or - ders given him, assisted by Captain Hartigan, is deserving of the greatest praise. 1 After 10:30 numerous arrests were made in Hastings, there was no further disorder. Of the occurrences which took place after my return to camp, Brigadier General P. H. Barry, the commander of the camp, is fully cognizant. Very respectfully yours, 1 Signed) Wm. Hayward, Col. Commanding 2nd Regiment, Nebraska National Guard. SPECIAL REPORT OF THE COMPETITIVE DRILL FOR GOV- In compliance with Field Orders No. 9, Brigade Head- Eters, Camp Lee Forby, Aug. 23rd, 1900, Companies "F" 'G" of the 2nd Regiment entered as competitors. There no other entries. The drill was held on the morning of Aug. 25th, 1900, Company "G" being declared the winner of the contest by the judges, Colonel Kilian, Lt.-Col. Archer, and Major Moore, all of the 1st Regiment. The exhibition of these two companies disclosed a very high degree of efficiency, whose example it is hoped will be emulated by the other companies of the regiment.

Bolshaw for the conduct and excellence of their commands during the entire tour of duty at Camp Lee Forby and for the amicable relations existing between the two companies. Very respectfully yours, (Signed) Wm. Hayward, Col. Commanding 2nd Regiment, Nebraska National Guard. Headquarters First Regiment, Nebraska National Guard. Columbus, Neb., November 15, 1900. Adjutant General P. H. Barry, Lincoln, Neb.: Sir — I have the honor to herewith submit the follow - ing report of the encampment of the Nebraska National Guard at Hastings, Neb., from August 20th to 25th, in - clusive: The 1st Regiment came into camp on schedule time, except the 3rd battalion, which had been delayed by the U. P. R. R., but at 6 o'clock every company was on the grounds and ready to take up the work mapped out. The different companies presented a very good, soldierly and military appearance; they were a splendid body of men and mostly officered by men who saw service in the Philippines, and with the exception of one company ("G," of Geneva), had the requisite quota of men. During the first night there was quite a little disturb - ance after "Taps" and silence did not reign supreme until after midnight. At Reveille "setting up exercises" were had in most of the companies; squad and company drill were taken up with great vigor, and the officers and men seemed to be putting forth their very best efforts. Battalion </seg>
            <seg id="p110">108 and regimental drill were very good exhibitions of skill and energy. The review was very fine and could not be better under the circumstances. On the second day a proficiency was manifest and an eagerness on the part of the men to excel. Some compa - nies seemed to be much more proficient than the others, and an order to exchange Company Commanders seemed to bear good fruit and had excellent results in consequence of this exchange. The battalion, regimental drills and the review were the best ever had in the National Guard, as far as my experience is concerned. All officers and men in the regi - ment seemed to put their very best efforts forward to exceed anything heretofore seen. Discipline was perfect, every command being executed with a veteran-like precision; no confusion nor misunderstanding, nor hesitancy on the part of any one. The officers and men on the evening of this day were confined to camp by order of the Commanding General, and as it is not my province to pass judgment on the wisdom of such an order, still I wish to state that I was in no wise consulted regarding the matter, and as far as matters came under my observation, the men's behavior was excellent and no breach of decorum or case of misconduct occurred in the regiment. On Thursday the drill and maneuvers were as good as on the previous day, and the same can be said of Friday, the 24th. The extended order drill of the regiment was as good any the old "First" ever had on the field after being in the U. S. Volunteer service for over a year, and this can only be accounted for by the fact that the officers and non-commissioned officers were experienced men, and that the material was in the main the best ever secured for the Guard. </seg>
            <seg id="p111">ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. 109 I have nothing but praise for the regiment, but I be - lieve that it would be better for the service and more con - ducive to good discipline to have separate encampments for the two regiments and have a rifle range. A modern sol - dier must be able to shoot straight and hit the mark, and my aim to build up a fighting regiment would be to have good marksmen, armed with the best rifle, and I would therefore suggest that more stress should be laid on "rifle practice," and that each company should practice firing every day during the encampment, doing away with squad and company drill, of which they generally have enough at home, and have rifle practice and battalion and regimental drills and inarches, advance and rear guard, outpost and field duty only. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, (Signed) J. N. Kiliax, Colonel Commanding. Chas. M. Richards, ist Lieut, and Adjutant. Headquarters Battery "A," Light Artillery, Nebraska National Guard. Wymoke, Nkb., September 4, 1900. P. H. Barry, Adjutant General, Lincoln, Neb.: Dear Sir — In accordance with your request, I respect- fully submit the following report: In compliance with General Order No. 24, A. G. O., Lincoln, Neb., August ist, 1900, the officers and members of Battery "A," Nebraska National Guard, were ordered to assemble at the armory iuWymoreon Sunday, August 19th, 1900, at 1 p. m., with the necessary clothing and bedding </seg>
            <seg id="p112">110 preparatory to going into Camp of Instruction of the Ne - braska National Guard at Hastings, Nebraska, on the 20th day of August, 1900, and remaining in camp at said place until the evening of the 25th day of August, 1900. The members of the Battery assembled as ordered, the guns, caissons and limbers, harness, saddles, tents and all Battery equipments were moved to the B. &amp; M. depot at Wymore and loaded on cars preparatory to starting for Hastings at 5:50 next morning. The horses secured for use by the Bat - tery were brought in, picket ropes stretched and horses fast - ened thereto, fed hay and grain. Guards were detailed and placed on duty to guard the guns, caissons, equipments and horses during the night. The men slept in the cars. August 20th Reveille was sounded at 3:30 a. m. Horses fed, breakfast prepared for the men, horses watered and loaded in cars, mess chests and camping utensils placed in the car, and at about 6 a. m. we left Wymore, on the freight train, with five officers and 26 enlisted men. At Beatrice cars were attached to our train for Company "C," 1st Regiment, and Band, 2nd Regiment. At Wilber a car was attached for Company "E," 1st Regiment. We then ran to Crete, where our cars were attached to a special train from Lincoln and other points, and moved out for Hastings, Nebraska, where we arrived at 12:35 p. m. II wish to state here that officers of the Infantry had irds stationed at the car doors and would not allow their n to pass out without permission. This seemed unneces - y to me. I have had the honor of commanding Battery .," Nebraska National Guard, for the past 22 years, and ring that time I have never placed a guard at a car door : a chain guard against a camp. If a man abuses his vilege and disobeys an order he individually is restricted punished and not the entire command. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">111 After our cars were placed on a side-track at Hastings I had the horses, guns, caissons, limbers and harness un - loaded, the horses harnessed and hitched to guns and cais - sons, had tents and Battery equipments loaded on a dray and moved out to Camp Lee Forby, and reported to the Commanding Officer and was assigned location for Battery, on which we parked guns, put up picket rope, had horses unharnessed and fed, and the men marched to mess tent for dinner. After dinner had company tents put up, camp policed and harness and guard tents put up, and all nicely located before time to fire the sunset gun at Retreat and all in readiness to comply fully with the rules and regulations as designated by Field Order No. i. August 21st, roll call at Reveille. All officers and men present and ready for duty. Had dismounted and mounted drill, forenoon and afternoon, and put in full time in order to get the horses broke in, as several of them had never had an artillery harness on, or been used on guns or caissons before they came to the camp. By kind and gentle treat - ment we had them working very nicely by evening, really better than could be expected, for at 6:35 p. m. we formed on the left of the infantry at very close interval, for parade and review, which is an unusual thing for a battery to do with raw, green horses on the first day they have been used in the field artillery drill, of for a battery to do with well drilled horses on any day they have had mounted drills, but I was pleased to have the privilege to do so, as I wanted the work for both men and horses. August 22nd, roll call at Reveille. All officers and men present for duty, and had fine field drills in forenoon and afternoon. Men and horses showed improvement by the day's work.

All came down to work like regulars by evening, and made good improvement in drills. The health of the men was good. Dr. S. E. Yoder, Second Lieutenant of Hattery, took care of the sick or afflicted members without expense to the State, consequently there was no sick report made from the Battery during the encampment. Owing to the death of my wife's mother, by perm I left Camp Lee Forby at about &lt;S p. m., August 23rd, and turned the command of the Battery over to First Lieutenant Alfred McKinnev, a very reliable officer and of fine execu - tive ability. He reports as follows for the remainder of the time the Battery was in camp, August 23rd, 24th, and 25th, 1900: About 8:40 p. m., August 23rd, a very heavy rain and wind storm struck the camp, which lasted until about 1 o'clock, but fortunately only two of our tents went down. One of the mess tents and one of the harness tents. In pur - suance to order of commander of camp, coffee was served to the men after the storm had subsided. August 24th, roll call at Reveille. All officers and men present or accounted for. The daily field orders were fully complied with, and had mounted and dismounted drills in the afternoon. In the afternoon Battery moved with the Brigade down into the city of Hastings and escorted Gover - nor Poynter, our Commander-in-Chief, out to camp, where the Battery fired a salute of seventeen guns, then moving out, took part in parade and review at 6:35 p. m.

"Gen - eral" was sounded at 11 a. m., and one shot fired by the Battery as a signal for all tents to drop in camp, and Battery tents all dropped with the firing of the gun. Tents were neatly folded, tent poles piled up, pins drawn, dinner at 11:30. Broke camp at 12:30, and moved to B. &amp; 11. depot in Hastings, loaded guns, caissons, limbers, horses and all equipments on the cars, and left Hastings at 3 p. m. Made good time to Crete, arriving there about 4:35. Remained there until after 7 p. m., when cars were attached to passenger train and moved for Wymore, where we arrived about 9 p. m., all in good shape. I met the Battery at the depot at Wymore on its arrival and as soon as the cars could be placed in side-track at platform, had horses, guns, caissons and limbers unloaded, horses harnessed and hitched to the guns and caissons, and all Battery tents and other equipments loaded on a dray and moved to the armory, where all equipments were packed away, and the Battery - dismissed at 1:30, Sunday morning, August 26th, 1900. I As to recommendations mentioned in your letter, I feel t it is probably not in place for me to make suggestions o the government and management of the Infantry and airy, I being in the Artillery branch of the service, ich is distinct and separate from either of the others. : I would suggest this, that in future encampments a ct order be issued in regard to officers and men frequent - saloons or becoming intoxicated, and should recommend t if a strict order be issued at future encampments, fixing penalty for any officer entering a saloon in uniform or ng found intoxicated, it should be sufficient ground for dismissal from the service.

McDonnell, Fairbury, Neb.: Sir — I have the honor to report in relation to my ob - servations and actions as an officer of the patrol from Camp Lee Forby under my command in the City of Hastings, Ne - braska, on the night of August 24th, 1900, as follows: I was directed to report to you for duty and did so at about 9 o'clock. The patrol was promptly formed and marched to the gateway entrance to the camp and there loaded in the available public conveyances. As directed by you, I took the names of the drivers of the conveyances and the number of men conveyed by each. I made a report of this to General Barry. Upon the patrol arriving near thescence of disturbance, it was unloaded and promptly formed. A detachment was placed under command of Captain Hartigan. His command went east on First street to Hastings avenue. A detachment placed under my command went east to Hastings avenue on Second street. The disturbance was reported \o be on said avenue, between the streets above named. My detach - ment was deployed upon coming to Hastings avenue, upon which it proceeded south until it met the detachment of Cap - tain Hartigan. A large number of soldiers were in the street where the disturbance occurred, but all were orderly at that time. I was then commanded to patrol Second avenue east, and from the Bostwick hotel south and east, to arrest all drunken or disorderly soldiers, and direct all enlisted men to return to Camp Lee Forby promptly, and in a quiet and orderly manner. After complying with this command, I returned to the rendezvous near the Bostwick hotel on Sec - ond street. At 10:30 p. m. I went out with my detachment, with instructions to arrest all enlisted men found in the city </seg>

Some of the exceptions, however, were such marked instances of flagrant disregard of military authority by men subject to orders, that they ought not to go unnoticed. Private Grove, of Company "C," ist Regi - ment, refused to halt when so commanded, and broke away, when taken in custody, from the guard placing him under Sest, the latter being hindered in the performance of his :y by the vast number of citizens crowding up to him, and finally between him and the prisoner. Private Grove was pursued and only submitted when overpowered. He was placed between the ranks of the detachment, and there continued the use of vile, profane epithets towards the offi - cers and men having him in charge, which characterized his deportment when first arrested. He violated every rule of gentlemanly conduct. He, however, was intoxicated at the time and probably was not acting entirely from natural impulses. He continued the use of abusive language after being taken to the guard house established near the Bost - wick hotel, and only ceased when overpowered by the liquor imbibed. Another instance of resistance was that of a number of members of the ist Regiment Band. They were drink - ing in a saloon on Hastings avenue, between First and Sec - ond streets. I approached them and informed them that ty were under arrest; they refused to march out to the rol, which was placed in front of the house, and I was uired to bring a detail into the saloon and eject them by exhibition of force.

On the way to camp the greater part of the prisoners conducted themselves in a becoming and gentle - manly manner. The exceptions were Private Grove, above mentioned; Sergeant Brown, Company "F," ist Regiment, and Private C. W. Wilson, Company "H," ist Regiment. As the patrol began to move to camp, Private Grove re - newed his tirade of abuse and continued it until overpowered by the liquor he had drank. He was so far overpowered that he was obliged to fall out. A guard of one man was placed over him. After falling out he almost immediately fell into a stupor, and the guard brought him to the guard house of Camp Lee Forby in a carryall. The conduct of Sergeant Brown, Company "F," ist Regiment, and Private C. W. Wilson, Company "H," ist Regiment, was most reprehensible. Regardless of caution - ings, they used the most vile, profane and obscene language towards the officers and men having them in charge, and profanely and abusively referred to other officers of the regiments encamped. With the exception of the three above named, the pris - oners were sent to their quarters under arrest, with orders to report to the Officer of the Guard at the guard house the following morning at 8 o'clock. Those specifically men - tioned were retained at the guard house all night. The patrol was dismissed after the prisoners were taken to their quarters. Repectfully, (Signed) Robert A.

Sir — I herewith tender my report of the proceedings of the Medical Department of the Nebraska National Guard for the year 1899: I received my appointment as Surgeon General and as - sumed the duties of the office early in the year 1899. At that time the Nebraska National Guard was in an unorgan - ized condition following the Spanish-American War. Three regiments from Nebraska had been mustered into the Vol - unteer service of the United States and carried with them all the military supplies possessed by the State. Gen. Barry was organizing a new regiment of Guards to take the place of the 2nd Regiment and had progressed to company or - ganization only. Not a single medic?l officer was a mem - ber of the Guard and not a dollar's worth of property or supplies remained for the Medical Department's use. Prac - tically no Medical Department existed and it became my duty to effect its reorganization under your directions on as efficient a basis as the means at command would permit. I began by writing to the Surgeon Generals of several </seg>
            <seg id="p129">ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. 125 other States, making inquiries relative to their organiza - tions, present condition and how their States treated their Medical Departments in the way of appropriations. To all these inquiries I received courteous replies and much valua - ble information. Particularly from the Surgeon General of Massachusetts, who kindly forwarded me a full supply of the blanks and reports in use by the Medical Department of the Volunteer Militia of Massachusetts. I Agreeable to the Military Code and Rules and Regula - is governing the Nebraska National Guard and defining duties as Surgeon General, I submitted my plans for the lnization of the Medical. Department and prescribed the sical and mental disabilities exempting from military r ice in the Nebraska National Guard to Your Excellency your approval. I set forth the great need of a thor - hly organized Medical Department, and asked that the (ortance of efficient medical service be recognized by nting necessary field chests, surgical instruments, order - ly and hospital corps pouches, stretchers and hospital sup - plies sufficient for an emergency in case the National Guard should be called into service on short notice. I illustrated the need of this by noting the suffering and deaths among the Volunteers that resulted from insufficient medical sup - plies and insufficient preparations having been made for the care of the sick prior to the unexpected call to arms at the breaking out of the Spanish-American War. I requested that I be permitted to attempt the organization of the Med - ical Department for practical rather than dress parade work, to the end that its usefulness might be increased. That the Medical Department, more than any other, holding the life, health and happiness of the officers and men in its custody, </seg>
            <seg id="p130">126 ognized and everything done by the State of Nebraska to dignify its position as a valuable arm of the service. I recommended that all officers and men be subjected to a physical examination before being admitted to any position in the Nebraska National Guard service, holding that the State is entitled to the benefit of the Guardman's services in return for the expense and trouble of educating him for a soldier. That men physically blemished or physically weak would likely fail when subjected to privations in - cidental to military service and thus the State would lose the benefit it had a right to expect from its citizen soldiers. I recommended, however, that the examinations be less exacting than is required for admission to the U. S. service and designated an average between the requirements for admission to the West Point Military Academy and admis - sion to active service in the U. S. Army. I also mentioned diseases that should exempt in all cases. I recommended that all Medical officers should be well educated members of their profession and duly registered as practicing physicians under the Nebraska State laws and like military work be enthusiastic. They should feel that a commission in the Nebraska National Guard does them honor and should be willing to honor the Guard by perform - ing efficient service. I recommended that a reasonable amount of education be expected of each recruit and that he must be free from drunkenness, immoral, dishonest or disreputable habits and altogether morally clean to the end that the very best class of young men be attracted to the Guard. That these requirements would tend to elevate the standing of the National Guards among our citizens and its respectability and good behavior would add honor to the flag of our country and reflect creditably upon the State of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">127 E recommended that three field chests, three surgical and three medical orderly pouches be furnished, one r the Headquarters or Brigade and one each for the md 2nd Regiments. The chests, surgical cases orderly pouches to be supplied with non-perishable es only, necessary for emergencies. I called the attention of Your Excellency to the efficient work done in the Spanish and Philippine wars by the com - pany bearers and the use made of first aid packages and that many deaths and much suffering had been spared our troops by their use by non-medical men in the ranks. Our Military Code not permitting the organization of a Hospital Corps, I recommended that the work of the company bearers be made as efficient as possible and that a hospital corps pouch with contents and a stretcher be supplied each com - pany in the Guard and that they be encouraged to become proficient in the use of first aid packages and in the stretcher drill. I also advised the preparation of a Medical Manual or book of instruction to conform to our existing Military Laws for the use of the National Guard of the State. tl have the honor to state that all my recommendations e fully approved by Your Excellency and I was informed : all reasonable aid would be extended to me in my rts to make the Medical Department of the Nebraska ional Guard effective. May 28th I was ordered to report at the Governor's office, Lincoln, with other members of Your Excellency's staff to attend the funeral services of the late Colonel Stotsenburg, Commander of the First Nebraska, who lost his life during action in the Phillippine Islands and whose body had arrived at the Capitol building, having been </seg>

Lincoln, Neb., July 20, 1899. General Orders, No. 18. I. The Surgeon General of the Nebraska National Guard will prepare Rules and Regulations for the govern - ment of the Medical Department of the Nebraska National Guard, in compliance with Section 7, Chapter 56, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1897. By order of the Governor, (Signed) P. H. Barry, Adjutant General. Agreeable to Order No. 18, I began the compilation of a Medical Manual for the use of the National Guard. My private office was destroyed by fire later in the year and much valuable material, including the preparatory work for this Manual was lost. The work was delayed but in due time I expect to complete it. Mv recommendations for providing a sufficient supply of field chests, surgical cases and instruments, pouches and other medical supplies having been approved by Your Excellency, upon request of Gen. Barry I designated the different arti - cles that I judged should be provided, omitting perishable articles and drugs that could better be provided as needed. Gen. Barry asked for bids from different supply houses and after receiving their bids submitted them to me for ap - proval. Accordingly after a careful examination there ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p133">129 pearing to be little difference in the quality of articles offered, I approved of the one making the lowest price. The arti - cles bought were three field chests complete with bottles and druggist's supplies but without medicines, and each chest nicely lettered with name of brigade or regiment, three sur - geon's field cases with instruments, three orderly pouches, and a hospital corps pouch for each company. These arti - cles were purchased by Gen. Barry and are in his custody at the State House together with stretchers and hospital sup - plies, bedding, etc., purchased later. K General Orders, No. 16, issued from the Adjutant (iener - office June 27th, 1899, contained the following order: "V. In compliance with Section 24, Chapter 56, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1897, a Board of Examination will convene in the Adjutant General's office, Capitol Build - ing, Lincoln, at 8 o'clock a. m., sharp, on Saturday, July 22nd, 1899, f° r tne purpose of examining such persons as may be ordered before it, as in their fitness for positions as commissioned officers in the Nebraska National Guard. Detail for the Board: Brigadier General P. H. Barry, Adjutant General Colonel C. G. Barns, Surgeon General. Colonel Arthur E. Campbell, 2nd Regiment. Captain Eli Hodgins, Company "G," 2nd Regiment. CaptainJohnC. Hartigan, Company "D," 2nd Regiment. The junior member will record the proceedings." Thirty-two officers had been ordered to report for exam - ination and the larger portion of them did so and were first examined as to their physical condition by myself. I also examined Capt. James G. Marron, Surgeon, and Clifford W. Walden, Hospital Steward of the 2nd Regiment and ap - proved them for their respective offices. Subsequently </seg>
            <seg id="p134">130 I:. Marron was appointed to a position in the United es Army and ordered to report for duty in. the Philip- Islands and was not commissioned. Later, Dr. E. A. ■, of Lincoln, Xeb., was appointed Surgeon for the 2nd intent and served during the annual encampment of the raska National Guard for this year. General Orders, Xo. 21, issued from the Adjutant Gen - eral's office, August 16th, 1899, ordered the officers of the General Staff to go into encampment with the 2nd Regi - ment and Troop "A" at Camp Stotsenburg, Lincoln, Xeb., Sept. 9th to 14th, inclusive, for the purpose of holding the annual Camp of Instruction. Agreeable to the order i pro - ceeded to Camp Stotsenburg by a special train that conveyed a portion of the 2nd Regiment and reported for duty to the Adjutant General Sept. 9th and was assigned to the com - mand of the Medical Department by Gen. Barry and at once took charge of the Medical Headquarters and Hospital. I found that Capt. E. A. Carr, Surgeon of the 2nd Regiment, and Hospital Steward Walden had already reported for duty and that the field chests, hospital stores and other medical supplies had been placed at my disposal at the Medical Headquarters. The hospital tent was immediately placed in order, beds arranged and supplied with bedding and dis - pensing tent prepared for active service. I Camp Stotsenburg was located upon a gently sloping, ingular tract of ground in Lincoln Park, bounded by the phitheater and race track on one side and a small, tortu - . stream of water, with timber beyond, bounding the er two sides. The location of the camp was suitable for ', fair weather and a short encampment, but was not such I could approve for changeable or damp weather or for a g occupancy. However, for the time occupied no serious ectton could be made to its location. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">ADJUTANT GKNERAL'S REPORT. 131 I made frequent inspections of the camp, examined the quality of the food and water furnished the troops. The cooking utensils and the sinks for kitchen refuse were the subject of frequent inspection, and the company cooks were examined regarding their proficiency and admonished to cleanliness and proper cooking. The men were inspected in their quarters regarding cleanliness and the use of fruit and melons, that appeared to be quite common on their ar - rival at camp. The latrines and sinks were daily inspected and the different companies directed how to construct them and to daily cover the refuse with fresh earth. The men were directed to ditch around each tent, so that in case of rain the water would easily and surely be carried away from the tents instead of being permitted to flow inside, thus rendering the straw and bedding of the men uncomfortable and damp. Being directed by General Barry to make in - spection the second day and report in writing, I did so, and recommended that the melons. sold in camp by hucksters be prohibited, and that melon rinds thrown under the amphi - theater near the cook rooms of some of the companies be carefully gathered and removed. In compliance with my report, Colonel Campbell, Camp Commander, ordered the sale of melons in the camp to be stopped. !I found that the quality of the water provided for the of the camp was excellent, having been conveyed from deep wells at the State Asylum grounds and supplied rally to the men as needed. I found the quality of the 1 supply abundant and wholesome. The duties of the irtermaster were performed promptly and without caus - any delay in supplies,. and the cooks generally efficient, , generally speaking, professional cooks, hired for that pose by the companies. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">132 ADJUTANT GENERAL'S RKI'OKT. The weather was clear during the entire encampment. The temperature varied greatly from afternoon, when it be - came so warm that several men fell out of the ranks each day during dress parade, exhausted by the heat, to the latter part of the nights, when the temperature became extremely cool. The records kept by the Regimental Surgeon and Hos - pital Steward showed that, in spite of apparently favorable conditions, 132 cases reported for medical treatment number of these were for injuries, more or less serious, that resulted from various accidents, notably from an antiquated and deserted " switchback " in a distant part of the park. But far the greater number reported for minor derangements of the digestive organs, that usually yielded readily to treat - ment. Several instances a high febrile state was reached, but at the close of the encampment all were convalescent and able to return home with their companies, except one private belonging to Company "G," who was left in the City Hospital at Lincoln for further treatment. The extraordinary number of cases to report for treat - ment was nearly all caused by violations of the la ■ health on the part of the Guards and could easily have been avoided had they used caution and judgment about eating fruit, melons, "leather" pies sold by hucksters and at eat - ing stands, and other articles they bought that was not sup - plied by the State. Had they been restrained by their officers from the time they left home till they returned, or had they, themselves, abstained from eating anything ex - cept what was provided by the Quartermaster and cooked by the company cooks, there need have been very little sickness. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">133 members of the Medical Department, and during the en - campment made special effort to interest them in their duties. The companies of the Nebraska National Guard are isolated from each other and are seldom united into regi - mental companionship where they can be under the care of the Regimental Surgeon and Hospital Steward. Under the Nebraska Military Code no provisions are made for medical service or care that will reach isolated companies, except what may be done by members of the company themselves. The company bearers therefore take the place to a greater or less degree of the Surgeons and Hospital Corps. My recommendations were that each Company Commander select the four best men he could possibly find in his company to receive instruction in their duties as company bearers, the use of the first aid package, treatment of minor injuries and minor cases of sickness, and learn the stretcher drill. I repeatedly talked with company officers during the encamp - ment and requested that in making the detail they carefully avoid detailing recruits whose standing in tactics might be low, but to give the very best men for this work. Neither select the bearers from among the best in tactics, but rather because they manifested a willingness to take up the duties required to become efficient nurses. In most companies medical students or druggist clerks may be found who will be pleased to hold such positions. I asked that in each company a "four" of uniform size be chosen, all to be in - telligent and entertain a liking foT the work. I also talked with the members of the companies and in nearly every in - stance my wishes were approved and a zealous promise to assist in every way possible received from company officers and privates alike. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">134 Imand at General Headquarters, and Col. Campbell in mand of the encampment, both highly approved my ts and lent every aid in their power to its furtherance, is permitted to address the officer's school of instruction urged upon the regimental and company officers present importance of improving and encouraging the medical ers and their assistants in the care of the sick. Gen. ry and Col. Campbell both seconded my remarks and mmended that the plans I proposed be adopted. Each day of the encampment a detail of the company bearers was sent to the Medical Headquarters and were in - structed in the principles of "First Aid," bandaging and use of stretcher. In this work I was ably assisted by Capt. Carr, Surgeon of 2nd Regiment, and Dr. Walden, Hospital Steward. II wish to thank Gen. Barry for many favors, not only le in attendance at the encampment, but during the re year. His treatment of his inferiors has been uni - lly courteous and he has shown the true spirit of an :er and a gentleman. He has rendered me every aid in power to make my department an efficient branch of the ice. I believe the efficiency of the National Guard in State is in a great measure due to his skill, zeal and in - try. I believe that the officers and men of the National Lrd of Nebraska will bear me out in the statement that Nebraska National Guard and General Barry are one the same in name and effect. To Colonel Campbell, Camp Commander of Camp Stotsenburg, I wish also to extend thanks for courtesies and favors shown me in the prosecution of my duties. Likewise to my assistants Capt. E. A. Carr and Hospistal Steward Walden. Both these gentlemen performed their duties con - scientiously and efficiently. </seg>
            <seg id="p139">ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. 135 P:ommissioned as a delegate by Your Excellency he meeting of the Association of Military Sur - e Uuited States that was held at Kansas City, 28th and 29th, but regret that I was unable, on private duties, to attend. II respectfully recommend that when the companies of National Guard be again ordered on duty away from le that strict orders be issued to their Company Com - iders prohibiting the indiscriminate use of fruit, confec - ery, dessert and other eatables at irregular hours and in jular quantities by the men on their way to and from r place of destination. The change in their manner of lg and other habits with change and excess in diet is ain to result in sickness until they become "seasoned." Strict orders and appeals to their better judgment might prevail upon the men to eat and drink nothing except the rations provided by the State. If this plan is obeyed the amount of sickness at an annual Camp of Instruction would be trivial. There is no provision in our Military Code providing for a veterinary surgeon for the horses of the cavalry or artillery. Until such provisions are made by the law making powers of the state I recommend that as competent a man as can be found in each company using horses be detailed for duty as veterinary surgeon to have the care of the horses while on dutv. Respectfully submitted, Colonel C. G. Barns, Surgeon General, Nebraska National Guard. </seg>

Hungate of Falls City was nominated and approved as Hospital Steward of the ist Regiment, completing the roster of the force of the Medical Department of the Nebraska National Guard, as provided by the Nebraska Military Code, excepting the company bearer privates. In March of this year the Association of Military Sur - geons of the United States, of which I have the honor to be a member, invited membership from the medical officers of the Nebraska National Guard and I supplemented their in - vitation by personal requests to the different medical gentle - men belonging to the Guard, and others who have seen ac - tive dutv in the volunteer service of the United States. May ist, as an officer on Your Excellency's Staff, I was ordered to report for duty at the Adjutant General's office in Lincoln to attend you in the ceremonies of unveiling and dedicating a cannon upon the State University grounds. The cannon, an antique piece captured from the Spanish in 1898, was dedicated to the State in due form. May ist, obedient to General Orders, No. iS, 1899, I published a Medical Manual for the use of the Ne - braska National Guard. This Manual gave informa - tion relating to duties of medical officers, Hygiene, First Aid in Emergencies, Camping Expedients, Ex - aminations of Recruits and the United States Army Litter Drill. At my request the Adjutant General issued four of these manuals to each company in the Guard, transmitting the following letter to the commanders of each regiment: " I have the honor to inform you that I have forwarded this day to the various companies of your command four copies of Manual of Medical Department for the Nebraska </seg>

General Orders. No. 24. EXTRACT I. In compliance with the provisions of Section 32, Chapter 56, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, the National Guard of this State will assemble in a Camp of Instruction at (place to be designated in subsequent orders), on the 20th day of August, 1900, and remain in camp at said place until the evening of the 25th day of August. II. The annual Camp of Instruction of the Nebraska National Guard for 1900, will be designated Camp Lee Forby, in honor of Captain Lee Forby, late Captain of Com - pany "G," First Nebraska Volunteer Infantry, who died of wounds received in battle, March 29th, 1899. III. Brigadier General P. H. Barry, Adjutant General, Nebraska National Guard, is hereby assigned to the com - mand of Camp Lee Forby, and will take station at the camp during the encampment and will give the necessary orders to assemble the brigade. IV. Colonel C. G.

            <seg id="p145">ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. 141 I was informed by General Barry that the number of men to attend the encampment would probably be double that of last year, and consequently a greater amount of med - ical supplies would be needed. As a part of my duties con - sisted in providing necessary medical supplies for the use of my department, I requested the Regimental Surgeons to for - ward their requisitions for supplies to me, which they did in due time. While supplies were being packed for the en - campment in the Adjutant General's office and store rooms, I visited the store room where the National Guard supplies were kept and overhauled the Field Chests, examined the drugs on hand and packed such as were found to be in good condition, ready for shipment. I deemed one field chest sufficient for the requirements of the occasion, and selected the one belonging to the 2nd Regiment with one case of instruments r.nd one orderly pouch. A small stock of drugs only was ordered at the beginning, it being my theory that better and fresher drugs could be had by ordering as needed. Subsequent results confirmed this opinion. Later orders designated Hastings, Nebraska, as the place for holding the Camp of Instruction. The location selected was the fairgrounds near the city. It was in every way suitable for the purpose, and the citizens supplied abundance of pure water, ice and wood for the use of the command. The main body of the camp consisting of the ist and 2nd Regiments, their regimental headquarters, company officers and regimental bands occupied a long grassy level tract of ground lying alongside the race track. It was well adapted for temporary occupancy by a large number of men, and at no time became dusty and dirty dur - ing dry weather, nor muddy after the severe rain that </seg>
            <seg id="p146">142 I camped some distance apart from each other and the infan - try regiments, and were suitably located. The general headquarters and headquarters of the liudical department were located about 150 yards from the others. Taken alto - gether, the grounds were well chosen, well arranged and suitable in every way for the purpose for which it was used. The only unsanitary condition noticeable was that the privy sinks were too close to the dining and sleeping tents, and should have been 100 vards at least further removed. Upon arrival at the camp I was ordered to organize a brigade hospital and the Regimental Surgeons received or - ders detaching them from their regiments and to report to me with their Hospital Stewards for duty. Act : ve prepara - tion was at once made for the care of those requiring medi - cal treatment. A large tent was erected for a hospital or dispensing tent with a "fly" for a shelter. This tent was used as an office, for making reports, as well as the treat - ment of patients, during -the time the camp was occupied. A double hospital tent erected by the side of this one was occupied by such patients as were too ill to be treated in quarters. I In planning a division of the work I directed that all geons and Stewards be on duty in the morning until all sick presenting themselves at sick call be disposed of. m 9 a. m. during the day and following night one geon with his Steward should be on duty, relieving others. It was my custom to personally inspect the ip and the quarters occupied by the men each morning, in doing this I directed that the Surgeon not on duty at hospital, attend me. In this way I was assisted at in - ction by both Surgeons, each on alternate days. -iL 1U tX. 111., Cdlli Uii\ , LI1C OUI^CUU illlU ilU^JJl Lill JICW" </seg>
            <seg id="p147">143 ard of each regiment reported to me the number of sick in each company of their regiment, the number in hospital, treated in quarters, discharged or carried over. Also, the name, rank, company and diagnosis of disease of each patient. From my inspections of the camp and these re - ports I was enabled to make a fairly correct report of the health of the brigade and sanitary condition of the camp to the Commanding Officer each day. I Between 10 and n a. m. each day the company bear - reported for instruction in "First Aid" and stretcher exercises. These instructions were given by the Sur - is and Dr. Walden, Steward of the 2nd Regiment, and ;ared to interest the company bearers who showed con - rable zeal in taking instruction. They proved useful in :rent ways during the encampment, caring for the com - y sick and promptly bringing the disabled to the hos - 1 on their company stretchers. At inspection each morning the men were carefully ad - vised regarding their personal habits, the care of their bed - ding and tents. They were advised against the use of un - usual food and fruit and to open wide their tent flaps for some time each day and airing well their sleeping places, bedding and clothing. They were advised as a matter of comfort, in case of rain, to carefully ditch around each tent to prevent the ingress of water, thus preventing unhealthy dampness. The kitchens and dining halls were carefully inspected and the cooks compelled to promptly dispose of kitchen refuse in properly prepared and properly kept sinks. The officers in all instances lent every aid to accomplish the desired result and were always courteous. To the credit of the men it may be said that they heeded the admonitions in nearly every instance and appeared to wish to do their part towards promoting the health of the camp. </seg>

Many tents were blown down and many cases of chilling occurred from exposure to the rain, but in most instances no harm was done. This was largely due to the thoughtfulness of the Commanding Officer, Gen. Barry, who issued orders that the company cooks should have hot coffee served to the men before going to bed. On another occasion a private in one of the infantry companies was severely injured in a fight in a saloon down towu and brought to the hospital under guard, perfectly furious and wild with pain. It required the entire medical force as well as his guard to control him during which time his Orderly Sergeant fell unconscious from exhaustion. I then had the injured private sent to the guard house where his injuries were dressed after tying him with ropes and having him forcibly restrained by the guards. His injuries appearing serious to his comrades, a riot was precipitated and several hundred men left camp for town seeking re - venge, followed by a Provost Guard to prevent trouble. There appearing to be a possibility of casualties occurring I directed Hospital Steward Walden to accompany the guard with a dressing case. However no further injuries were re - ported. During dress parade, on different di.ys, several cases of heat prostration occurred and of minor cases of sickness at other times that usually yeilded readily to treatment. Few cases were severe enough to require detention in the hospital, but were treated in company quarters and watched by the company bearers. Few instances of maling - ering were noted and altogether the health of the camp was remarkably good. I attribute this desirable condition </seg>
            <seg id="p149">145 partly to obedience to the advice given by the medical officers regarding hygiene and food and to a growing ambi - tion on the part of the officers and men to raise the health standard during camp life, the necessity of which was made apparent by the experience of the volunteers recently in the service of the United States. As a rule the officers and men of the Nebraska National Guard are a fine class of men, physically, intellectually and morally. A very large proportion of them would pass the physical examination necessary for admission to the United States service. Many of them are well educated and in civil life occupy positions of trust. Among them the professions are well represented, and bank employes and those follow - ing clerical occupations are numerous. College and high school students, clerks in stores, farmers and business men are plentiful among those carrying muskets. In selecting company bearers it was quite easy to find medical students and drug clerks who willingly accepted the positions. I do not claim that ALL the National Guardsmen attending the Encampment of Instruction at Hastings this year were of the desirable class here mentioned, but by far the larger part of them were. There were unfortunate exceptions, but the Nebraska National Guard, as now constituted, should be a source of pride to the State. This high standard should be encouraged bv the exclusion of all undesirable men, as required by the rules governing the examination of recruits. In prosecuting my duties I was rendered every assis - tance possible by the officers of the Guard who were uni - formly gentlemanly and courteous. The men were no doubt annoyed by the frequent inspections and advice given them regarding their quarters, but in no instance can I 10 </seg>

The medical officers of both regiments proved them - selves to be well qualified and progressive practicing physi - cians and men of large experience, tending to make them desirable as Surgeons for the State service. Both Regi - mental Hospital Stewards are physicians engaged in active practice and Dr. Walden, Steward of the 2nd Regiment, served his eighth year at Nebraska National Guard encamp - ments this year and the value of his services are not to be overestimated. My commission will expire and my duties as Sur - geon General end January ist, and I may be pardoned if I digress from plain statements that should be con - tained in a formal report, to say a few words regard - ing the Nebraska National (iuard as it exists since its reor - ganization. There is little of the "tin soldier" feature of militia soldierly noticeable. The encampments of 1899 and 1900 were both profitable schools of instruction and free from "gold braid" and "dress suit" features that usually characterize such gatherings. The work done in all de - partments was practical and the camps were veritabK diers' camps, fraught with soldiers' work. Many of the officers and men are veterans of the Spanish and Philippine wars and their experience adds greatly to the efficiency of the present Guard. Cren. Barry, who has served six years as Adjutant General, is a man of rare ability as an execu - tive and an organizer. To this has been added year&gt; of military service during the War of the Rebellion and a long and successful business life. He has been earnest and com - petent in the discharge of his duties, and to him, to a great degree, belongs the credit of the present organization of the </seg>
            <seg id="p151">ADjrTANT r.KXERAL'S REPORT. 147 Guard. I feel that the State of Nebraska should look upon its National Guard as upon a favorite son and not be too close with the purse strings in providing for its support. I recommend that the Legislature be requested to amend the Military Code to provide for two Surgeons for each regi - ment. The senior Surgeon to rank as Captain, as at pres - ent, and the junior to rank as First Lieutenant. I also rec - ommend that their positions be made permanent, once they are appointed, and that they be commissioned for three years as are other officers of the Guard. They are now - classed as staff officers, yet their duties can hardly be classed with staff officers' duties, because they are usually detached from their regiments under the present customs of the United States, as well as National Guard service. In case of the resignation or promotion of the officer to whose staff the Surgeon is attached, the Surgeon is removed from the service, whereas other staff officers are usually detailed, and a change of superiors only returns them to their origi - nal positions. The position of Brigade Surgeon should be made permanent in the same way recommended for Regi - mental Surgeons. Two Surgeons are needed for each in - fantry regiment, but three, as the United States service al - lows, are more than necessary. I recommend that the part of the Military Code relating to company bearers be left as it is, as experience has shown that it is a very wise and useful provision and successful in practice. I further recommend such change in the laws that will permit the appointment of a Veterinary Surgeon in either the cavalry or artillery branch of the National Guard serv - ice. Such medical officers could be detailed at encamp - ment to care for the numerous horses employed for use of </seg>

The American National Red Cross is arranging to I in every village and city in the United States, on the it of December 31st, watch meetings to see the Old Cen - out and the New Century in, and it is eminently proper the National Guard should take the initiative in ar - ming for such meetings in Nebraska. The Red Cross So - y of almost every country in the world has a large per - lent sustaining fund, so that the occurrence of any great mity, such as recently visited the city of Galveston, s them in a position to offer the most valuable of all assistance, first relief. It is to place the society in America on .1 solid financial basis that this movement is undertaken. II. The officers of the Nebraska National Guard, in the various towns and cities where military organizations exist, are expected to take up this movement and make ar - rangements for the meetings mentioned in Paragraph I., to be held in the company armories or other suitable place, and endeavor to interest the people in their respective localities in such movement, and give to it every encouragement in their power. It is not expected that the movement shall be con - fined to the National Guard . As the purpose of the move - ment is an universal benefaction, the promoters and con - tributors should extend to all the people ; and to this end the officers of the National Guard should confer with and ask the assistance of the people, and of civic, patriotic and musical societies, in order that such meetings may be made interesting and profitable.

The simpler ones are fully equal to a field 5 outfit of a regular army company. With a few excep - 5, all of the companies own sheet-iron or gasoline cook - stoves. 20. Property accountability — Nature of. Are regula - tions !n regard to strictly enforced? Under the rules required by regulations, and now strictly enforced, all officers receiving property are required to receipt therefor. Each Captain is required to give a bond of $2,000 to cover his responsibility of property. The com - pany "quarterly return" embraces a list of property "on hand." When issues are made in the "quarter," these returns are examined to see if the property has been taken i2i. Subsistence — Rations. Component parts of . How ished? How prepared? The new " Rules and Regulations for the Government of the Nebraska National Guard " prescribes the same com - ponent parts for the ration as in the regular army. At the last encampment (as at the previous one) each Company Commander was paid 30 cents per man for the number of men reported in camp that day, and he or the Quartermaster Sergeant purchased such articles of food as seemed to suit the taste of the company best. The food was prepared, in most instances, by civilian cooks, who were brought from the home stations of the companies. I made several inspections of the kitchens, and, as a rule, found the cooking well done. When ordered by the Commander-in-Chief, the following articles may be issued in addition to the regular army ration: 15 pounds of butter, 100 eggs, 100 pounds of potatoes, 5 </seg>

Pay and allowances. t Officers receive, while in camp or in active service, the e pay as in like grades in the regular army, without ease for service. Officers ordered on special service ive such compensation as may be allowed by the Com - der-in-Chief. All enlisted men receive $1 per day and ration, or commutation therefor, for each day's service. 23. Stores, (a) Purchase of. (b) Medical supplies. I (a) Stores are purchased in open market by the Quar - aster General. ( bj Medical supplies are purchased in market by the Surgeon General. 24. Personnel and discipline. The Nebraska National Guard is composed of as fine a body of young men, physically and morally speaking, as can be found anywhere. It seems to be the aim of most, if not all, of the companies to keep bad material of any de - scription out of their ranks. In the matter of discipline, I find them obedient, eager to learn, respectful to their offi - cers and civil to each other. There is not that distance be - tween the officers and their men that there is in the regular service, nor can it be expected in the National Guard. I note, however, a marked improvement each year in the ex - change of official courtesies. Junior commissioned officers and enlisted men were more particular in saluting their su - periors than formerly. Careful instruction in this matter was enjoined by the Brigade and the Regimental Com - manders. 25. Theoretical instruction. Lin nearly all the companies, schools of instruction of missioned officers and non-commissioned officers have </seg>
            <seg id="p496">485 ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. been held during the past year. The instruction in most of the companies has been confined to the authorized drill and Small Arms Firing Regulations, but in some companies considerable instruction has been given in minor tactics and military field engineering. It may be in place here to re - mark that in several companies of the Guard, promotion to the position of non-commissioned officers depends upon the candidate's knowledge of drill regulations, etc. 126. Guard duty — How performed. Officers and non - missioned officers well instructed. Sentinels well in - cted. Any outpost duty. tAt all the encampments visited by myself, I observed guard duty was performed in a very creditable manner, ly of the officers, non-commissioned officers and men wing a thorough knowledge of it. As a rule, I found sentinels well instructed and able to properly turn over r instructions to the Officer of the Day and other officers he guard. There is a marked improvement in this k over last year. No outpost duty. 27. Target practice — Cavalry, artillery and infantry. Range and gallery. Any held at home stations. Quantity of, and system of instruction and classification. I In accordance with orders from the Adjutant General's :e, the season of target practice commenced June 1st, will close on November 30th. In accordance with the er of the Brigade Commander, two hours of the last day he company encampments were to be devoted to target ctice. This, however, was found to be impracticable in st of the companies, as ranges could not be found in ximity to the camp. In fact, it is very difficult for most he companies to find suitable ranges within a reasonable tance of their home stations. The Small Arms Firing </seg>

Transportation. • • • The railroad facilities are excellent, reaching every settled portion of the State. Every company of the Guard has its home station on a railroad, the major portion of the Guard being on the main lines. The Missouri River, form - ing the eastern boundary of the State, is the only navigable stream. 29. Regulations — Nature and date. The present regulations in use in the Guard were ap - proved by the Governor, July 9th, 1897; but on account of un - avoidable delays in printing, were not issued to the t - until December. The regulations are very complete in de - tail, and in my opinion are perfectly adapted to the guidance Kthe National Guardsman. They conform as nearly to the of the United States Army as the military code of the State will admit. 30. Maps — Scale and character. Map showing stations of various companies of the Guard. 31. Armories — Location and description. Each company rents its own armory, excepting the company at Madison, which at the expense of the members and some outside aid, has erected a very suitable armory. As a rule, the rented armories are quite suitable for the purpose. 32. Arsenals — Location and description. None. 33. Independent commands in State. Five independent companies. These commands are not equipped or supported in any way by the State. No reports are rendered to this office. These commands were </seg>

Such remaiks as you may deem advisable to make ny subject not mentioned above relative to conditions r to April 20th, 1898. The experience of the past eighteen months has dem - onstrated the necessity of holding in reserve in the arsenals or military store rooms in this State, sufficient equipment in addition to that already held by the State, to arm and equip the National Guard to the maximum strength when called into active service; and to enable the various States to do this, I would recommend that the amount of the appropria - tion, as provided in Section 1661, "Revised Statutes of the United States," be increased from $400,000 to the amount necessary to provide for the equipment necessary for troops in active service. The stores would always be at the com - mand of the Quartermaster General of the United States Army, and it would not necessitate any settlement between the several States and the United States, in the event of troops being ordered into the United States service.

Receipt of order for moblization of troops for muster in - to the volunteer service, was received on April 25th, 1898. On May 9th and 10th, 1898, both regiments were mustered into the United States service. Troop "A," Nebraska Na - tional Guard, was mustered in. May 14th, 1898. On Mav 16th, 1898, the 1st Regiment embarked for San Francisco, California, en route for Manila; on May 20th, the 2nd Rtui - ment embarked for Chickamauga Park, Ga.; on May 22nd, Troop "K," 3rd U. S.

In the matter of mobilizing the troops of this State on receipt of the i dent's order, a detail of competent officers and men made from Company "IV 2nd Regiment, and Company "I&gt;," 1st Regiment, on special duty at the Adjutant Gen - eral's office. These officers and men, being professional and business men, and also good officers, were of great assistance to the Adjutant General, in the performance of his work at this period. Telegraphic instructions were forwarded to the several Company Commanders to move their commands by regular train, which would arrive at Lincoln at a special time, and to subsist their men en route, and to bring them all bedding and clothing (civilian if necessary ). that would be required to protect the health of the men during the period of encampment.

Contracts were let to wholesale merchants in Lincoln, for subsistence, based on the ration as provided in regulations of the United States Army. Deliveries were made by these merchants, as desired by the commissary offi - cer. All commissary supplies were issued on requisition blanks, and instructions were given to see that men had plenty of good, wholesome food, and no complaint was re - ceived in the matter of messing commands at Camp Alvin Saunders. During the period of mobilization, a very cold rain set in, and by reason of the frequency of the rains at this period, it made it very difficult to exist in the camp with any degree of comfort. The largest number of men sick in hospital at any time, was one per cent., which speaks volumes for the health and vigor of the young man - hood of the Xebraskans, comprising these regiments. Replying to your circular letter of July 26th, asking my views on the following questions: 1. In the light of experience in the recent war, what points do you regard as the most suitable in your State for mobilization and concentration of volunteers? Either Lincoln or Omaha. 2. What are your views relative to mobilization and concentration of State troops in case of war in the future? In reply will say, that the State has excellent railroad facilities, east, west and northwest, and in the north-eastern portion. The troops could be mobilized at the following points, viz: Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings, Fremont, and Grand Is - land, Nebraska. These points are named, because they are the principal labor and railroad centers of the State. Omaha, </seg>
            <seg id="p503">492 for service in the east and southeast; Fremont for service in the northeast; Lincoln for service in the south; Hast - ings for service in the west, and Grand Island for service in the northwest. With special railroad service, the National Guard of this State could be concentrated at any of these points, within twenty-four hours. The point of mobiliza - tion would all depend upon the future movement of the troops, the service they were to perform, and the advantages of obtaining supplies and equipment.

And in compliance with vour request I forward you herewith an amendment to an amendment to abstract of ex - penses incurred by the Governor of the State of Nebraska in mobilizing and maintaining the 1st and 2nd Regiments, Nebraska Volunteer Infantry, and Troop "K," 3rd United States Volunteer Cavalry, for muster into the service of the United States; and have this day forwarded to you by ex - press, under separate cover, the individual checks which constitute a part of the enclosed amendment. Also find enclosed herewith an itemized receipt for the above-named checks, which you will please sign and re - turn to this office. I beg to state that the checks in payment of the claims of the following-named enlisted men, as appear upon the pay rolls now on file in your office, having not yet been re - ceived at this office from the banks who made payment thereon, are not contained with the checks before mentioned, but will be forwarded to you as soon as received, viz: Company "H," 1st Regiment, John S.

Also, among the checks of Company "H," 2nd Regi - ment, will be found check No. 431, for $6.00, issued to Harry H. Reische, in payment of his claim of $14. 00, the remaining $8.00 having been paid, to wit: Upon present - ing himself for muster into the volunteer service, Mr. Reische was rejected upon physical examination; but he accompanied his command to Chicamauga Park, Georgia, as civilian clerk to Captain Fisher, and when the pay rolls were being prepared for the payment of those mustered in, for services rendered from April 27th to May 4th, inclusive, 1898, he was erroneously entered upon ."-aid pay rolls, and received payment thereon in the sum of $8.00. The State of Nebraska was not reimbursed for this specific expend - iture at the time reimbursement was made on those pay rolls, on account of his name not appearing upon the mus - ter-in rolls of Company "H," 2nd Regiment, Nebraska Volunteer Infantry. Hence, reimbursement of this $8. 00 is sought by the State of Nebraska upon the rolls now on file in your office, in payment of rejected officers and enlisted men. Very respectfully, (Signed) \Y. A.

The tent pins referred to are expendable and were evi - dently all expended while in camp at Camp Saunders, as the regiment brought away no full crates of pins.

I assume that all the headlines are the work of the Lincoln office and amounts to a judgment rend - ered as to the official acts of the Governor, Adjutant General and Military Representative cf the State without their evei being heard. The first headline "Bills in bad shape." I All bills sent to me were made on tmiform vouchers as vided by Section 5061, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, .ion of 1897, an d were printed on blue paper as provided Section 6050, same statute. Each one bears the ap - val of the Governor signed by his own hand and nearly the affidavits were made before the Secretary of State and •sted by an impress of the "Great Seal of the State of Draska." Accompanying the bills was an elaborate ab - ict addra6sed to the Secretary of War, with the following ition: " Abstract of expenses incurred in mobilizing and main - taining the 1st and 2nd Regiments, Nebraska Volunteer Infantry, and Troop "K," 3rd Regiment, United States Vol - unteer Cavalry, for muster into service of the United States, as per bills hereto attached, and marked exhibits as follows, towif."

            <seg id="p675">664 office referring the same to the State Claims Commission; the blue vouchers are in a pasteboard box, with ciii' ments on every side except the bottom of what is contained in. The vouchers and abstracts I received by ex some time in the month of July, but was told by the Office that it was no use to file them until the Auditor of the War Department issued a circular in the matter, which would be about August 10th. I thought I was showing due diligence when I appeared at the War Office at 9 o'clock in the forenoon, which was the exact time it opens, August ith my box of vouchers and letter of transmit - tal. After getting the necessary endorsement on the letter of transmittal at the Adjutant General's office, I refused the offer of a me to carry them to the State Claims Commission, and took all the papers there in person, and here informed that I was the first man who had ap - '1 there with his papers officially referred. I was granted the first hearing before that Commission, which was on August 1 ith, 1898, and was examined at great length by the members of the Commission as to the law or our State touching the expenditures for the National Guard. I was em that the whole matter was in a most excellent shape, but that there had been a delay in the issuance of the Auditor's circular, and would have to await an order based on that circular. &lt; &gt;n August 16th I received Circular No. ml the letter of trausmittal which is hereto attached, advising me that a copy of the same circular had been sent to the Governor of the State of Nebraska. A few days after that I was informed by the Claims Commission that all of the papers won! erred to the Auditor for the War </seg>
            <seg id="p676">665 of law a&gt; required by the State of Nebraska, and all that would be necessary would be an auditing to determine if tlie charges were correct, the certificate required by the cir - cular, and a decision by the Auditor if he would pay that part of the claim which showed to have been p ;id before vouchers for payment were filed for the whole claim. Being advised that the circular had gone forward to the Governor, and knowing the painstaking care and prompt nea iction of public business by the Governor and tb&lt; jutant General in military matters, I waited two days, and, sure enough, here came the certificates required by the cir - cular as to the payment of the two regiments, Dr. Criffen's and Mr. Mumford's claims. I immediately went before the Auditor of the War Department, filed the certificate with a letter of transmittal, and he kindly sent for the papers, and I made an argument to the effect if he would allow us what we had already paid, we would at once pay all of the other claims in cash, and the State of Nebraska would wait for its money. He told me that wonid involve the making of a precedent and that he would refer the same to the Comp - troller of the Treasury and would promptly advise me as to his decision. At this time, viz: September 3rd, 1898,3:40 p. 111., Eastern time, I have not heard nor been advised by letter, and have been frequently told for a week last past by officials in the Auditor's department that no decision had been made by the Comptroller in paying a part of the State's claims. On August 19th, 1898, which was three days after Cir - cular 154 had reached me, I forwarded to the Governor an amendment to the account which to my mind at that time fully met all of the requirements of Circular 154.

An elevator will take von to the floor upon which the office is located, and an accomodating messenger will, upon application, escort you to the room. I go into all these details to the end that the State Journal force at Lincoln, Xeb., or its Washington: representative, desires to see any of the papers, it will require but little diligence to find them. From reading Mr. Annin's communication, I take it that he failed to find the two letters of transmittal with papers attached, but probably found the pay rolls in the process of being checked with rolls in the Department. I have never heard an utterance from any official authorized to speak in the matter that anything about the Xebraska ac - counts would have to be returned for correction. And be - lieving that the officers in the Auditor's Department mean to do the right thing, though obstructed somewhat by red tape regulations, and having confidence that their word im - parts verity, I shall continue to believe that none of the accounts of the State will have to be returned to Xebraska, the State Journal to the contrary, notwithstanding. I sup - pose that Mr. Attain, in the exercise of all due diligence, found that the State claims arising from the war with Spain were referred to the Auditor for the War Department to the Review Division, of which Hon.

If Mr. Annin mentioned that fact is article it was not in that particular State Journal that es to me. I deem it proper ro add that owing to the extremely and depressing weather I would not like to impose too great a task on a diligent Washington correspondent, but I think the readers of the State Journal would greatly appreciate an article from Mr. Annin explaining in detail the 1 methods of the Republican administration of the State of Illinois, that claims $300,000.00 for eight regiments that were held fifteen or an average of $37,500.00 per regiment, contrasted with the claim of the State of Nebraska, that held two regi - ments fourteen days and a troop of cavalry for a few days, and presents a bill of $23,412.69, of which $11,235.98 was paid to the soldiers. tAnd again, appreciating the depressing effects of the in - e heat of the city, I call attention to the article under head "Claims from Illinois," first column, fourth page, irday, August 27th, 1898, issue Washington Post, as to number of regiments, days held and amount claimed by Governor of the State of Illinois.

However, I think that the camp ks well for the quality of the water. I During the afternoon we watched very closely the OUS companies drill, under the respective Hattalion inlanders, and noted with satisfaction the marvelous ancement made by this regiment in drill and discipline. itary courtesies were properly observed between the -ers and men, and this regiment, like all the other &gt;raska regiments, reflects great credit on the State of &gt;raska. On our return from drill inspection, we personally &lt;1 the various companies in their quartets, and noted with satisfaction the very comfortable manner that the men of this regiment had their tents arranged. Most of them were floored with pine lumber, which is very cheap here, and in some cases the tents were raised from the ground, and sleeping apartments on the second story. The camp is located on sandy soil, with very little shade, which accounts for the dry condition of the camp. The sanitary condition of the camp is excellent, due to the great care and efficiency exercised by the Colonel and Medical Officers. I At the close of our inspection and visit with the various panies, we repared to the officers' mess, where Colonel an awaited us. In the afternoon we visited the Division Hospital, and found no very serious cases among the Nebraska boys.

After all had passed in review, we again turned to the headquarters of the 3rd Regiment, and at 7:30 in the evening the Governor met the officers and men of the 3rd Regiment in a large tent used for church services, and made a very able and patriotic address to the officers and men, commending them for the very excellent work they had done, after which other acV.

            <seg id="p687">676 Nebraska Volunteer Infantry, 2nd Brigade, 3rd Army Corps, Camp George H. Thomas, Chickamauga, (ia. I found the condition of the camp very good, made so by the labor of the men, who brought in a large amount of stone and gravel, pounding the same into the red clay, and thereby keeping the companies' streets clean and in excel - lent condition. The camp is well located; some of the tents of the en - listed men were floored with pine lumber, and in this connection I wish to state that it is regretted very much that all were not floored with pine lumber. The food is excellent and well served, and the appetite of the men speaks volumes for the healthful vigor of the Nebraska climate. The one thing that we found that is to be regretted was the large number of men sick in quarters. (Sick in quarters generally means those who are slightly ill, yet not ill enough to be sent to the hospital, and who are treated daily by the Regimental Surgeon until they are returned to duty.) kBut in the 2nd Regiment, on the morning of the 12th, ( iovernor and myself attended Sick Call at the Regimental Hospital and Dispensary, and were surprised at the large number of men as reported sick. I requested the Surgeon, Captain If; A. Robert, to furnish me a copy of the report, and in substance it is as follows: "In hospital, 32; sick in quarters, 102; total, 134." Standingin the groupof sick men, and lookingthemover, I was rather surprised at the large amount of suffering existing amongst them, and in talking with them, I found that many of them had been sent to the General Hospital, and returned from the hospital back to the regiment, and reported for </seg>
            <seg id="p688">677 I to go to duty or again be treated by the Regiinental ,'eon. The company officers knew that these men were weak for the performance of the duty of a soldier, and ired them in every possible way, and tried to induce n to go back to the General Hospital. These convalesc - sick refused, stating that they believed it impossible for n to come back to the regiment if they had to endure the pital treatment as they had experienced it at their divi - al hospital. tA case was found where a man was going around on dies; some were seriously sick with malarial fever in com - y quarters, and some with that most serious of all diseases ng soldiers are liable to contract, homesickness, and for ch the only medicine that can cure their ailment is to irn to their homes. After the visii to the sick it was deemed proper by the Governor and myself to go and visit the Division Hospital, which we found in a very crowded condition, and for which the Surgeon in charge was not to blame. They seemed to be willing to give all the comforts and all the accommoda - tions, but somebody and somewhere are responsible for the lack of sufficient nurses in caring for these sick men. I was informed that nearly 300 men were in the hospital, crowded in tents so close that not another one could get in, with a limited number of nurses detailed from the Hospital Corps who had to do twelve hours' nursing and do their guard and police duty, which means the work of cleaning up the I We especially were interested in the Nebraska boys, while there were not many serious cases amongst them, I regret very much that the Medical Department could have cired for the sick more efficiently, at the proper </seg>
            <seg id="p689">678 'ing to ascertain if their could be no way to relieve things, the Governor deemed it best to call on Major R. E. Giffen, in charge of the Sternburg U. S. General Hospital, who formerly being Surgeon General of the State, we knew that we could approach and that he would be willing to help in any way possible. Major Giffen received us very kindly, showed us through the hospital (then in course of construction), and which ■ cady to receive patients from the various Division Hos - pitals, and thereby relieve their very crowded condition. We are pleased to bear testimony of the favorable services of this officer, who has sacrificed a very large lucrative practice, and a man who stands at the head of his profession and who was willing to enter the United States service with the rank of Major, and thereby abandon his profitable prac - tice, in order that he might assist and relieve in his own way, the suffering of a volunteer soldier. Dr. Giffen is a man very well qualified for the selections made by General Sternburg, and the Governor desires that you should present to General Sternburg the great injustice being done I&gt;r. Giffen, in permitting him to remain to the rank of Major. The Governor believes that a man of his great professional and executive ability, should at least be promoted to the rank of Colonel. After presenting the condition of the sick in quarters and Division Hospital to Dr. Giffen, we recommended that as many as possible of the sick soldiers be returned to their homes, in compliance with General Orders, No. 114, Adju - tant General's office. The difficulty, however, in earning out the provision of General Orders, No. 114, seemed to be that there being only one General Hospital in camp, viz: — the Leiter Hospital, all of these men sick in Division Hos- </seg>
            <seg id="p690">679 pital and convalescent in camp, could not avail themselves of the benefits of General Orders, No. 114, and the Governor therefore desires that you would request the Secretary of War to extend the provision of General Orders, No. 114, to the Division Hospitals, so that these sick and convalescent soldiers may be returned to their respective homes as soon as they are able to travel, and thereby relieve the hospitals of a very large number of patients. One of the necessary and desirable things in connection with the care of the sick at Camp George H. Thomas, is a convalescent hospital or camp, where the men returning from the hospital may be placed; a camp where they can be properly dieted and cared for, until they are sufficiently strong again to return to their respective companies for duty.

While the new law fixed the arriving at Battalion or Regimental rendezvous as the time of commencement of pay; yet I strenuously contended that as the law of our State required the Governor to first call out the Guards upon the requisition of the President, that we had company ren - dezvous by force of law and the United States was therefore estopped to deny liability.

C: I Sir — I have the honor to hand you herewith the requi - jn, and sundry exhibits attached thereto, of the Governor he State of Nebraska, asking for restoration in kind of military stores that went to the field with the 1st and Regiments of Nebraska Volunteer Infantry and Troop t' 3rd United States Volunteer Cavalry. A part of e several commands were regularly organized militia of State of Nebraska and known as the 1st and 2nd Regi - ts and Troop "A" of the Nebraska National Guard. Permit me to suggest that an examination of the papers and of the question involved is full of difficulties by reason of the different degrees of care which the stores have re - ceived while in the hands of the officers of the States, the different policies of Governors in the matter of permitting such military stores to go forward with the volunteers or held in the State, and the failure on the part of some of the States to comply with the provisions of the Act entitled, "An Act to amend Section 1161 of the Revised Statutes, making an annual appropriation to provide arms and equip - ment for the militia (24 U. S. Statutes at Large, 401)," which provides *for an annual accounting and certain re - quirements to be determined by a board of survey, militia officers. I Permit me further to suggest that a careful examina - n of all data available to me brings me to two conclu - ns — one to restore the military stores at their valuation fixed by the receiving officers of the volunteer forces; the ler, to restore in kind what went forward to the field. II respectfully recommend that under all the circum - nces the restoration in kind is the more liberal policy, </seg>
            <seg id="p710">699 and is the only one possible to make a rule of universal ap - plication among the States. Permit me to call your attention to the fact that under the law the title to the property is at all times in the General Government and that the States are bailees, and that for their officers to determine what property is unserviceable or unsuitable is erroneous and contrary to ordinary provisions of law. The liability to the State for such property should be fixed by officers of the owners of the property — that is, the General Government, and I indulge in the hope that you will make recommendation so that Section 4 of said Act may be amended along the line indicated.

In reply, I would say that perhaps we were a little hasty in assuming that the volunteer troops now in the Philippines would be returned in precisely the order in which they went out, such order possibly being impractica - ble. The most we can say at this time is that General Otis has been directed to return to the United States upon the transports in which the regular troops arrive as many volun - teers as he can spare at the time, and the selection of the regiments to be thus returned has been necessarily left to his judgment. The fact that the rst Nebraska Volunteers formed a part of the second expedition warrants the probability that it will be among the very first to be returned. Very respectfully, (Signed) H. C.

Your Department sent this Lieutenant to Lincoln to muster-in this regiment, and his record from the very first has been one of intrigue to gain wn promotion. He seems to have hypnotized Gover - nor Holcomb so completely that all ideas of promotion by seniority were set aside. We do not care to go into the dark and disgraceful history connected with the muster-in of this Nebraska regiment. Suffice it to say that the name of Major Scharman erroneously appeared as having failed to the medical examination, when as a matter of fact he did pass, as subsequently admitted by the Governor, and the vacancy thus erroneously or fraudulently created, made pos - sible the appointment of the Lieutenant, John II. Stotsen - burg, to the position of Major. The same tactics displayed at the outset have been em - ployed at Manila, and your Lieutenant who ought to be with his own regiment, has finally succeeded by intrigue in riding over his superior officers and gainiuy the Colonelcy. When Colonel Bryan resigned in the 3rd Regiment, promotions were made in regular order by senority, which was right, just and proper. Not so in the 1st. Not only have all rules of seniority been overthrown, but officers are trans/erred from strange companies, in order to ieward those who signed the Stotsenburg petition for promotion, and not for the good of the service. Out of six promotions recently made on Stotsenburg's recommendation, five were those who had signed his own petition, and in almost every case meritori - ous officers and riien, who had shown their valor in battle and who were fairly entitled to promotions, were "jumped." They were brave men, but had recommended Lieutenant- </seg>

Such conduct might olerated in a politician, but it is a disgrace to the army, such rank injustice, however smothered by a tyrannical mel, will not down. But it does not stop there. Colonel senburg is guilty of petty tyranny towards those who not favor his promotion. This element in his character Id make him a dangerous man as a commander of a eom - ider of a company even, and so much worse in a regi- KThe fathers and mothers have been very apprehensive months, and have known something of his despicable duct toward the men, but have hesitated to complain for it would make the condition worse. What a sad commentary on the great War Department, when the fathers and mothers, who freely offered their sons upon the alter of their country, are made to feel that, escap - ing the pestilence of the trenches and Spanish bullets, their brave boys are subjected to petty annoyance and humiliation at the hands of such an officer. We are proud of our boys; they have made a glorious record in trenches and battlefield, and we cannot tell you how it pains us to know that they are subjected to the insults and humiliation of this brutal officer, whom we do not even know personally. More than that, we never want to know him. His infamous conduct has madp a chasm between him and every one of the fathers and mothers, at least of Colonel L., that would forbid any personal relations or acquaintance in the future. You may consider this strong language; the case demands it. We cannot tell you the whole truth, foi as yet we do not know it. As the fathers and mothers and those having friends in 45 </seg>

When Governor Holcomb cabled Manila for a re - port of the condition of the regiment with a view of being mus - tered out, by Colonel Stotsenburg's order many of the sick were arbitrarily ordered to fall in, in order to make a record favorable to his reply. So brutal was his conduct and so vigorous the protest of some of the Commanding Officers of companies, that the doctor said while he was doing it by Stotsenburg's personal order, he (the Surgeon i declared that if it was not rescinded he would resign. The actual condi - tion of the men and their wishes as to the muster-out, was not correctly sent on Governor Holcomb, so far as made 2nd.

Colonel Stotsenburg is charged with personally endeavoring to collect this illegal and unlawful assessment of $30.00 from one company, and when the Captain refused Kay it or permit his men to do so, he advised with and d Colonel Bratt to place such Captain in arrest for dis - iience of orders that he knew at the time to have been unlawful and an unauthorized attempt to extort money from private soldiers. h. As a further punishment for their refusal to pay the arbitrary assessment, Colonel Stotsenburg, without con - sulting the Collector of the Port at Manila, caused to be Ied an order relieving Company " L " from duty at the torn House. In the company are many privates who are erts in the business world, nearly all of whom gave up salaried positions of from $2, 000.00 per year down to $600.0 j, to serve their country at $15.00 per month. They have filled every position assigned to them in the Custom House in a highly satisfactory manner since first they entered Ma - nila, but Colonel Stotsenburg discovered an opportunity to deprive these young, energetic business men of a little addi - tional compensation, and it is easy to be seen that his order was born of revenge and not for the good of the service. General Otis promptly rescinded his order, but how long the Colonel's kindly considerate order for the best welfare of the men will remain suspended, is problematical. 9th.

Adjutant General, 2nd Division, 8th Army Corps: Sir — I have the honor to submit the following report of an investigation made by me of certain charges preferred by relatives and friends of enlisted men of the 1st Nebraska Infantry, United States Volunteers, against Colonel John M. Stotsenburg, commanding said regiment, which charges were forwarded to the Secretary of War, from Omaha, Neb. . by the committee that drafted them, consisting of I^ee S. Estelle, VV. C. Bartlett and others, and which were referred to me for investigation in connection with a resolution of the House of Representatives of 1 e Legislature of Ne - braska on the same subject. In compliance with second and third indorsements on the resolution of the Nebraska House of Representatives, and with the fifth indorsement on the charges, I personally interviewed evey officer of the Nebraska Regiment on duty with it, and all other officers detached from it who were ac - cessible, and announced the substance of the charges and the resolution to each company and the band; also visiting for the purpose the Regimental Hospital, 1st Reserve Hos - pital and Convalescent Hospital, and invited all officers and men to express their sentiments freely as to the merits of said charges and their opinion of Colonel Stotsenburg, as - suring them, particularly the enlisted men, that if they spoke what they believed to be the truth, no punishment as a consequence need be feared. , Some of the officers preferred to make written replies, and were, of course, permitted to do so, while others pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p732">721 ferred to dictate what they had to say, which was set down by me, and was afterwards read to and approved by them. Similarly the sentiments of the men were committed to writing by me, and were subsequently read to and approved by them, excepting that the replies of Company "E," being taken down verbatim by a stenographer, were not thus read. The sentiments of the enlisted men were as follows: A few men expressed themselves. Some thought that Colonel Stotsenburg had been too severe when he took com - mand of the regiment, and approved excessive fines, and had kept men too closely confined to their barracks; that since the regiment had been in the field they had no com - plaint whatever to make, and would follow him anywhere. Two men spoke of sick men being ordered to duty when the Colonel was called upon to report the health of the regiment. Others thought that Colonel Stotsenburg had done his k)le duty by the regiment, and that they were perfectly sfied with him. I'AXY "B" (Most of the men of rhe company were of the opinion t Colonel Stotsenburg's course had been for the best in - ?st of the regiment; that his measures on taking imand were severe, but resulted in making the regiment 1 disciplined and efficient. A few thought that his icy on taking command had been unnecessarily severe, ticularly in the matter of making men do duty who had n reported sick. All agreed that since the regiment had n in the field his conduct had been all that could be de - :d, and that they could not wish for a better leader. 4t&gt; COMPANY "A" </seg>
            <seg id="p733">722 ADJUTANT GENERAL'S RKPORT. COMPANY " C " — A number of men expressed themselves to the effect that Colonel Stotsenburg had, in their opinion, done his best to promote the discipline, efficiency and general wel - fare of the regiment. That although his measures were at times severe, yet they were justified by the results. Sev - eral particularly praised his handling of the regiment in the field, and said they would rather have him for Colonel than any man they knew. The company after being dismissed gave three cheers for Colonel Stotsenburg. COMPANY " I) " Several men spoke expressing their dissatisfaction with the way the men were fed on the transport, and, as they understand Major Stotsenburg was appointed mess officer, they think he was partly responsible for it. Also that the fine of ten cents was illegally placed on the muster roll, al - though they don't think he was responsible for it. Others thought that his methods were too severe when the regiment was quartered at Manila; that the guard duty was too severe then, and is much too severe on this particu - lar company now. Many thought that since he had command of the regiment the men had gotten all they were entitled to in the way of rations and clothing; that he looked out well for the regiment; that although he worked and drilled them haid, his methods had made the regiment efficient, and they thought he was an excellent leader in the field.

There was a general agreement that since the fighting began Colonel Stotsenburg had conducted himself so as to win the approval of every one. That he was a good man to follow. Some expressed themselves to the effect that his con - duct in the field had redeemed his conduct when the regi - ment was in the city. Private H. D. Merritt stated that]when in the city he had done between two and three weeks mason work on the quarters and bought materials for the'purpose to the value of $5.00 or $6.00 (Mexican 1, paying for it out of his own pocket; that Colonel Stotsenburg had failed to pay him the money back, although he had given him the bill for it and asked payment. Private David McFry stated that he had been placed on duty by Colonel Stotsenburg when he was on the sick report, and very sick. The next day he had to go to the Regimental Hospital; was carried there and stayed there for about fifty days. States that the men in Major Stotsen - burg's battalion were kept too closely confined in unsuitable barracks during the first month in Manila. Private Russell expressed himself to the same effect about the barracks. McFry added that in the field Colonel Stotsenburg was all right.

They stated that there was no justice in the com - nt of improper treatment on the transport by Major senburg; that Major Stotsenburg had helped tostraighten out the confusion that first existed and to secure each com - pany an equitable portion of the desirable quarters on the ship.

That they think differently now, and would think it a misfortune to be there instead of in the field.

REGIMENTAL HOSPITAL — iln the Regimental Hospital between twenty-five and y patients and attendants were interviewed. No dis - faction was expressed with Colonel Stotsenburg and no complaints made. Men were practically unanimous that he had done his duty by the regiment and always had the in - terests of the regiment at heart; that while it seemed at the time to some that his discipline, while the regiment was quartered at Manila, was unnecessarily severe, most of the men realize now that what he did promoted the health and welfare of the regiment.

CAPTAIN ZEIUNGER, COMMANDING COMPANY "K" Has no complaint to make of the way Colonel Stotsen - burg has handled the regiment and treated the enlisted men since he has been in command. Thinks that when Colonel Stotsenburg first took command he was quite severe in enforcing discipline, but that it has steadily improved since, and that the regiment is now in a good state of discipline and of excellent efficiency; also that the change from the city to camp has worked improvement. Also that the conduct of the Colonel when in action is all that could be desired. He encourages the aien and looks after their efficiency on the firing line in a most commendable way. FIRST LIEUTENANT AND ADJUTANT HARRY ARCHER — Says he was Battalion Adjutant for Major Stotsenburg and is now Regimental Adjutant. He has seen the charges and there is not a word of truth in them. Thinks Colonel Stotsenburg is one of the finest officers he ever knew. He has been the life of the regiment ever since he was made Colonel. He has enforced rigid discipline but not severer than was necessary and for the best interests of the men. He has looked after their health and comfort and effected many improvements in the condition of the men, especially those sick in the hospital. The discipline and efficiency of the regiment has steadily improved since he became Colonel. States that in his opinion a majority of the charges have no foundation.

Nevertheless it will be seen that the sentiments of practically the entire regiment have been obtained and set forth in detail. It will be seen that the overwhelming majority of the officers and men of the regiment, either directly or by natural inference, strongly condemn and refute the charges and cor - dially endorse Colonel Stotsenburg's administration, both as Battalion and Regimental Commander, and that not one officer or enlisted man expresses the opinion that it would be for the best interest of the regiment to relieve him from the command of it. The charges therefore receiving practically no support or sympathy from the men in whose interest and on whose be - half they purport to have been preferred, fall to the ground.

James O'Connell, Clerk in Regiment Headquarters, 1st Nebraska United States Volunteers, concerning the charges against Colonel John M.

That since the opening of hostilities, so far as I am able to judge, he has proven himself to be an officer remarkable for forethought, bravery, and care for the lives and welfare of his men. The regiment has absolute confi - dence in his courage and ability. In this connection this remark, often heard, may not be out of place, 'We would not exchange him for any officer in the army;' very likely there are others as able, perhaps more able, but we know him. we don't them."

            <seg id="p749">738 v xiiarci , were called into service oy the viovernor, /Vpril 2jth, 189S, I was the senior Captain of the brigade, being in com - mand of Company "(.}," 2nd Regiment, known as the Omaha Guards. I had never met Colonel Stotsenbrng but once before (when he read a paper before a meeting of the officers of the National Guard of Nebraska), so that, when he was detailed as Mustering Officer at Lincoln, at which point the State Guard was ordered to assemble, he was practically a stranger to us. As a result of the physical examination held before mustering in at Lincoln a number of officers were rejected, among whom were several officers of the two regiments, and as I was the senior Captain, I was naturally in line for the first promotion. Hearing unofficially that I was to be promoted to Major and transferred to the 1st Regiment, I called upon Governor Holcoinb out (.veiling at his office in the capitol before any official announcement had been made regarding any promotions. Governor Holcomb confirmed the rumor, and told me I was to be appointed Major and transferred to the 1st Regiment, at which I entered pi' saying that I would prefer to remain with my own regiment, especially as the officers of the 1st Regiment had made a protest to the Governor that no officers should be transferred from the 2nd to the 1st Regiment. The Governor listened carefully to my requests, and said he would do what he thought best for the interests of the service. During our conversation the Governor asked my opinion regarding the appointment of a regular army officer to a commission in one of the State regiments, saying that many of the State officers were opposed to the idea, thinking that there were plenty of officers in the State service capable of filling all the regimental offices. Knowing that the officers of the </seg>
            <seg id="p750">ADJUTANT CKXKRAl.'S REPORT. 739 National Guard had had no opportunity to gain experience in field work, no matter how well posted they might be on drill, I expressed my opinion to the Governor that I consid - ered it would be of great advantage to the State to have a regular army officer with one of the regiments, and that I favored the idea, even if such a course resulted in causing me to lose a file in promotion, and I then requested the Governor to assign me to whichever regiment he appointed a regular officer. Before leaving the Governor informed me that he had practically decided to appoint Colonel Stotsen - burg a Major in one of the regiments, and as it happened that there was but one vacancy of Major in the 2nd Regi - ment and two vacancies in the ist Regiment, in order to comply with my second request, my first could not be granted, and I was consequently transferred to the ist Regi - ment. I am satisfied that any cflarge of underhand work against Colonel Stotsenburg, in securing a commission in the regiment, is without any foundation in fact. He worked untiringly at Lincoln to get the troops mustered in and fitted out, and it is a well known fact that the ist Nebraska was the first regiment to reach Camp Merritt, and was also the best equipped of any volunteer regiment entering San Fran - cisco, and I consider these facts entirely due to the efforts of Colonel Stotsenburg. As Colonel Bratt was Colonel of the regiment until last November, all charges against Colonel Stotsenburg during stay in Camp Merritt, voyage on transport, stay in Camp Dewey, etc., require no attention, as they do not enter into the case. Colonel Bratt is the one to answer those. Re - garding fines of $3.00 against various men, it is well known that the Colonel of a regiment does not impose fines, but that fines are imposed by the Summary Court Officer. </seg>
            <seg id="p751">740 ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. I would respectfully state that I was appointed Summary- Court Officer for the regiment about September ist, 1898, and have held that position continuously ever since and still hold it. There has never been a fine of $3.00 imposed upon any man in the regiment for being unshaved, the greatest fine being $1.00 for that offence. In every company in the regiment were enlisted men who were either lazy, shiftless, or who had no idea of discipline and thought going to war -omething like going to a strawberry festival, where all kinds of refreshments would be furnished, and some one to wait upon them would also be supplied. It was such men as these that the Summary Court was kept busy with, and it was such as these who get up such resolutions as those in question; men who are a disgrace to the regiment, to the State, and to the name soldier. I regret that the good people of Omaha should Tiave listened to such as those. §\Vhen the ist Regiment marched into San Francisco it as fine a body of troops as I ever saw together, as far as erial was concerned, and the regiment was well drilled well disciplined. I When Colonel Bratt left Manila last November, the ment was in a demoralized condition, divided into fac - s, with poor discipline, and in such a shape that I, for was ashamed of its condition. As soon as Colonel senburg was placed in command, the regiment began to rove, until it reached a condition, equal, at least, to any ment in the Corps. I considered that Colonel Stotsen - y has administered the affairs of the regiment in a fair, artial manner, and has worked continually to do every - ig in his power to better the condition of the regiment, has always labored for the enlisted men of the regiment, treated them with every consideration, and has always </seg>

Stotsenburg some ten months, and I find him a man of irreproachable character and as a man and brave soldier I can only speak of him in the highest terms. It is my personal opinion that the alleged charges are uncalled for, and furthermore, unfounded. I venture to say I know of no officer whom is deserving of more praise and honor than he. His hard work and efforts for the good of the men of his regiment, regarding their military train - ing, comfort, health and moral standing, has been untiring, and I am glad to be under the immediate command of so </seg>

Military speaking, he is strict, that is true enough, but no more strict than any other officer would be in his position. He is not the strict man or tyrant that he has been pictured by any means, and I think a great injustice has been done an innocent man. Again, all that I can say of Col. J. M. Stotsenberg is the highest of praise for him as a man and a soldier. Respectfully, Captain and Assistant Surgeon, ist Nebraska U. S. V. Inf. Exhibit E.

Mallory, Inspector General, 8th Army Corps: I Sir — I have the honor to submit the following in lience to your request regarding the " Stotsenburg Res - ions:" The resolutions are based upon letters written by dissat - isfied "tin soldiers," members of Company "L." A ma jority of the charges are wholly unfounded, the balance mis - placed. I do not know the leaders in the movement per - sonally, but my experience in the National Guard shows conclusively that in general Company " L " has always manipulated the election of " Field Officers;" they were the political pullers, and consequently they were the " pets " of all the officers who were ambitious.

            <seg id="p755">744 Three Lieutenants at the breaking oat of the war are now commanding companies, two of companies of other towns than Omaha. They were the favored ones of the regiment, and con - tinually boast that fact, and when they were not petted, coaxed and made lots of, when they had to wear the same uniform, do the same duty, were justly and deservedly criti - cised as others were, they felt bad. If more of them were fined than in other companies, they were more careless, more negligent, and did not understand the duties of a sol - dier as well as the others did, although Colonel Stotsenburg had nothing at all to do with the fines. Company " K " had, to say the least, never been fav - ored; did as much work as any, and there is not a single, solitary man among its members who has been " tyranni - cally " or "unjustly" treated, or imagined himself so. They were properly instructed in their duties and knew what to expect in a campaign. Colonel Stotsenburg is not a volunteer officer, a " hail fellow, well met." He is abrupt, short, and always at work; he understands his profession thoroughly, knows law and devotes all his time to the betterment of the regiment and each individual. He is strict, the best disciplinarian I have ever met. A regimental camp with him is a model of clean - liness, order and system. He is the first one to rise and the last one to retire, he is everywhere, and, to the offender, slouch or shirker, like an apparition. He neither smokes, chews nor drinks; he is not a society man, but devotes his entire time, his thoughts and actions to his life work. He. is a professional soldier, and, in my opinion — and I am no pet nor preferred companion of his — he is the best, most thor - ough, the most fearless and cool I have ever heard of or read about. He knows what a soldier is entitled to, and </seg>
            <seg id="p756">745 our men get it. He is a Quartermaster, a Commissary, a til Master and, in fact, an expert in all branches of the •ice. The ist Nebraska is of all volunteer regiments the best equipped, the best fed and best drilled regiment in the Phil - ippines. It fought as hard as any, as bravely as any, we have more guard and outpost duty than any other regiment, on account of the distance we cover, we are further out than any other, and we are very proud of our regiment, and I "think" justly so, but we are just as proud of our Colonel and that I "know" so. He made our regiment what it is and if the political element could be suppressed, if all po - litical features could be eliminated and the Colonel given full power to act, his services would soon be recognized and acknowledged and if nothing would be taken into considera - tion but merit he would be a Brigadier General very shortly and deservedly so. A full investigation of the charges will have the oppo - site effect from that desired by the element making them. The services rendered, the cares bestowed, the hard, inces - sent work for the regiment by Colonel Stotsenburg would otherwise never have reached public attention and recogni - tion they deserve. I am a volunteer; a civilian, a profes - sional man — not in the science of war, however — I have a family and would like to be home, but under the command of Colonel Stotsenburg I will take my company anywhere. I admire talent, energy and judgment, therefore I hope the merits of our Colonel will be justly appreciated and suitably - rewarded. Very respectfully your obedient servant. (Signed) J. N.

The charges in part may have some reference to the Stotsenburg administration, but as a whole investigation will show that they were prior to his time, and as investigation does not concern the former Colonel, can hardly see why I should express my opinion in the matter. Had it not been for Major Stotsenburg, our regiment, during the voyage and in the campaign before Ma - nila, would have been in a much more deplorable condition. Since commissioned Colonel he has exerted his entire energy to put the regiment in first-class condition. He has obtained better quarters, more commissary supplies and quartermaster stores, and has advanced the men in drill regulations, disci - pline and decorum. In regard to my company I think the men will follow Colonel Stotsenburg to the end, as they ad - mire his coolness, bravery and good judgment.

Of the incidents related in many of the charges the Colonel has no knowledge whatever as a participant. I consider Colonel Stotsenbnrg a perfect gentlemen, and hav - ing been with him on many occasions as Adjutant of the regimejit, I have never noticed him to act otherwise to either officers or men. As an officer he has always done his duty both to the Government and the regiment. He has by his own unaided, untiring and zealous efforts advanced and improved the regiment both as to discipline and appearance, until it now compares favorably with any in the service, attested by its inspection on January ist, and the report of the Hrigade Surgeon as to its health and cleanliness. As to his ability in the field, I leave that for the endorsement of his superior officers, and to the record of the regiment in the present campaign to determine. As to the alleged "petty tyranny" it is simply pre - posterous. In order to enforce discipline it became nect to fine and punish offenders against military law and order; for instance, uncleanliness in person or uniform and dis - obedience of and inattention to the general and special orders of sentinals on duty at a time when carlessness meant disaster to our forces, and untidiness laid the United States forces open to criticism by foreign critics. That such fines and penalties have been beneficial is proven by the increased health and appearance of the regi - ment. I am aware of numerous cases where the Colonel, unknown to those interested, has on behalf of officers and men under sentence interceded and asked for mercy and mitigation; this is not the character displayed by "petty tyrair </seg>

I also ask you to examine the correspondence relating to the "stolen stores'" and "army cook" on file in the Adjutant's office, and the General Orders relating to guard and other duties in the Adjutant General's office of the Brigades, and Divisions to which this regiment has been attached.

This is not the first time this company has made itself famous for kicking. The same organization engaged in a competitive drill in Texas and they have not finished their whining yet. They could not be winners that time, and then, as now, they chose to proclaim themselves as martyrs. Some of the members of this company iThurston Rifles, or rather more appropriately "Omaha's Meddlesome Dudes" I, accustomed to holding "salaried positions of $2,000 per year (see charge 81, found that in exchanging those positions of ease and luxury for the proud position of a soldier of the United States, they had made the one great mistake of a lifetime. Discovering their mistake they lacked the honesty to place the responsibility where it belonged — upon their own shoulders. Company "L" and its members received every comfort that was accorded other companies in the regiment — in fact, Company "L" always received the best. Many is the time they have boasted of having more men de - tailed in "snap positions" than any other company in the regiment. They also boast that they have more promotions to their credit than any other. Where have they been slighted? Perhaps, they base their complaint against the Colonel for his failure to give more, and charge him with a violation of that passage of the Scriptures which says: "To them that hath shall be given, and from them that hath not shall be taken even that which they have." It is useless for Company "L," to reply that they made </seg>

            <seg id="p776">761 In many cases my opinions and ideas of enforcing dis - cipline might have been different, yet the difference in opinion as to the methods employed and not the ultimate result to be obtained. The discipline has not been severe except in a few cases where- it seemed to be accessary , and as far as shown, the restrictions were as light as possible without endangering the efficiency of the command. When we recall certain incidents in the military man - agement we may find that methods now in vogue in the regular army were used. These perhaps seemed severe to the volunteers who were not accustomed to such management. The fir.e appearance of the men and companies in the regiment at different inspections at Camp Santa Mesa strong argument in favor of Colonel John M. Stotseuburg's management of a regiment. Since February 14th, the 1st Nebraska in the field has made a glorious record, one that when the regiment returns will be cited by our friends as honorable and true. The men have further proved that they are a body of steady, well disciplined righting men. The mistaken opinions and misdirected zeal of frit of the i&lt;t Nebraska is due almost entirely to a misu: standing of Colonel Stotsenburg's actions and also the com - plaints of some who did not find military life so much to their liking as they expected.

Exact copy is herewith enclosed. To the Fifth. I desire to leave Col. Hratt out of this matter entirely. A little wholesome explanation will be in order, so that this matter may be set right before all. I think about seventy-five dollars worth of cocoanuts and bananas were bought al Honolulu for use of the men on the voyage. This fruit I ordered to take entire for my own battalion, but Col. Hratt preferred to keep it for tin. iuent to use at the latter end of the voyage. It seems that some of the unruly spirits, and there were some i:i the regiment at that time, considered that the. a perfect right to take the fruit without leave, although ers were willing to pay for it. I supf* Bratt received a great deal of unnecessary criticism en this account. The fruit was divided up equally among the companies and they were asked to pay cost for it. If any company did not want it, others would have taken it. and paid lor it just like any other stores are paid for when delivered. To the Sixth. I suppose I was responsible for all the regiments of the second Philippine expedition having to pay their cooks. If any one thinks so, let him read the'letterof Messrs. Goodale, Perkins &amp; Co., enclosed herewith. Furthermore, all the Company Commanders were asked to my tent at Camp Merritt where the messing arrangements of the officers and men were fully explained to them and they were told to explain it to their men.

To this charge I have to plead en - tire ignorance on account of my being absent when the circumstance arose, on duty with a military commission of which I was a member. This I did with the assurance on the part of one Captain that the matter would be adjusted if it could not be compromised. The other Captain held out longer on account of some personal feeling of unjust treat - ment on the part of Colonel Bratt.

I did not go on duty until my battalion went out into the trenches. By that time all the bunks had been purchased; paying for them was an afterthought of the Quartermaster's Depart - ment. I believe the accounts of the men were sent to Major Jones. Why they were not paid, or whether other regi - ments were paid, is a question he might be able to answer.

I am readv to meet any specific charge of any officer or man, in or out of the army, on the subject. It seems strange that no such charge was ever filed here, where every officer and soldier knows that it will receive proper attention and consideration. To the Fifteenth. I am not only surprised but pleased at my influence over Generals Merritt, Otis, (ireene, Gov - ernor Holcomb and those in authority generally. But I must really throw the responsibilitv for the overcrowding of the "Senator" on the Board of Officers of the Army and Navy, as well as the Medical Board who examined it. I never saw the vessel until the day before we boarded her. I am sorry that I did not know of this hypnotic influence sooner, but I suppose it is only appreciated by those who do not know me personally or my record. As far as the messing on the steamship "Senator" is con - cerned, will say that there was a large quantity of Govern - ment stores of that vessel consigned to the Quartermaster and Commissary at Manila. I did not presume to break into these stores, but I did try by every means in my power to issue our own rations and to teach the men how to issue them properly; I knew very well that it would seem a hard - ship to many to come down to the regular army rations after picnicking on oranges, cake and pie at Lincoln and San Francisco. I am satisfied to let the officers of the "Senator" pass judgment on my efforts. As far as the rejection of Major Scharman is concerned, Governor Holcomb never did me the honor to consult me about his appointments and commissions, except in so far as the University cadets were concerned. He did </seg>

From this time forward the regiment performed its full share of outpost and other duties, taking part in most of the mau\ skirmishes with the Spanish, and bore the brunt of the general engagement of the night attack of August 2nd.

In this engagement we lost only one man killed and seven wounded, which was clue to the thorough discipline of the firing line, which was in charge of and directed by Lieut. -Col.

            <seg id="p1306">ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. 1303 Headquarters First Brigade, Nebraska National Guard. Beatrice, Neb., January 24, 1891. To the Adjutant General of Nebraska: tSiR — I have the honor to make the following report of service of the Nebraska National Guard under my coin - d in the protection of the lives and property of the citi - ; of Nebraska, against Indian depredations, in the cam- of 1890-91. I On November 21st, 1890, in view of the possibility of military force of the State being required for actual ser - in the suppression oi the threatened Indian outbreak, I cted the commanders of the 1st and 2nd Infantry Regi - its, and of the artillery and cavalry companies to report le the number of officers and men of their commands, :ient for immediate service, and further directed them to e the several companies of their commands in readiness service in the field. I thereafter notified the Governor of my action, and on November 24th reported to him the strength and availability of the military force under my command, which was com - posed of two regiments of infantry, of ten companies each, one troop of cavalry and a battery, or company, of light ar - tillery. During the first weeks in December, companies of the United States Army were transferred to Pine Ridge Agency, South Dakota, and points adjacent; and also many of the cities and towns along the northwestern boundaries of Ne - braska were supplied with arms and ammunition, from the State, some five hundred rifles and over twelve thousand rounds of ammunition being furnished. </seg>
            <seg id="p1307">1304 This action seemed to allay the public anxiety for the time being. However, towards the latter part of December it was found that the arrangements for arming citizens and forming local military companies in the vicinity of the ex - pected trouble in addition to the forces of the United States were not sufficient to quiet the fears of the families upon the frontier nearest to the Indian Reservation. The appearance of Indian hostilities became daily more alarming; a conflict seemed inevitable. The settlers upon the ranches and even the citizens of the towns lying along the northwestern borders were all clamoring for protection; towns and cities were being filled with refugees, and many were leaving the State for their friends and former homes in the East. On December 26th the Governor personally instructed me to place the 1st Brigade of the Nebraska National Guard under my command, in readiness for marching orders, so that in case of a sudden outbreak they could be brought into the field without unnecessary delay. On December 29th the report of the battle on Wounded Knee creek was sent over the wires, and the following days showed attempts to fire the Agency buildings and Mission school, the shooting of the fire arrows, the attacks on the Agency, and the retreat of the four thousand hostile Indians to the Bad Lands along White river, about fifteen miles north of the Nebraska line. A general Indian war, involving all the tribes of the powerful Sioux nation, upon the northwestern borders of Nebraska, seemed unavoidable; the danger to the lives and property of the citizens of our State was imminent. There being no funds provided for the State available for the sup - port and maintenance of the National Guard in the field, I </seg>
            <seg id="p1308">J 1305 tendered the services of my command to the State in its em - ergency free; without consulting officers or men,, believing that I expressed the patriotic sentiments which have always pervaded my command, and relying upon the Legislature when it convened to do justice to those who were willing to risk their lives in the defense of the property and homes of the citizens of Nebraska, without regard to politics. &lt; &gt;n January 2nd, 1 891, I received General Orders No. 1, A. G. O., commanding me to place the 1st Brigade, Nebraska National Guard, under my command in readiness to march on short notice; and pursuant thereto the Commanders of the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Infantry, of Company "A," Light Artillery, and Troop "A," Cavalry, were ordered to place their commands in readiness to march, and were also instructed to have officers and men provided with blankets, overcoats and warm clothing, and at least three days' rations. On the afternoon of the same day, by order of the Gov - ernor, the following companies of my command were moved to the front for defense against the Indian depreda - tions: From 1st Infantry Regiment — Company "A" from York, and Company "G" from Gen - eva, to Rushville over the F., E. &amp; If. V. R. R. Company "E" from Fremont to Chadron, over the F.,E. &amp; II. V. R. R. and Company "K" from Central City to Craw - ford, over the B. &amp; M. R. R. R., via Aurora. From 2nd Infantry Regiment — Company "H" from Tekamah to Gordon, over P., E. &amp; M. V. R.R. and Company "B" from Ord to Crawford, over B. &amp; M. R. R. R., via Aurora.

            <seg id="p1309">1306 Geneva to Rushville, and Quartermaster Wilson of the 2nd Regiment, moved with Company "H" from Tekamah to Gordon. On January 3rd, i8yi, reports of increasing hostilities and skirmishing came from near Pine Ridge Agency on the Nebraska borders; great excitement prevailed, and settlers were hastily leaving their homes and pouring into the towns from Valentine to Harrison for better protection. On the morning of January 4th, I received General Or - ders from the Governor to move my command, or so much thereof as might be available, to the northwestern part of the State, to points most advantageous for the defense of the citizens against the Indians, and to see that the troops under my command were provided for as well as possible under the circumstances. All Brigade staff officers were ordered to report at once, and I moved the several infantry companies of the 1st and 2nd Regiments from their several company stations by the first regular trains, as follows: First Regiment — Company "B" from Sutton to Crawford, over K. C. &amp; O. R. R. R. to York and thence over B. &amp; If. R. R. R. Company "C from Beatrice to Valentine, over B. &amp; If. R. R. R. to Lincoln, thence over F., E. &amp; If. V. R. R.

Regimental Commanders, with field and staff, were ordered to move with their commands and report to me per - sonally at Rushville, at which point I arrived by first train. Brigade Headquarters were at once established at Rush - ville; I found the situation in Nebraska, critical; the people were very much excited both in and out of the towns, along the line of the P., E. &amp; If. V. R. R. extending for about one hundred and fifty miles east and west, and thirty miles north and south, and there were urgent demands for troops as far as Hemingford on the B. &amp; M. R. R. R., sixty miles southward from the Indian Reservation. Hundreds of settlers had left their homes, and gathered into the towns, leaving their stock unprovided for, and in many instances, starving. At Chadron there were some one hundred and thirty families of settlers gathered in from the outlying country with little or no money, and dependent mainly upon the public for shelter and food; and this same condition existed in a more or less degree, all along the line from Harrison to Valentine. Officers were immediately dis - patched to each of the towns between and including the points named, with instructions to examine and report the facts. The Company Commanders at Valentine, Cody, </seg>
            <seg id="p1311">1308 ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT. Harrison, were also required to report at once to Brigade Headquarters, the actual condition of things at their re - spective stations, including apparent danger, causes of alarm, and the necessity for troops. Col. W. F. Cody, Aide-de-Camp upon the Governor's Staff, reported to Brigade Headquarters for special duty by order of the Governor, and was directed to learn and report the location of the hostile Indians and the main points of danger to Nebraska citizens, and for this purpose went to Pine Ridge Agency, S. D., which is about twenty-six miles north of Rushville, and two miles from the Nebraska boundary. William Vlander, a half-breed Indian, trusty and competent, was employed as general scout and guide for Brigade Headquarters, and dispatched to gain any re - liable information possible from the Indians, and report to Headquarters. Upon receiving reports from these sources, I concluded that the country actually in danger and most liable to surfer devastation in case of an outbreak among the Indians, who were enclosed or surrounded by the United States forces, under command of Maj.-Gen. Miles was that portion lying almost directly south of the Indian Reserva - tion, between White river on the west and the Sand Hills on the east, extending from Chadron to a few miles beyond Gordon, a distance in a straight line of about forty miles. Having established the Quartermaster, Commissary and Medical Departments, with a basis of supplies at Rushville, and believing that the post of a soldier should be the place of danger, and that confidence would be restored, and the people protected by placing the State troops between the settlements and the hostile Indians, I determined upon establishing a line of fortified posts or camps north of the line of railroad stations from eight to twenty miles, and be- </seg>

In pursuance of this plan two companies were at once moved about ten miles north of Gordon; two companies twelve miles north of Rushville, and two companies to the crossing of White river about ten miles north of Chadron, with orders to establish a post, fortify by pits, trenches and earthworks, and prevent surprise by establishing camp guards, picket lines, out-posts and vidette stations. I For the purpose of establishing and keeping up corn - lications between each of these posts and the railroad sta - s, a system of mounted citizen-couriers, who were em - red on the credit of the State from among the resident sens, for that purpose, was established. This disposi - i of the troops was accomplished promptly and without dent, although their movements were somewhat im - ed by a snowstorm, and the weather becoming much tThe immediate presence of the State troops at once e encouragement to the people, and the location of these out-posts further aided in giving them more confidence, the stations were so far apart that the fears of the peo - still continued, and especially at points not covered by advance. I For the purpose of completing the line of fortified posts, i making them effective as protection to the citizens, and ;re being no reasonable grounds for alarm at points west Chadron and east of Gordon, the companies stationed at ilentine, Cody, Crawford and Harrison, were ordered into ; field of actual danger in front of the Reservation, and six uv posts were established on the general line of the others, </seg>

These movements made a complete line of fortified camps between the outlying ranches and the hostile Indians. The several companies of my command were posted along the line and district of threatened danger, substan - tially as follows: Company "I," ist Regiment, at Chadron. Companies "E" and "F," ist Regiment, near Mad - den's bridge, at the crossing of White river near the mouth of the Big Bordeaux creek.

George Lyons as Aide-de-Camp upon the staff of the Brigadier General </seg>
