            <seg id="p004">GENERAL SUMMARY 1. Calves fed upon a ration of shelled corn and alfalfa hay made much more economical gains than did 3-year-olds, 2 - year-olds, or yearlings fed upon the same ration. 2. Three-year-old and 2-year-old steers gained much more rapidly during the first. 100-day period than did yearlings and calves. 3. During the second 100 days on feed, calves gained some - what more rapidly than during the first and much more rapidly than older cattle. 4. Calves made more efficient gains during the second 100 - day period than did 3-year-olds and 2-year-olds during the first 100 days, and gained as economically as did yearlings during their first 100-day period. 5. Calves made as much gain from 61.2 pounds of feed as did yearlings from 82.2 pounds, 2-year-olds from 9.4.2 pounds, and 3-year-olds from 100 pounds. 6. Calves made 10.6 pounds of gain from one bushel of corn and 19.6 pounds of alfalfa hay; yearlings made 8 pounds of gain from one bushel of corn and 22 pounds of alfalfa hay; 2-year-olds made 6.9 pounds of gain from one bushel of corn and 22 pounds of alfalfa hay ; and 3-year-olds made 6.7 pounds of gain from the same quantity of corn and 23.3 pounds of alfalfa hay. 7. One hundred pounds of gain were produced on calves by 529 pounds of corn, while 702 pounds were required for 100 pounds of gain on yearlings, 798 pounds on 2-year-olds, and 836 pounds on 3-year-olds. The alfalfa supplement necessary to produce gain increased in like proportion. 8. The younger the cattle, fhe less spread necessary be - tween cost and sales price for an even break. 9. Three-year-old steers develop finish quite rapidly and can be sold as beef after 75 to 100 days of feeding on corn and alfalfa. Younger cattle, especially calves, must be fed longer in order to acquire acceptable finish. 10. The ;calves used in these three trials were worth more as feeders after being fed 100 days than they were as killers. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Fattening Steers of Various Ages H. J. GRAMLICH • During recent years the beef industry has undergone vast changes. These have been made necessary in part by eco - nomic conditions and in part by changes in the demands of the American people. The tendency has been toward earlier marketing of steers, so that instead of going to the block as mature individuals at from 3 to 5 years of age, they are now reaching the market at a much younger age. In consuming centers where only heavy carcasses of beef were demanded formerly there is a call today for carcasses of the yearling and long yearling class. Retailers say that their patrons insist on light -cuts, not too wasty in surplus fat. This demand is evidenced in the coolers of the large packers and by their buyers at the stockyards. During the recent financial depres - sion the tendency has been to realize as quickly as possible upon investments in livestock, and this has augmented the tendency toward feeding younger cattle. Thru earlier market - ing the producer realizes on the steer from 6 months to 2 years sooner than he formerly did. Because of this tendency toward the marketing of beef cattle at a very young age, it became apparent that some experimentation to show what age has to do with cost and rate of gains was needed. The experiments reported in this bulletin cover a 4-year period from October, 1920, to May, 1924. There were 4 trials, each beginning in October and ending in May. The major part of this bulletin is devoted to a report of the last 3 trials. The first trial is not averaged with the others because in it 3 instead of 4 lots were used and a ration different from that of the following 3 trials was fed. This first trial is treated in an appendix at the end of the bulletin. ' OBJECTS OF THE EXPERIMENT This series of trials was carried on with the object of ascertaining what steers of similar breeding but of different ages would do when fed under like conditions. It is offered for the benefit of the man who buys western cattle, either on the market or directly from the range districts, and for the benefit of the man in the corn belt who maintains a small herd of grade or purebred beef cows and desires to fatten their • The fecdiner was supervised by Charles Johnson, head herdsman at the University. Milo Sherman, a student, did the feedine in the first 3 trials. Walter Ruden, another student, did the feeding in the last trial. W. F. Dick-inn, a eraduate student, rendered much assistance in compiling data for the charts. Thanks are due John Clay &amp; Com - pany for appraising the cattle at periods in each of the trials. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 229 closed between May 14 and 19; consequently they were carried thru like seasons each year, and at the same time thru a season which would be typical of the feeding period used on the majority, of farms. FEEDING Grain was fed regularly at 7 a. m. and 4:30 p. m. Hay W^ s » e^ s * 0T Py thereafter. The plan was to get all lots on a i/ u ii ? f corn S radu ally and to diminish the amount of alfalfa as the corn was increased. As indicated previously, the rations fed were the same in all groups. Corn was fed rather liberally after the cattle became used to it. In other words, the steers were encouraged to consume practically a full feed as soon as they would handle it. The aim was to feed a quantity which would be cleaned up within an hour to an hour and a half after placing in the bunks. At the outset, it seemed best to permit the cattle to have approximately all of the hay they would take. There was virtually no weigh - back of hay at any time. WEIGHING, APPRAISING, AND MARKETING Individual weights were taken upon three consecutive days at the opening and at the close of each trial. Group weights were taken every 25-day period, with individual weights at 50- and 100-day periods. Starting with the seventy-fifth day experts from the Omaha market appraised the various groups upon each weigh-day. The cattle were weighed at 8 o'clock in the morning and in no instance were they held from water or m any way prepared for weighing. After the official termination of the trial, oats and prairie hay were fed 36 hours in order to condition the cattle for shipment The tables show periodic gains made by each group and, likewise, the time at which each could have been marketed with the best financial result. Fluctuations in profit or loss are governed quite largely by variations in markets and too much importance should not be placed upon these figures, altho they tend to show quite consistently that following a short feed the older cattle could have been marketed to better advantage than the younger ones. This was due to variations in the degree of -finish in the several lots at such times. EXPERIMENTAL DATA For the purpose of brevity, complete reports of each project have been omitted from this bulletin. Upon the pages which follow will be found a series of tables which contain considerable data pertaining to each trial. The data in Table 1 were procured by taking a weighted average of the three experiments. </seg>

            <seg id="p016">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 229 Carrying the study of feed records one stage further and noting daily feed consumption by weekly periods, Chart I shows graphically the variation in daily rations of each group. All lots made a fairly rapid increase in corn consumption up to the close of the seventh week. At this time the 3-year-olds were consuming 23 pounds daily, the 2-year-olds 18.5 pounds, the yearlings 14 pounds, and the calves 9.75 pounds. Follow - ing this date, there was a slight drop in Lots 1 and 2, then a material increase to the fifteenth week, at which time the maximum corn consumption occurred in both Lots 1 and 2, and practically the maximum in Lot 3. At this time the 3 - year-olds were consuming 27.25 pounds of corn daily, the 2 - year-olds 21 pounds, the yearlings 18 pounds, and the calves 12.5 pounds. The calves, following this date, showed a rather gradual increase to the close, at which time they were con - suming 15.5 pounds of corn. Thus they show an increase of 5 pounds in daily consumption from the end of the first 100 days to the end of the second. The 3-year-old steers that were consuming 27.25 pounds of corn per day at the end of the first 100 days showed a daily consumption of less than 23 pounds at the close, hence a decrease of 4.25 pounds. It is of interest to note the correlation existent between corn consumption and daily gains in the various lots. The alfalfa consumption curves are much more consistent in their relationship to each other. During the second 100 days they are practically horizontal. Lot 1 consumed 30 pounds per day at the first and this decreased quite rapidly as the corn increased. The hay and the corn consumption in this lot were of equal amount, namely 16.5 pounds, during the fifth week. The hay. consumption in Lot 2 started at 23 pounds and rapidly dropped to 6 at the end of the first 50 days. The corn and the alfalfa consumption in this group were of equal quantity, namely 11.75 pounds, during the fourth week. In the case of Lot 3, the hay consumption opened at 19 pounds and dropped to 6 at the end of the sixth week. The corn and the alfalfa consumption here were equal during the fourth week and crossed on the 10-pound line. In the case of Lot 4, the most hay consumed at the opening was 11 pounds daily. At the end of six weeks the calves were consuming 4 pounds and continued to do so thruout the remainder of the trial. At the beginning of the fourth week, the hay and corn consumption curves crossed at a shade over 6 pounds. </seg>

            <seg id="p019">Fattening Steers of Various Ages 443 pounds and 450 pounds in Lot 4. Thus, the calves ranked second in gain, altho not materially higher than either Lot 2 or 3. The heavy gains made in Trial 2 were partly due to the cattle being quite thin at the outset. The gains as given in Table 7 are on a basis of home weights both at the opening and at the close of the trial. If one were to take the market weights as the closing ones of the trials, the spread between lots would be materially altered inasmuch as the younger cattle did not shrink as many pounds,.per head in shipment as did the older ones. As will be noted in Table 1, upon which all of the figures regarding the experiment ap - pear, the shrink per head by lots was 56, 45, 23, and 17 pounds. Deducting the shrink from the total gain as given above, we would have 461 pounds net on the 3-year-olds, 402 on the 2-year-olds, 420 on the yearlings, and 433 on the calves. Thus the gain made by the calves would show up more favor - ably with those made by the larger cattle. </seg>

In connection with Table 13 one should give cognizance to the fact that corn was not entirely responsible for the gains as indicated, altho the ratio is found to be fairly consistent between lots when the alfalfa is taken into account. FEED REQUIRED PER 100 POUNDS GAIN Table 14.-— Feed required per 100 pounds gain — by 100-day periods 3-yr.-olds 2-yr.-olds Yearlings Calves Pounds Pounds Pounds I Pounds First 100 days: I Shelled corn 586 597 534 T 431 Alfalfa hay. 363 346 304 221 Second 100 days: Shelled corn 1282 1085 916 623 Alfalfa hay 320 272 219 148 There was a tremendous reduction in rate of gain during the second period in Lots 1 and 2, and to some extent in Lot 3. This, together with the fact that the corn consumption in - creased materially during this period, increased the feed re - quirement to produce 100 pounds of gain. Table 14 depicts the change which occurred in a graphic manner. In the 3 - year-olds the amount was more than doubled, in the 2-year - olds it was not quite doubled, in the yearlings it was 1% times as great,' and in the calves 1V&amp;. Hence, all four groups of cattle proved to be less efficient in the utilization of feed during the second 100 days than during the first. While the 3-year-olds made 100 pounds of gain during the first 100 days on 586 pounds of corn and 363 pounds of alfalfa, they required 1,282 pounds of corn and 320 pounds of alfalfa during the second period. During the first 100 days these cattle made pounds of gain from one bushel of corn plus 34 V^ pounds of alfalfa, and during the second period they made 4% pounds of gain from one bushel of corn plus 14 pounds of alfalfa. In each of the three trials the ratio was practically as it appears in the average. The calves required 1% times as much feed to produce 100 pounds of gain during the second 100 days as during the first; nevertheless they made gains on but little more corn and con - siderably less alfalfa during the second period than did either the 2- or the 3-year-olds during the first 100 days. This has material significance in that it indicates very clearly the much greater efficiency of calves in the utilization of feed. </seg>

            <seg id="p040">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 229 Each year the carcasses of the two groups of younger cattle were the favorites of the dressed-beef men. They were smoother, seemed to carry sufficient covering, and were some - what more shapely than the older carcasses. Possibly the fact that the lighter carcasses were more popular on the markets influenced the judgment of the beef men toward these carcasses. They stated that 60 to 75 per cent of the demand for beef at that time was for carcasses weighing from 400 to 600 pounds. This, of course, would include heavy calves and most yearlings. Incidentally, in this bulletin we have referred to the four groups of cattle on a basis of the classification which they held at the time they entered the experiment. At the market Lots 1 and 2 were spoken of as heavy beeves, Lot 3 as long yearlings, and Lot 4 as yearlings. This distinction applied both at the stockyards and at the beef coolers. jWe have avoided the use of these terms in com - menting on the carcasses, however, in order to prevent con - fusion. REPORT BY TRIALS Upon the pages following will be found detailed tables of each of the three trials which are summarized in the fore part of this bulletin ; also, a full report of Trial A, an experi - ment conducted in the winter of 1920-21. These tables are submitted for anyone who might desire to make further com - pilations and to show the striking degree of uniformity of results obtained in this series of trials. With such consist - ency of results as was secured in this series, one would seem justified in drawing the conclusion that they would be sus - tained in future trials of similar nature as well as in actual feed-lot practice. </seg>

T j? st . eera used in this trial were purchased in October, 1920, on the iiraddock ranch at Chadron, Nebraska, and consisted of 10 head of each age. All three groups, 2-year-olds, yearlings, and calves, were sired by the same bull and out of the same group of cows. They had been raised under typical ranch conditions. They were high grade Herefords of j IC ? n &lt; Si ahty# The cost per hund red pounds by lots was $8.75, $9.00, and $9.25 respectively. ' RATIONS All lots were fed upon the same ration, namely, shelled corn, linseed 011 meal, ensilage, and alfalfa hay. The silage was fed liberally at first and diminished as the corn was increased. On January 1, all lots were on a full feed of corn. No oil meal was fed until December 10, 2 pounds per head daily being fed in all lots from then on. During February and March, the steers in aU three lots consumed the maximum ration of corn. At this time, the 2-year-olds consumed 21 pounds per hsad daily, the yearlings 17 pounds, and the calves 14 pounds. The average corn consumption decreased during April and May, being approximately 16 pounds at the close in Lot 1, 14 pounds in Lot 2, and 12 pounds in Lot 3.

FINANCIAL. OUTCOME All groups sold below their initial cost. The calves showed the least loss of the three groups. The necessary selling price in order to break even was $10.80 on the 2-year-olds, $10.50 on the yearlings, and $10.00 on the calves. The above figures do not take labor into account.

            <seg id="p059">Fattening Steers op Various Ages ; SUMMARY OF TRIAL A In this experiment the calves showed relatively greater efficiency in all periods. It will be noted that the economy of gain in each period was very markedly in favor of the calves. Tie yearlings were more economical gainers than the 2-year-olds. The calves produced as much beef from 77% pounds of feed as did the 2-year-olds from 100 pounds. The yearlings produced as much beef from 86 pounds of feed as did the 2-year-olds from 100 pounds. The rate of gain within the three groups during the various periods is quite interesting. During the first 100 days the 2-year-olds gained 264 pounds, the yearlings 251, and the calves 205. During the second 100 days the 2-year-olds gained 177 pounds, the yearlings 191, and the calves 195. In other words, in the first period the older cattle made the greatest daily gain, while in the second period the younger cattle showed the greatest daily gain. Stating it in another way, during the second 100 days the 2-year-olds gained 67 per cent as much as during the first, the yearlings 76 per cent, and the calves 95 per cent. The calves made virtually the same gain during each period, whereas the 2-year-olds gained only two-thirds as much during the latter period as during the first. This point is quite worthy of attention", as it indicates a more consistent gain in the case of the calves. tlOM] </seg>
