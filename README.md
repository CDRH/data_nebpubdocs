# Nebraska Public Documents

This repository houses [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) XML for the [Nebraska Public Documents](http://nebpubdocs.unl.edu/) project.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with the [Datura](https://github.com/CDRH/datura) repository.

This TEI is now several years old and was not created with the standards currently used by the [CDRH](http://cdrh.unl.edu/).
